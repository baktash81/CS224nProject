the theater s greatest
box office draw   
 under the guidance
ofher manager 
william fawcett robinson 
elise mckenna was the first
american actress to create
a my stique in the public s ey e   
 never seen in public
in her lateryears 
 apparently  without
an offstage life 
the absolute quintessence
ofseclusion   
excuse me  do you have
any theater biographies   
that aren t in the racks
under the rare books
or magazines 
well  we do have
some magazines 
but they re in the back

thanks 
i m in the back 
okay

here you are 
oh  thank you 
thank you 
mm hmm 
yes 
uh  hello  yes 
m miss roberts 
yes 
hi  uh  my name s
richard collier 
and i just read your book
on famous american actresses 
and i really enjoyed it a lot 
what is it you want 
information
about elise mckenna 
what sort
of information 
well  i m a playwright 
and i was thinking about
doing a play based on her life 
and  of course 
i d have to talk  
i m sorry 
ma am  please 
please  don t 
this is not for a play 
miss roberts 
this is something
very personal 
i don t understand 
where did you get that 
she gave it to me  ma am 
at the opening night
of a play that i wrote   
at millfield college
about eight years ago 
that watch was
very precious to her 
she never  never left it
out of her possession 
it disappeared
the night she died 
she died that night 
won t you come in 
please 
thank you 
i have some things
i ve been saving
for the theater collection 
that was a costume
from one of the plays
she was in 
miss roberts 
what was she like 
when i knew her 
she was kind and thoughtful 
but she was just
too much within herself 
she  she seemed
empty somehow 
well  she wasn t always
that way  was she 
oh  no  not at all 
people who knew her
when she was young said   
that she was quick and bright
and full of fun 
strong  willful 
not at all the way
she was later 
what made her change 
i don t know 
but the change seems to have
taken place about 1 91 2 
aftershe performed
in a play 
at the grand hotel 
that was her manager 
william robinson 
was he really as strange
as you seemed to indicate
in the book 
there was something strange
about their relationship 
oh  wow  iook at this 
hey  may i 
this is incredible 
of course 
this guy  finney 
he was my philosophy teacher
at millfield 
really  
yeah 
she read that book
over and over 
she had that made 
 ü ü   classical 
 ü ü
what is it 
that s my favorite music
in the whole world 
i don t understand
what s happening 
doctor finney 
you ll have to walk
with me  young man 
i have another class 
what s your name 
collier  sir  richard collier 
student 
uh  yes i was 
nine years ago 
well  i try to make
my classes interesting 
but nine years 
what can i do foryou 
i have a question
foryou  sir 
shoot 
is time travel possible 
that is a question 
let me tell you something 
richard  is it 
yes  sir 
i was in venice
in 1 971 
i was staying in
a very old hotel 
but i mean  very old 
the structure 
the furnishings 
everything 
the atmosphere was aged 
ifyou follow me 
and my room  i felt
as though it was   
a century or more
earlier than 1 971 
you understand 
yes  sir 
so  in other words  then 
the location is very important 
not all important 
but essential 
mm hmm 
the rest is here 
one afternoon  i  
i was lying down
in that room 
all the sights around me   
a part of the past 
even the sounds
i heard 
and i conceived a notion 
what  i asked my self 
ifl attempt
to hy pnotize my  mind 
suggest to it
that it isn t 1971 
but 1 571 
i closed my  ey es   
and fed a suggestion
into my brain 
it s august  1 571 
i am in
the hotel del vecchio 
i spelled out the details
for myself   
and did it
over and over   
and again and again
and again  
and 
well  i ll never
really know  richard 
i ve never done it since 
and i m not sure
i d want to do it again 
i felt exhausted afterwards 
completely washed out 
and if it really
did happen 
i was only there a fraction
of an instant  remember 
  a flicker 
  yes  sir  i understand that 
but you were there 
i thought so 
oh  it wasn t perfect  granted 
how would it be otherwise 
there were objects around me
that were clearly 
from the present 
and i knew they  were there 
oh  if i were going to
try it again  
m i nd you 
i have no such i ntention 
but if i did 
i would disassociate my self
entirely  from the present 
move everything out ofsight
that could possibly 
remind me ofit 
then  who knows 
whoops 
sorry  hey 
hi 
hi  how do you do 
listen  do you have 1 9 1 2 money 
i mean  very specifically  1 9 1 2 
 scissors clipping

that bad  miss 
there must be something
you like about  im 
yes  his absence 
the man of my dreams

the one i have created
in my mind 
the sort of man   
each woman dreams of
in the deepest   
and most secret reaches
of her heart 
i can almost
see him now before me 
what would i say to him   
if he were really here 
 forgive me   
i ve never known
this feeling 
i ve lived without it
all my life 
is it any wonder  then 
i failed to recognize you 
you ve   
brought it to me
forthe first time 
is there any way that  
that i can tell you
how my life has changed 
any way at all
to let you know   
what sweetness
you have given me 
there is so much to say  i  
i cannot find the words 
except forthese 
i love you 
and such would i say to him 
if he were really here

the riches oflife

an old song say s it best 
  laughter  applause  
do you have any notion
how many years   
i have been
with miss mckenna 
since march of 1 903 
march  1903 
that s correct 
she was 16
at the time 
there she was
on that dingy  stage   
in that pathetic play 
total radiance 
it only took seconds
for me to realize   
exactly what
she had to be 
mrs  robinson 
do you actually believe   
that i have nurtured her 
cared for her 
molded  taught 
developed her
for all these years 
merely to groom
a wife 
what  then 
a star 
only  someone with   
the limited awareness
ofyour age   
could possibly conceive
that my entire passion
for this woman   
is no more than physical 
are you incapable
ofunderstanding that   
she has it within herself
to be one of the greatest 
if not the greatest   
actress
of her generation 
i owe you an apology 
what 
i understand you now 
you have nothing but the best
motives in mind for her 
  and you  
  but so do i 
ofcourse 
she ll continue to act 
she will continue to grow   
and she will become
everything you want her to be 
with you at her side 
yes 
with me at her side 
never 
my god 
you really think
you own her  don t you 
collier  i know
who you are 
ever since
you came here 
i ve known
from the start 
you came
to destroy her 
god  you re
out ofyour mind

mr  collier has left 
that s all 
what do you mean 
gone    from the hotel   
and your life 
i don t believe you 
i must admit 
he was somewhat
more charming   
than others that
we ve encountered in the past 
you and i 
a trifle more sincere 
perhaps  still  
then he was not
the one you spoke of 
no 
then  you were wrong
about him  weren  t  you 
you were wrong 
i love him 
and he s going
to make me very happy 
do  you understand 
i love him 
what difference   
can that make now 
he s gone 
i ll find him  william
