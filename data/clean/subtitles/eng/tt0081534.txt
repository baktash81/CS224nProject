whispers
oh my god
richard one of
the most revered actresses
on the american stage
for manyyears she was
the theaters greatest
box office draw
under the guidance
ofher manager
william fawcett robinson
elise mckenna was the first
american actress to create
a mystique in the publics eye
never seen in public
in her lateryears
apparently without
an offstage life
the absolute quintessence
ofseclusion
excuse me do you have
any theater biographies
that arent in the racks
under the rare books
or magazines
well we do have
some magazines
but theyre in the back
and id have to find them
and
oh could you do that
for me please
well all right
thanks
im in the back
okay
great
here you are
oh thank you
thank you
mmhmm
yes
uh hello yes
mmiss roberts
yes
hi uh my names
richard collier
and i just read your book
on famous american actresses
and i really enjoyed it a lot
what is it you want
information
about elise mckenna
what sort
of information
well im a playwright
and i was thinking about
doing a play based on her life
and of course
id have to talk
im sorry
maam please
please dont
this is not for a play
miss roberts
this is something
very personal
i dont understand
where did you get that
she gave it to me maam
at the opening night
of a play that i wrote
at millfield college
about eight years ago
that watch was
very precious to her
she never never left it
out of her possession
it disappeared
the night she died
she died that night
wont you come in
please
thank you
i have some things
ive been saving
for the theater collection
that was a costume
from one of the plays
she was in
miss roberts
what was she like
when i knew her
she was kind and thoughtful
but she was just
too much within herself
she she seemed
empty somehow
well she wasnt always
that way was she
oh no not at all
people who knew her
when she was young said
that she was quick and bright
and full of fun
strong willful
not at all the way
she was later
what made her change
i dont know
but the change seems to have
taken place about 1 91 2
aftershe performed
in a play
at the grand hotel
that was her manager
william robinson
was he really as strange
as you seemed to indicate
in the book
there was something strange
about their relationship
oh wow iook at this
hey may i
this is incredible
of course
this guy finney
he was my philosophy teacher
at millfield
really
yeah
she read that book
over and over
she had that made
üü  classical
üü
what is it
thats my favorite music
in the whole world
i dont understand
whats happening
doctor finney
youll have to walk
with me young man
i have another class
whats your name
collier sir richard collier
student
uh yes i was
nine years ago
well i try to make
my classes interesting
but nine years
what can i do foryou
i have a question
foryou sir
shoot
is time travel possible
that is a question
let me tell you something
richard is it
yes sir
i was in venice
in 1 971
i was staying in
a very old hotel
but i mean very old
the structure
the furnishings
everything
the atmosphere was aged
ifyou follow me
and my room i felt
as though it was
a century or more
earlier than 1 971
you understand
yes sir
so in other words then
the location is very important
not all important
but essential
mmhmm
the rest is here
one afternoon i
i was lying down
in that room
all the sights around me
a part of the past
even the sounds
i heard
and i conceived a notion
what i asked myself
ifl attempt
to hypnotize my mind
suggest to it
that it isnt 1971
but 1 571
i closed my eyes
and fed a suggestion
into my brain
its august 1 571
i am in
the hotel del vecchio
i spelled out the details
for myself
and did it
over and over
and again and again
and again
and
well ill never
really know richard
ive never done it since
and im not sure
id want to do it again
i felt exhausted afterwards
completely washed out
and if it really
did happen
i was only there a fraction
of an instant remember
a flicker
yes sir i understand that
but you were there
i thought so
oh it wasnt perfect granted
how would it be otherwise
there were objects around me
that were clearly
from the present
and i knew they were there
oh if i were going to
try it again
m i nd you
i have no such i ntention
but if i did
i would disassociate myself
entirely from the present
move everything out ofsight
that could possibly
remind me ofit
then who knows
whoops
sorry hey
hi
hi how do you do
listen do you have 1 9 1 2 money
i mean very specifically 1 9 1 2

this feeling
ive lived without it
all my life
is it any wonder then
i failed to recognize you
youve
brought it to me
forthe first time
is there any way that
that i can tell you
how my life has changed
any way at all
to let you know
what sweetness
you have given me
there is so much to say i
i cannot find the words
except forthese
i love you
and such would i say to him
if he were really here
applause
applause cheering
applause continues
what in gods name
were you doing
murmuring

actor
i say i shall have her
laughter
actress
not in my life
you shall not
man
mr collier
i am the one who loves her
for you
actress
neither do  you
actor 1
i can provide her
with lifes enrichments
rather than
the riches oflife
laughter
actor 2
are  you sure
actor 1
an old song says it best
laughter applause
do you have any notion
how many years
i have been
with miss mckenna
since march of 1 903
march 1903
thats correct
she was 16
at the time
there she was
on that dingy stage
in that pathetic play
total radiance
it only took seconds
for me to realize
exactly what
she had to be
mrs robinson
do you actually believe
that i have nurtured her
cared for her
molded taught
developed her
for all these years
merely to groom
a wife
what then
a star
only someone with
the limited awareness
ofyour age
could possibly conceive
that my entire passion
for this woman
is no more than physical
are you incapable
ofunderstanding that
she has it within herself
to be one of the greatest
if not the greatest
actress
of her generation
i owe you an apology
what
i understand you now
you have nothing but the best
motives in mind for her
and you
but so do i
ofcourse
shell continue to act
she will continue to grow
and she will become
everything you want her to be
with you at her side
yes
with me at her side
never
my god
you really think
you own her dont you
collier i know
who you are
ever since
you came here
ive known
from the start
you came
to destroy her
god youre
out ofyour mind

no sense at all
what could have happened
to him
marie
marie help me

your performance
in act one i
i must say
was somewhat eccentric
where is he
what have you done to him
ive done nothing mckenna
mr collier has left
thats all
what do you mean
gone from the hotel
and your life
i dont believe you
i must admit
he was somewhat
more charming
than others that
weve encountered in the past
you and i
a trifle more sincere
perhaps still
then he was not
the one you spoke of
no
then  you were wrong
about him weren t  you
you were wrong
i love him
and hes going
to make me very happy
do  you understand
i love him
what difference
can that make now
hes gone
ill find him william

while i change

that we leave
within the hour
