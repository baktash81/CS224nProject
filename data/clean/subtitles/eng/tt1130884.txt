get it together 
it s just water 
it s a lot of water
come on 
  you okay boss 
 yeah  i m just   i just can t
i just can not stand on water 
  you re my new partner 
  that s right 
not the best way to know you
half head in the toilet 
doesn t exactly square with
teddy daniels  the man of legend  i ll give you that
the legend 
what the hell are you boys smoking
out there in portland anyway 
seatle 
i came from the office in seatle 
how long have you been with marshals 
four years 
so you know how small it is
what about you  got a girl  married 
i was 
she died 
  jesus    boss  i didn t   
  don t worry  
there was a fire in our apartment
building  while i was out
four people died 
it was the smoke that got her
not the fire
  that s important 
  i m sorry 
where are my goddamn cigars 
i have  have one of mine
i could swear that i have the clothes
when i boarded 
government employees  rob you blind
thanks
have you received any briefing
about the institution befor you left 
all i know is it s a mental hospital
for the criminally insane 
well  if it was just folks hearing voices
and chasing butterflies  i guess
they wouldn t need us
  that s where we re headed 
  yap 
the other side of the island is rock bluffs
all to ended in water
the dock  it s the
only way on  or off
we will casting off again as soon as
you two are ashore
i d appreciate if you two hurry about it
  why 
  storm s coming 
i ve never seen a marshal
badge before 
i m deputy warden
mcpherson  gentlemen 
welcome to shutter island 
i ll be taking you up to ashecliffe 
your boys seem a little on edge
mr mcpherson
right now  marshal  we all are
 remember us for we too have
lived  loved and laughed 
electrified perimeter 
how you know 
i ve seen something like it before 
all right  you gentelman will be accorded
all the help we can offer 
but during the stay you will
obey protocol  do you understand 
absolutely 
the red brick bulding on my right
is ward a  the male ward
ward b the female ward  is one
on the left
ward c is that building on the bluffs
the most dangerous patients
are there
admittance to ward c is forbidden without
the written consent and
physical presence of both myself and dr cawly
is that understood 
you act like insanity is catching
you are hereby required to surrending
your firearms
mr mcpherson  we are duly apointed
federal marshals
we are required to carry our
firearms at all times
executive order 319 of the fedral code of
penitentiaries states that
when stays at penitentiaries
the office head of institutions
has the final authority 
gentlemen  you will not be allowed
to pass through the gate with your firearms
ok  well that does for the official stuff 
come on boys
what do you say we go find dr cawley 
so when did she escaped  the prisoner 
i m afraid that dr  cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation
protocol 
correctional officers at a mental institution
that s a weired sight 
if you don t mind me saying
it s the only pursuit of it s kind in the u s
even in the world  we care
only the most periculo and patients 
most of the other hospitals can not deal 
and all because of dr  cawley 
it created something really unique here 
hospital  people who deal    
id s  gentlemen 
badges  gentlemen 
dr  cawley s been consulted
numerous times
  by scotland yard  mi 5  oss    
  why 
what do you mean 
why the intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychatrist about 
i guess you ll have to ask him
   marshall daniels 
  i am ted 
marshall aule 
  thanl you deputy warden  that will be all
  yes  sir 
pleasure  gentlemen 
he sure had a lot to say about you
mcpherson is a good man 
he believe in the work they do here 
and what would that be exactly 
a moral fusion between law and
order and clinical care
pardon me dr   
a waht between what and what 
these paintings are quite accurate 
it used to be that kind of patients we
deal with here
shackled and left in their own filth
they were beaten
as they put bloody
drove screws into their brain  and submerged them into icy water to lose their consciousness
or even drown 
  and now 
  we treat them 
trying to heal  to cure 
and if this fails  we at least provide them
with a measure of calm in their lives 
these are    
all violent offenders  right 
they ve hurt people 
  murdered them in some cases 
  in almost all cases  yes 
then personally doctor  i d have to
say    screw their sense of calm 
it s my job to treat my patients not theire victims  i m not here to judge 
  so this female prisoner    
  patient 
excuse me  patient 
one solando rachel 
  escaped sometime in the last 24 hours 
  last night 
between 10 and midnight
  is she considered dangerous 
  you could say that 
she killed all three of her children 
she drowned them in the lake behind the house 
she took them out one by one and held their
head in water until drowned 
thenshe brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table
and ate a meal
before a neighbor dropped by 
what about her husband 
he died  on the beaches of normandy 
she is a poor widow 
she starved herself when first she came here
she insist the children weren t dead
  sorry dr wouldn t happen to have some aspirin 
   prone to headaches marshal
sometimes  but today    
  more prone to seasickness 
 ah  dehydration    
  you allright boss 
  yes 
in that case you re quite right
simpler the better 
thank you so much
rachel still believe
her children are alived 
also thought that this is her home
of berckshires 
you are kidding 
in four years acknowldge
that she is in an institution
she believe we re all    
deliveryman milkman  postal workers 
to sustain the illusion that her children never died
she created an elaborate fictional structure
she gives us all parts to play in that fiction
  so you searched the ground yet 
  the warden and his man scoured the island 
not a trace 
what s more disturbing  is that we don t know
how she got out of her room 
it was locked from the outside
and the only window is barred 
it s as if she evaporated straight
through the walls 
brought her right back here after
group therapy  locked her in
i came back for midnight rounde
and she was gone
seriously doctor  how is it possible
the truth never gets through her 
ie  in an institution
mental illness  right 
seems like something you de
notice from time to time
  how many pairs of shoes get patientsi 
  two pairs 
sanity is not a choice  marshal 
you can t just choode to get over it
so     she left here barefoot 
come on doc  she can t get ten
yard in this terrain 
marshall 
  the law of 4 
who s 67  
that s definitely rachel s
handwriting
i have no idea what the   law of 4  is  though
  not a psychiatric term 
i m afraid not 
who s 67 
fuck if i know 
i de have to say that s quite
close to my clinical conclusion
so you think it s just
random scribblings 
no  not at all  rachel is smart  
brilliant in fact 
  this paper that could be important 
  excuse me doctor  but    
  we need to hold onto this 
  of course
the departure had to come through here 
after lights out  the orderlies play
card in here
last night there were 7 man sitting
at the base of the atairs playing stud poker
and yet somehow  rachel has managed
to slip by 
why 
how  she turns invisible 
doctor  we need access to personal files
of all medical staff
of nurses  guards  orderlies
  everyone who worked here 
  we take your request under consideration 
this is not a request  doctor 
this is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner    
  patient 
  patient    
  has escaped now  you can comply    
  all i can say is that i will see what i can do 
doctor  we ll need to speak with the staff 
do you understand 
i ll assemble them in the
common room after dinner 
if you have any further questions
feel free to join the dwputy warden in the search
it s 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water is freesing
the current was strong last night 
the tide pushing in
she s have drowned or been crushed on
the rocks  her body would have washed back onshore 
those caves down ther 
have you checked them 
no way she could get there 
the base of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy  live oak  sumac
and a thousand plants with thorns
as big as my dick 
you said it yourself marshall 
she s got no shoes
all right  boys 
let s check the other side 
  what s that tower 
  an old lighthouse 
the quards already searching inside it 
  what s in there  more patients 
  sewage treatment facility 
it will be dark soon 
i m calling this off for the night
let s go  boys 
  you were watching the land  right 
  yes 
can t no one get in or out of their room
in that corridor without me seeing
all right  rachel solando 
who else does she had to pass
to get down here 
me 
glen miga 
  sir  i saw nothing 
  and you were at your post all night 
yes  but i saw nothing 
glen 
glen 
tell me the truth 
i m really     went to the bathroom 
  what  you breached protocols  christ    
  i was away only one minutes 
all right  i do not know what to expect here 
let s back up 
mrs  solando was put in her room for lights out 
does anybody knows what did she do
before taht 
anyone 
come on  anyone  anyone anyone
she was in a group therapy session
did anything unusual occur 
defines  unusual  
  excuse me 
  it s a mental institution  marshall 
for criminally insane 
 usual   isn t a big part of our day 
i will rephrase 
did anything happened last night
during and group therapy  that was more   
  let s say  more memorable than    
  normal 
exactly 
no  i m sorry 
did mrs  solando said anything
during group therapy 
she was worried about the rain 
and she hates the food here 
complained constantly 
last night including
so     you were there
in the presence of a doctor 
dr  sheehan led discuses 
dr  sheehan 
yes  he was running the session 
he s rachels s  primary 
the psychaiatrist who directly
oversees her care 
we ll need to speak with dr  sheehan 
i m afraid that won t be possible 
he left on the ferry in this morning
his vacation was already planned 
he d putting it off too long
you re in a state of lockdown 
a dangerous patient has escaped
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation 
of course  he s a doctor
do you have the phone number for
where he s gone 
hello  hello 
hello 
is anyone there 
i m sorry sir  but it all down 
all the lines 
the storm s hitting the
mainland as a hammer 
if you get it working come find me immediately 
the marshalls need to make an important call
yes  sir 
i m afraid i have evening rounds in the wards 
but i ll be having drinks and a cigar at
my house around 9
if you like to drop by
good  we can talk then  right 
we have been talking  marshall 
gotta say  i m thinking i went
into the wrong line of public service
it is a little overwhelming 
it was constructed during the civil war
the same time as the military fort
houses  ward c
this building is the original commander s quarters
it cost a fortune when uncle sam got the bill
the commander was courtmartialed
i can see why
nice music  who s that  brahms 
no 
it s mahler 
quite right  marshall 
forgive me  gentlemen    
my colleague  dr  jeremiah naehring 
quartet for piano and strings
in a minor 
 your poison  gentlemen 
  rye  if you ve got it 
soda and ice please  thanks
you don t indulge in alcohol 
i am surprised 
isn t it common for men in your
profession to imbibe 
common enough 
and yours 
  i m sorry 
  your profession  doctor psychiatry    
i ve always heared it s overrun
with booceys and drunks
not that i ve noticed 
what s it  cold tea in your glass 
excellent marshall 
you have outstanding defense mechanism 
you must be quite adapt at interrogation 
men like you     are my specialty 
men of violence 
that s a hell of assumption to make   
no assumption  not at all  you misunderstand me 
i said you are men of violence
i m not accusing you of being violent man
it s quite different
please  please  edify us  doc 
you both served overseas
not much of a stretch  doc  for all you know 
we were both paper pushers over there
no  you were not 
since the schoolyard  i would bet neither
of you has ever walked away from a physical conflict
not to suggest you enjoy it
but because retreat wasn t something you considered an option
wasn t raised to run doc
ah  yes    raised
and who raised you  marshall 
me 
wolves 
very impressive defense mechanism 
do you believe in god  marshall 
i m quite serious
that s rubbish 
have you ever seen     a death camp  doctor 
i have  i was there  for the liberation of daqhau
your english is very good  almost clawless
your english is very good 
you hit the consonants a tad hard  though
you re german 
 is legal immigration a crime  marshall 
  oh i don t know doctor  you to tell us 
listen  we need the files of sheehan
and on the rest of staff as well
no such file will be released for you 
period 
  we gonna need those files 
  out of the question 
bullshit  there is no question 
bullshit 
anyway  who is in charge here  huh 
dr naehring is the liaison to
our board of overseas 
he relayed your request and it s been refused 
refused  they don t have the authority to refuse  and neither you  sir 
marshall  continues your investigation
and we will do all we can to help 
this investigation is over 
we will file our reports
and handle it over    
  hoover s boys 
  hoover s boys  that s right 
we ll take the ferry back in the morning 
come on  chuck
nice night 
you re bunking in the orderlies quarter 
hey boss      we really gonna pack it in 
why 
i guess  i dunno  i just   
never quit anything before 
we haven t heared the truth once yet chuck
rachel solando did not slipped out of
a locked room barefoot without any help 
i m beginning to think alot of help
maybe cawley sitting up in his mansion
right now 
rethinking his whole attitudes
  maybe in the morning   
  you re bluffing 
i didn t said that 
i found a whole stock of these  teddy 
jesus  are you ever sober anymore 
i killed alot of people in the war 
is that why you drink 
are you real 
no 
she s still here 
who 
rachel 
she never left 
remember when we stayed at the cabin
by the lake  
we were so happy
she s here 
you can t leave
i m not gonna leave 
i love you so much 
  i am the bones in a box  teddy 
  no 
i am
you have to wake up 
i won t go 
you re here 
i m not 
you have to face that 
but she is
and so is he
who 
laeddis 
i have to go 
no  please    don t
 just a little longer 
  oh  teddy    
let me go 
i can not 
ain t gonna be no ferry in this shit
doctor 
doctor  doctor 
we need to interview the patients who
were in rachel s group therapy that night
i thought your investigation was finished 
it s not like we can take the ferry
and was rachel recieving any
other treatment for her illnesses 
do you know what the state of
mental health field in these days  gentelmen 
no  we are not doctors 
war 
the old schools believes in
surgical interventions
psychosurgery 
the procedures are that the orbital lobotomy 
some say that patientsi are reasonable 
other essential say become zombies 
  and the new school 
  psycho pharmacology 
a new drug has just been approved
of autorities 
that relaxes psychotic patients
some would say tames then
  and which school are you in  doc 
  i 
i have this radical idea that if you treat a
patient with respect
and listen to him
trying to understand 
you just might reach him 
  these pacients 
  my point is 
what should be the last resort 
becomes the first response 
give them a pill and put them in a corner 
and it all goes away 
rachel solando was a on a combination of drugs
meant to keep her from becoming violent
and it was only intermittently effective
the greatest obstacle to her recovery was
her refusal to face what she had done
 was  
is there a reason why you refer to
your patint in the past tense doctor 
look outside  marshall 
why do you think 
next one is peter breen  assaulted
his father s nurse with a brocken glass 
nurse survived  but
her face permaanently disfigured
i can t wait 
she smiles at me 
she was so sweet
but     i could read in his eyes 
she liked to be naked 
liked to suck cock
all right  mr breen 
and asked me if she can have
a glass of water
alone in the kitchen 
like that s no big deal 
  why was that a big deal 
   it was obvious 
she wanted me to pull out my thing so she
could laugh at it
mr breen 
we need to ask you some questions  okay 
when i cut her she screamed
but    
she scared me 
what did she expect 
interesting 
but we are here to talk
rachel solando  ok 
rachel solando    
did you know she had drown her own kids 
she drowned her kids
this is a sick fucking world
we live in  i ll tell you that    
they should be gassed
all of them    the retards  killers
the niggers  kill your own kids 
gas the bitch
please   stop that 
  a nurse 
  please  stop that 
a nurse maybe  maybe she had kids 
a husband    
trying to make ends meet 
to have a normal life    
assisting your father                
you tore her face off  didn t you
congratulations  no more normal
for her  not ever again
do you know what she was afraid of 
you 
could you stop that  please 
stop that 
please     stops 
  you know a patient by the name andrew laeddis 
  no  no 
i want to go back 
i ll never get out of here 
i m not sure i should
excuse me for saying it 
  miss kearns    
  god 
mrs  kearns 
but you seem     
quite normal     
i mean in comparison
with the other patients here
well  i have my dark days
i suppose everyone does
differents is that most people don t kill
their husbands with an axe
although personally i think if a
man beats you and fuck
half the women he sees
and no one will help you
axing him isn t the least understandable
thing you can do
maybe you shouldn t get out 
and what would i do if i did 
i don t know the world anymore 
they say there are
bombs that can turn whole
cities to ash
and what do they call  television     
voices and faces coming from a box
i hear enough voices already
what can you tell us about rachel 
no much  she    she keep to herself
she believes her kids were alive
she thought she was still living
in berkshire and we were all neighbours
  milkman  postman
  deliveryman 
dr sheehan was there that night 
yes 
he talked about anger 
tell me about him    
what s he like 
i think e    
ok    nice
not hard on the eyes
just my mother would say
did he ever come passing you 
no 
no  dr  sheehan is a good doctor  he wouldn t    
could i have a glass of water  please 
no problem 
thank you  marshall 
i have just one more question
mrs  kearns 
did you ever meet a patient
named andrew laeddis 
no 
never heard of him 
she was coached
he used the same words as
cawley s and the nurse 
  it s like she d been told exactly what to say 
  who is andrew laeddis 
you asked every one of those patients
about him  who s he 
what the hell  boss  i m your partner
for the god s sake 
we just met  chuck 
there are the job long 
you got a duty  a career
and what i m doing
not exactly by the book 
i don t give a damn about the book  boss
but i need to know what the hell is going on
when this case came over the wires 
  i requested it  specifically  do you understand 
  why 
andrew laeddis 
was the maintenance man in thr apartment
building where my wife and i lived
okay 
he was also a firebug 
andrew laeddis lit the match 
that caused the fire that killed my wife 
open the 
what happened with laeddis 
got away 
laeddis got away and disappeared 
about a year ago i opened the
newspaper and there he is 
he s an ugly son of a bitch 
he had a new scar in the right temple
down to his left lip 
eyes different colors 
not a type of face you forget 
he d burned a schoolhouse  killed 2 people 
he said voices told him to do that 
first he was sent to prison
and then he was transferred here 
  then what 
  then  nothing 
he vanished like he never existed
no records forever
i m sure he s not in ward b
that leaves ward c 
or he could be dead 
so could rachel solando 
lots of places to hide a body here
only one place where
no one really knows
the patient   bridget kearne 
when she sent me for water 
she said something back to you  didn t she 
no 
come on boss 
she wrote it 
  run   
boss 
we must get inside  it s turning
into fucking kansas out here   
all right  now 
let s go 
watch out 
jesus 
come on  let s go back 
jesus christ 
damn it 
  are you okay boss 
  yes  that s all right 
so     you think laeddis is here    
what are you going to do boss 
i m not here to kill leaddis 
if it were my wife
i d kill him twice 
when we got through the gates of dachau 
the ss guards surrendered 
the commander tried to kill himself
before we got there    
but he botched it
took him an hour to die
when i went outside 
i saw bodies on the ground 
too many to count
too many to imagine 
so yeah
the guards surrendered  we took 
their guns  lined them up    
i wasn t warfair 
it was murder 
i m tired of killing 
that s not why i m here
so what is it all about 
after laeddis vanished 
i started doing some checking
on ashecliffe 
lot of people knew about this place  but no
one wants to talk    
like they re scared of something
you know this place is funded by
special grants
from the house of
american activities committee  
great  and how exactly are we fighting
the countries from an island in boston harbor 
by conducting experiments on the mind
at least that s my guess
and you think thats going on in here 
as i said  nobody s talking  right 
until i found someone
who used to be a patient here 
guy s name george noyce 
nice college kid 
socialist 
he got an offer to get some money for some psych study  guess what they were testing 
  drug tests 
  he started seeing dragons everywhere 
almost beat his proffesor to death
end up appearing in ashecliffe 
ward c 
they released him after 1 year  right 
what does he do 
two weeks on a mainland
he walks into a bar and stabs three men to death
his lawyer pleads insanity 
but noyce    
stands up in the courtroom and
he begs the judge 
for the electric chair 
anywhere but not a
mental hospital 
judge give him life in the dedham prison 
  and you have you found him 
  yes  i ve found him 
he s a mess
but it is pretty clear from what he tells me 
they re experimenting on people here 
i do not know  boss 
  i don not believe a crazy
  that s the beauty of it 
crazy people are a perfect subject 
they talk  but nobody listened 
i stood in dachau 
we saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other  right 
for christ sake we fought a goddamn war
to stop them 
and now find out it may be happening here 
on our land 
no 
what are you really here to do  teddy 
i m here to get the proof 
i m gonna go back and blow
the lid off this place 
that s it
wait a minute 
you started asking around about ashecliffe 
waiting for a chance to get out here
then suddenly they need a us marshall 
i got lucky  a patient escaped  
it was the perfect excuse 
no  no  no boss 
luck doesn t work that way 
the world doesn t work that way 
they got electric fence around a septic facility 
ward c is inside a civil war fort 
a chief of staff with ties to the ss
funding from huac 
jesus christ  everything in this place
stinks   government ops 
   what if they wanted you here 
  bullshit 
  ask questions 
  nonsense 
bullshit  where is rachel soalndo 
where is one shred of evidence that she even existed 
i had to know where
that will give me any  in any case             
while you were looking at that neighbourhood 
they re looking at you
all they need to do
is making a fake escape to get you here
and now they have you 
they have us both here  now 
marshall  are you here  
 please signal us  this is deputy warden mcpherson 
marshall  
how about that  they found us 
it s an island  boss  they ll always find us 
  i know you are in there    
we get out of this fucking island 
you and me 
come on 
  come on 
  go 
get dry off
dr  cawley wants to talk to you  now 
and hurry up  this thing is transforming
to a goddamn hurricane 
i dopped those suits to be cleaned 
it should be ready by tomorrow 
if we don t all wash away first
speaking of which  i m afraid your smoke were
pretty much done for
so    
it s our only choice  right 
that s something really nice in prison already
that                    
now that you mention it  it is just fine 
that s why i must repeat my insistence
that all ward c patients
be placed in manual restrains 
if the facility floods  they ll drown
you know that
  that would take a lot of flooding 
  we are on an island 
in the middle of the ocean 
during a hurricane 
a lot of flooding seems like a
distinct possibility
it s a gamble  steven 
say the power fails
there s a backup generators 
and if htat goes  the cell doors
will open
where are they to go 
they can t just hop a ferry  scoot over
to the mainland over a weak havoc 
you re right  probably responsible
recovery right here on us  
if they re manacled to the floor  they die
24 human beings 
you can t live with that  can you 
frankly  if it were up to me
  i d put all 42 in ward a and b in
manual restrains as well
excuse me
excuse me
  marshall 
  i m sorry  i have one quick question 
yes  i will be with you in a moment 
when we spoke this morning about rachel solando s note
the law of 4  i loved that 
you told me you had no idea what
that second line could refer to
who s 67 
yes  i m afraid i still do not know 
none of us knows 
nothing comes to mind 
nothing 
because i believed i just heard
you say that there are
24 patients in ward c 
and 42 of patients  in wards a and b
which would mean there are

this island 
dolores 
he s not in this ward 
he was transferred    
out of here 
if he s not in ward a
there s only one place he can be
the lighthouse 
hey 
god help you 
boss  we have problems 
cawley and mcpherson are in the building 
cawley heard an orderly went batshit on a patient 
then got sent up to the roof 
he went up to look for him
let s get the hell out of here 
this way
just keep going 
we belong here
  what happened to you 
  what do you mean 
where were you 
after we got that guy to the infirmary 
i took a little detect
to patient records 
did you find laeddis 
no 
  i didn t find him 
  i find next best thing 
in his intake form 
that s all that was in his file
no session note  no incident reports
no photograph    just this 
it was weired
here  take a look 
i ll take a look later 
what s the matter boss 
i ll look at it later 
that s all 
ashecliffe s that way 
i m not going to ashecliffe 
i m going to the lighthouse 
i m going to find out what
the fuck is hapening in thid island 
here it is 
damn 
too far north
we ll have to double back
there s no way to cros those rocks
there could be a way behind those trees
maybe a path that goes around the rocks
to the lighthouse
what are we doing here 
we ve get the intake form
it proofs ther s a 67th patient   
who they ve said repeatedly he doesn t exist
i m getting to that lighthouse
do you understand 
what can i say to you stop 
why would you want to 
because climbing down there
when it s dark           suicide
okay 
maybe it s better you sit this one out
you brought me into this  boss 
and now i am trapped on this rock 
on the island 
without anyone we know 
and now you acting like          
like what 
how my acting 
what the hell happened
in those cells  ted 
  what do you think weather is like in portland  chuck 
  i m from seattle 
seattle 
i ll go alone    alone
come with you  partner 
i said alone
fine 
damn it 
damn it 
i knew it will take long 
but i couldn t get there because tide is on
chuck 
chuck 
come on 
chuck 
where are you  chuck 
chuck 
chuck 
who are you 
i am teddy daniels 
i m a cop 
you re a marshal 
that s right 
would you mind mind    
take your hands from behind
your back 
why 
why 
to make sure what you
have hold there does not hurt me
i m gonna keep this   
if you do not mind 
fine with me 
you re rachel solando 
the real one 
did you kill your children 
i never had children 
i was never married 
before i be a patient
in ashecliff  i worked here 
you were a nurse 
i was a doctor  marshall 
you think i m crazy 
  no  i    
  and if i say i m not crazy    
well that hardly helps  does it 
that s the kafkaesque genius of it 
people always tell you you re crazy
and protested  on the contrary 
confirm what they say 
i do not following you 
i m sorry 
once you are declared insane 
then anything you do is called
as a part of insanity 
your reasonable protests
or denial  
valid fears 
paranoia 
survival instincts
as defense mechanisms 
you re smarter than you look marshall
that s probably not a good thing
tell me something    
yes    
what happened to you 
i started asking about shipping this
this large amount of sodium  
  and the sodium based hallucinogens 
  psychotropic drugs 
and i began to ask about the surgeries  too
ever heard of transorbital lobotomy 
they cap the patient with electroshocks 
then go through the eye with an ice pick
and pull out some nerve fibers
makes the patient more obedient 
tractable
it s barbaric 
unconscionable
do you know how pain enters the
body marshal  do you 
depends on where you hurt 
no  it has nothing to the flesh
the brain controls pain 
the brain controls fear  empathy 
sleep  anger  hunger     everything 
what if you could control it 
the brain 
to re create a man 
so he doesn t feel pain
or love  or sympathy 
a man who can t be interrogated
because he has no memories to confess
they can never takes
all men memories
never 
and you know the north koreans
use american pows
during brainwashing experiments
they turns soldiers into traitors 
that s what they are doing here 
creates ghosts and give way in the world 
and do things sane man never do 
that kind of ability  that kind of knowledge
it would take years 
years of research 
experiments on hundreds of patients 
for 50 years now 
people will look back
and they say     this place
is where it all began 
the nazis used the jews
the soviets
used prisoners in their own gulags
and we   
we tested patients 
on shutter island 
no  they won t    
no
you do understand
that they can t let you leave 
i m a federal marshall    
they can t stop me 
i was a esteemed psychiatrist 
from a respected family 
it did not matter 
let me ask you    
any past trauma in your life 
yes  why    why that matter 
if a particular event is past
the reason you lost your sanity      
so when they commit you in here
your friends  colleagues will say   
he has cracked 
and who would do it 
after what happened 
that could be said of anyone
  anyone at all 
  the point is they re going to say it about you 
how s your head 
  my head 
  you had funny dreams 
trouble sleeping  headaches    
i m prone to migraine
jesus 
you haven t taken any pills  no 
  not even aspire 
  i get a aspirin 
jesus 
and you ate in the canteen and of drinking
coffee that gave it 
tell me that even
smoking cigars of you 
not     no 
i haven t 
it takes between 36 and 48 hours for
neuroleptics narcotics    
to reach sufficient blood
that you and take effect 
pulse will become first
fingers first and then
shall include all labor 
seen any waking nightmares lately 
marshall 
tell me what s going on in that lighthouse 
tell me 
brain surgery 
like   to open the skull to see
what if we pull on this kind                 
that s not different with nazi s kind
and then they created the ghosts 
who knows about this 
on the islandm i mean  who 
everyone 
come on  the nurses  the orderlies 
  it s not possible    
  everybody 
you can t stay here 
they think i m dead  that i drowned 
if they come looking for you  they might finf me
i m sorry  but you have to go 
i m gonna come back for you 
i will not be here  i move during the day 
new places every night 
but i could come get you
take you out of the island 
haven t you heard a word i ve said 
the only way off the island
is ferry and they control it
you ll never leave here 
i had a friend 
he was with me yesterday 
but we got seperated 
have you seen him 
marshall    
you have no friends 
there you are 
we ve been wondering when
you d show up
take a seat 
come on 
taking a leisurely stroll  were we 
i just   
just looking around 
did you enjoy
god s latest gift 
  what 
  the god s gifts 
the violence 
when i came downstaires in my home
and saw a tree in my living room
it reached for me like a divine hand 
god loves violence 
  i hadn t noticed 
  sure you have 
why else would there be so much of it 
it s in us 
what we are 
we wage war  we burn sacrifices
we pillage and plunder
and treat at the flesh
of our brothers
and why  because god gave us violence
to wage in his honor 
i thought god gave us moral orders 
there is no moral orders
as pure as this storm 
there s no moral order at all 
there s just this 
can my violence conquer yours 
  i m not violent 
  you are 
you re violent as they come 
i know  because i am as violent as they come 
from constructred society
we were lifted              
if i always stood between you and my meal you
would crack my skull with rock and steal my meal
poor you
cawley thinks you re harmless  you can be
controled  but i know are different 
  you don t know me 
  oh but i do 
we ve known each other for centuries 
if i am to send my teeth to sank into your eye
right now 
could you stop me before i blinded you 
give it a try 
that s the spirit 
where have you been 
wandering  just looking at your island 
you ll be leaving 
now that rachel has been found 
sure 
big meeting
oh  yes    
apparently there was an unidentified man
in ward c yesterday
he subdued a very dangerous patient 
quite handly 
even so          
it seems he had a long concersation with a
paranoid schizophrenic  george noyce 
this noyce 
so you said his name was 
  he s delusional  right 
  oh extremely  he can be quite upseting
in fact  two weeks ago  a patient
was so worked up
over one of noyce s stories
that he beat him up 
cigarette 
no  thanks 
i quit 
so  you ll taking the ferry 
absolutely    
i think we ve gotten
all we came here for
 we  marshall 
speaking of a               
  you ve seen him  doctor 
  who 
my partner  chuck 
you don t have a partner  marshall 
you came here alone 
you know  i ve built something valuable here
but valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time
everyone wants a quick fix 
they always have
i m trying to do something that people
that even you don t undersyand
and i m not going to give up
without a fight
i can see that    
so tell me again
about your partner 
what partner 
marshall    
going somewhere 
no  just     take my way
to ferry 
i m afraid it s the other side 
if you wait a moment 
i find someone to take you
to the port 
what is this  doctor 
it s just a sedative 
  it s for precaution 
  precaution 
what are you going to do 
to kill me 
you think you deserve it
for what 
for provoking you 
and forgive me
what doesn t provoke you 
remarks    
  words    
  nazi  
and that too
and of course  memories  dreams    
did you knew that the word  trauma  comes
from a greek word of wound 
and what s the german word for  dream 
is  traumen 
  traumen           
a dream  
wounds can creates monsters 
and you    
you are wounded  marshall 
i think you re agree 
when you see a monster
you must stop it 
  i agree 
  yes    
what are you doing  baby 
you ve got to get to the ferry 
no  not     no 
if the world thinks that chuck is dead 
then he is perfect for their experiments 
only one place they d take him
you go there and you ll die 
he s my partner  if they re hurting him
holding him against his will  i have to bring him out
i can not lose anyone else 
do not go there 
please don  t do this teddy 
i m sorry  honey 
i love this because
you gave it to me
but the truth is    
it s one fucking ugly tie 
no 
do not move 
stay where you are 
are you going to kill me 
no 
i will not kill you 
why are you all wet  baby 
  what did you say 
  you know exactly what i said 
the rifle s empty by the way 
have a seat
for god s sake dry off
you re going to catch cold
all right 
how badly did you hurt the guard 
i do not know what
are you talking about 
yes  he s here 
have dr sheehan take a good look
at your man before you send him up
so  dr  shehan    
he came on the ferry
this morining 
not exactly 
you blew up my car 
i really loved that car 
sorry to hear about that 
tremors are getting pretty bad 
how are the hallucinations 
  go away  teddy                     
  this place is gonna be the end of you   
  not bad 
  they ll get worse 
i know 
dr  solando    
she told me about neuroleptics 
did she now 
and when was this 
i found her doctor in a cave on the cliffs 
but you won t get her 
i don t doubt it 
considerations are not real 
but your hallucinations are
more severe than i thought 
you are not on neuroleptics 
you are not on neuroleptics
as a matter of fact
then what the fuck is this 
huh  what the fuck is this 
withdrawal 
withdrawal 
from what  i haven t even had a goddamned
drink since we got on this island 
chlorpromazine
i m not a fan of pharmacology
but i have to see in your case    
  clorpro     like you said 
  chlorpromazine 
the same thing we ve
been giving you for the last 24 months 
so in the past two years
you have had somebody in boston
who gave me drugs         
not boston 
here 
you ve been here for two years 
a patient of this institutions 
after everythings i see here  doctor 
you really thinks you can
convince me i m crazy 
you know what kind of people we are dealing 
i m u s  marshal
you were a u s  marshal
here s a copy of your intake form
you broke into ward c for 
proof of the 67th patient
if you d gotten to the mainland 
you could have blown the lid off this place 
  wait    wait
  but somehow
and yet you couldn t find time
to look at it yet  read it
go ahead
the patient is highly intelligent
highly delusional 
decorated army veteran 
prisoned for the
liberation of dachav 
former u s  marshal
known proclivity for violence 
shown no remorse for his crime because
his denial is such
that no crime ever took place
highly developed and fantastical
narratives which preclude facing
the truth of his actions   
i am tired of this bullshits 
where s my partner 
where s chuck 
where is he 
let s try this in another way 
your wife s maiden name was
 chana  am i correct 
  not even talk about her 
  i m afraid i have to 
notice anything these four names have in common 
the rule 4 
  andrew  what do you see 
  if you done anything
  to my partner  doctor  it is a violation    
  focus  andrew  what do you see 
the names    
have the same letters 
edward daniels has exactly same
13 letters
as andrew laeddis 
the same as rachel and solando
and dolore chan  all names
  are anagrams of each other 
  tactics of intimidation        
it doesn t work on me 
you came here for the truth 
here it is 
your name is andrew laeddis 
the 67th patient at ashecliffe
is you  andrew 
bullshit
you were committed here by
court order 24 months ago 
your crime s terrible 
one you can t forgieve yourself 
so you invented
another self 
let us return to the facts 
and have created a story in which
you re not a murderer  you are hearless       
you are a u s marshal 
only here in ashkliff
because of a case
and you ve uncovered conspiracy
so that anything we tell you about
who you are  what you ve done
you can dismiss as lies  andrew
my name is edward daniels 
i ve been hearing this fantasy
for two years  i know every details 
patient 67  storm 
rachel solando 
your missing partner
dreams you have every night 
you were at dachave 
but it could not have killed any guards 
i wish i could let you just
live in your fantasy world
i really do 
but are violent  trained  dangerous 
you re the most dangerous patient we have 
you ve injured all of the guards
other patients 
two weeks ago
you attacked george noyce 
i did so something                              
  you have             
  off course i didn t 
give me one reason
why i even touch him 
because he called you laeddis
and you do anything not to be him
i have a transcript of that conversation
you had with noyce yesterday  
this is about you and laeddis
that s all it s ever been about
this says it s about
 me and laeddis  
when you ve asked him what happened
to his face 
said  and i quote again 
 you did it  
  he meant it was my fault he    
  you almost killed him 
the warden and the board of overseas
are determined that something be done it s been decided
nevertheles we can bring you back in sanity now
right now
permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you can t hurt anyone ever again
they lobotomine you  andrew 
do you understand 
yes  i understand 
i understand just fine
if   if i don t play along
with your little game here
dr  naehring will turn me into
one of his ghosts 
what about my partner 
you mean a u s  marshal
is a  defense mechanism 
hey  boss  
what the fuck is going on here 
you re working for him 
i m sorry about that
someone had to stay with you  keep you safe
you ve been watch me  right 
watch me every minute 
who     who are you 
who are you 
tell me 
don t you recognize me  andrew 
i ve been you primary psychiatrist
for the last two years 
i am lester sheehan 
and i told you about my wife    
  i know 
  i climbed a cliff to save you 
i trusted you  i risked
everything  after you  everything 
i know  boss   
we re running out of time here  andrew 
i swore before the entire board of
overseas that i could construct
the most radical  role play
ever in history of psychiatry and
that will bring you back 
i thought if we let you play

she murdered our children 
and she told me to let her go 
  who is teddy daniels 
  he doesn t exist 
neither rachel solando 
i made them up 
why 
we need to hear you say it 
after she trie to kill
her for the first time 
dolores told me that    
she has an insect    
living inside her brain 
she could feel it    
walking cross
her skull    
pulling the wires 
just for fun 
she told me that 
she told me but i didn t listen
i loved her so much 
why did you make them up 
because i can not take knowing
that dolores killed our children 
i killed them  because
i didn t get her some help 
i killed them   
here s my theory  andrew 
we broke through once before 
nine months ago 
and then you regressed 
  i do not remember that 
  i know 
you reset  andrew 
like a tape
playing over and over on an endless loop
i hope that what we ve done will be enough
to stop it from happening again
i need to know    
that you have accepted the reality 
you came after me  doctor 
you tried to help me when no one else would
my name is andrew laeddis    
and i murdered my wife
in the spring of 1952 
how we doing this morning

chuck 
back to the mainland  whatever the
hell is going on here is bad
