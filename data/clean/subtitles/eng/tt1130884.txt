yeah im justi just cant
i just can not stand on water
youre my new partner
thats right
not the best way to know you
half head in the toilet
doesnt exactly square with
teddy daniels the man of legend ill give you that
the legend
what the hell are you boys smoking
out there in portland anyway
seatle
i came from the office in seatle
how long have you been with marshals
four years
so you know how small it is
what about you got a girl married
i was
she died
jesus boss i didnt
dont worry
there was a fire in our apartment
building while i was out
four people died
it was the smoke that got her
not the fire
thats important
im sorry
where are my goddamn cigars
i have have one of mine
i could swear that i have the clothes
when i boarded
government employees rob you blind
thanks
have you received any briefing
about the institution befor you left
all i know is its a mental hospital
for the criminally insane
well if it was just folks hearing voices
and chasing butterflies i guess
they wouldnt need us
thats where were headed
yap
the other side of the island is rock bluffs
all to ended in water
the dock its the
only way on or off
we will casting off again as soon as
you two are ashore
id appreciate if you two hurry about it
why
storms coming
ive never seen a marshal
badge before
im deputy warden
mcpherson gentlemen
welcome to shutter island
ill be taking you up to ashecliffe
your boys seem a little on edge
mr mcpherson
right now marshal we all are
remember us for we too have
lived loved and laughed
electrified perimeter
how you know
ive seen something like it before
all right you gentelman will be accorded
all the help we can offer
but during the stay you will
obey protocol do you understand
absolutely
the red brick bulding on my right
is ward a the male ward
ward b the female ward is one
on the left
ward c is that building on the bluffs
the most dangerous patients
are there
admittance to ward c is forbidden without
the written consent and
physical presence of both myself and drcawly
is that understood
you act like insanity is catching
you are hereby required to surrending
your firearms
mr mcpherson we are duly apointed
federal marshals
we are required to carry our
firearms at all times
executive order 319 of the fedral code of
penitentiaries states that
when stays at penitentiaries
the office head of institutions
has the final authority
gentlemen you will not be allowed
to pass through the gate with your firearms
ok well that does for the official stuff
come on boys
what do you say we go find drcawley
so when did she escaped the prisoner
im afraid that dr cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation
protocol
correctional officers at a mental institution
thats a weired sight
if you dont mind me saying
its the only pursuit of its kind in the us
even in the world we care
only the most periculo and patients
most of the other hospitals can not deal
and all because of dr cawley
it created something really unique here
hospital people who deal
ids gentlemen
badges gentlemen
dr cawleys been consulted
numerous times
by scotland yard mi 5 oss
why
what do you mean
why the intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychatrist about
i guess youll have to ask him
marshall daniels
i am ted
marshall aule
thanl you deputy warden that will be all
yes sir
pleasure gentlemen
he sure had a lot to say about you
mcpherson is a good man
he believe in the work they do here
and what would that be exactly
a moral fusion between law and
order and clinical care
pardon me dr
a waht between what and what
these paintings are quite accurate
it used to be that kind of patients we
deal with here
shackled and left in their own filth
they were beaten
as they put bloody
drove screws into their brain and submerged them into icy water to lose their consciousness
or even drown
and now
we treat them
trying to heal to cure
and if this fails we at least provide them
with a measure of calm in their lives
these are
all violent offenders right
theyve hurt people
murdered them in some cases
in almost all cases yes
then personally doctor id have to
say screw their sense of calm
its my job to treat my patients not theire victims im not here to judge
so this female prisoner
patient
excuse me patient
one solando rachel
escaped sometime in the last 24 hours
last night
between 10 and midnight
is she considered dangerous
you could say that
she killed all three of her children
she drowned them in the lake behind the house
she took them out one by one and held their
head in water until drowned
thenshe brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table
and ate a meal
before a neighbor dropped by
what about her husband
he died on the beaches of normandy
she is a poor widow
she starved herself when first she came here
she insist the children werent dead
sorry dr wouldnt happen to have some aspirin
prone to headaches marshal
sometimes but today
more prone to seasickness
ah dehydration
you allright boss
yes
in that case youre quite right
simpler the better
thank you so much
rachel still believe
her children are alived
also thought that this is her home
of berckshires
you are kidding
in four years acknowldge
that she is in an institution
she believe were all
deliveryman milkman postal workers
to sustain the illusion that her children never died
she created an elaborate fictional structure
she gives us all parts to play in that fiction
so you searched the ground yet
the warden and his man scoured the island
not a trace
whats more disturbing is that we dont know
how she got out of her room
it was locked from the outside
and the only window is barred
its as if she evaporated straight
through the walls
brought her right back here after
group therapy locked her in
i came back for midnight rounde
and she was gone
seriously doctor how is it possible
the truth never gets through her
ie in an institution
mental illness right
seems like something youde
notice from time to time
how many pairs of shoes get patientsi
two pairs
sanity is not a choice marshal
you cant just choode to get over it
so  she left here barefoot
come on doc she cant get ten
yard in this terrain
marshall
the law of 4
whos 67
thats definitely rachels
handwriting
i have no idea what the  law of 4 is though
not a psychiatric term
im afraid not
whos 67
fuck if i know
ide have to say thats quite
close to my clinical conclusion
so you think its just
random scribblings
no not at all rachel is smart
brilliant in fact
this paper that could be important
excuse me doctor but
we need to hold onto this
of course
the departure had to come through here
after lights out the orderlies play
card in here
last night there were 7 man sitting
at the base of the atairs playing stud poker
and yet somehow rachel has managed
to slip by
why
how she turns invisible
doctor we need access to personal files
of all medical staff
of nurses guards orderlies
everyone who worked here
we take your request under consideration
this is not a request doctor
this is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner
patient
patient
has escaped now you can comply
all i can say is that i will see what i can do
doctor well need to speak with the staff
do you understand
ill assemble them in the
common room after dinner
if you have any further questions
feel free to join the dwputy warden in the search
its 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water is freesing
the current was strong last night
the tide pushing in
shes have drowned or been crushed on
the rocks her body would have washed back onshore
those caves down ther
have you checked them
no way she could get there
the base of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy live oak sumac
and a thousand plants with thorns
as big as my dick
you said it yourself marshall
shes got no shoes
all right boys
lets check the other side
whats that tower
an old lighthouse
the quards already searching inside it
whats in there more patients
sewage treatment facility
it will be dark soon
im calling this off for the night
lets go boys
you were watching the land right
yes
cant no one get in or out of their room
in that corridor without me seeing
all right rachel solando
who else does she had to pass
to get down here
me
glen miga
sir i saw nothing
and you were at your post all night
yes but i saw nothing
glen
glen
tell me the truth
im really  went to the bathroom
what you breached protocols christ
i was away only one minutes
all right i do not know what to expect here
lets back up
mrs solando was put in her room for lights out
does anybody knows what did she do
before taht
anyone
come on anyone anyone anyone
she was in a group therapy session
did anything unusual occur
defines unusual
excuse me
its a mental institution marshall
for criminally insane
usual isnt a big part of our day
i will rephrase
did anything happened last night
during and group therapy that was more
lets say more memorable than
normal
exactly
no im sorry
did mrs solando said anything
during group therapy
she was worried about the rain
and she hates the food here
complained constantly
last night including
so  you were there
in the presence of a doctor
dr sheehan led discuses
dr sheehan
yes he was running the session
hes rachelss primary
the psychaiatrist who directly
oversees her care
well need to speak with dr sheehan
im afraid that wont be possible
he left on the ferry in this morning
his vacation was already planned
hed putting it off too long
youre in a state of lockdown
a dangerous patient has escaped
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation
of course hes a doctor
do you have the phone number for
where hes gone
hello hello
hello
is anyone there
im sorry sir but it all down
all the lines
the storms hitting the
mainland as a hammer
if you get it working come find me immediately
the marshalls need to make an important call
yes sir
im afraid i have evening rounds in the wards
but ill be having drinks and a cigar at
my house around 9
if you like to drop by
good we can talk then right
we have been talking marshall
gotta say im thinking i went
into the wrong line of public service
it is a little overwhelming
it was constructed during the civil war
the same time as the military fort
houses ward c
this building is the original commanders quarters
it cost a fortune when uncle sam got the bill
the commander was courtmartialed
i can see why
nice music whos that brahms
no
its mahler
quite right marshall
forgive me gentlemen
my colleague dr jeremiah naehring
quartet for piano and strings
in a minor
your poison gentlemen
rye if youve got it
soda and ice please thanks
you dont indulge in alcohol
i am surprised
isnt it common for men in your
profession to imbibe
common enough
and yours
im sorry
your profession doctor psychiatry
ive always heared its overrun
with booceys and drunks
not that ive noticed
whats it cold tea in your glass
excellent marshall
you have outstanding defense mechanism
you must be quite adapt at interrogation
men like you  are my specialty
men of violence
thats a hell of assumption to make
no assumption not at all you misunderstand me
i said you are men of violence
im not accusing you of being violent man
its quite different
please please edify us doc
you both served overseas
not much of a stretch doc for all you know
we were both paper pushers over there
no you were not
since the schoolyard i would bet neither
of you has ever walked away from a physical conflict
not to suggest you enjoy it
but because retreat wasnt something you considered an option
wasnt raised to run doc
ah yes raised
and who raised you marshall
me
wolves
very impressive defense mechanism
do you believe in god marshall
im quite serious
thats rubbish
have you ever seen  a death camp doctor
i have i was there for the liberation of daqhau
your english is very good almost clawless
your english is very good
you hit the consonants a tad hard though
youre german
is legal immigration a crime marshall
oh i dont know doctor you to tell us
listen we need the files of sheehan
and on the rest of staff as well
no such file will be released for you
period
we gonna need those files
out of the question
bullshit there is no question
bullshit
anyway who is in charge here huh
dr naehring is the liaison to
our board of overseas
he relayed your request and its been refused
refused they dont have the authority to refuse and neither you sir
marshall continues your investigation
and we will do all we can to help
this investigation is over
we will file our reports
and handle it over
hoovers boys
hoovers boys thats right
well take the ferry back in the morning
come on chuck
nice night
youre bunking in the orderlies quarter
hey boss  we really gonna pack it in
why
i guess i dunno i just
never quit anything before
we havent heared the truth once yet chuck
rachel solando did not slipped out of
a locked room barefoot without any help
im beginning to think alot of help
maybe cawley sitting up in his mansion
right now
rethinking his whole attitudes
maybe in the morning
youre bluffing
i didnt said that
i found a whole stock of these teddy
jesus are you ever sober anymore
i killed alot of people in the war
is that why you drink
are you real
no
shes still here
who
rachel
she never left
remember when we stayed at the cabin
by the lake
we were so happy
shes here
you cant leave
im not gonna leave
i love you so much
i am the bones in a box teddy
no
i am
you have to wake up
i wont go
youre here
im not
you have to face that
but she is
and so is he
who
laeddis
i have to go
no please dont
just a little longer
oh teddy
let me go
i can not
aint gonna be no ferry in this shit
doctor
doctor doctor
we need to interview the patients who
were in rachels group therapy that night
i thought your investigation was finished
its not like we can take the ferry
and was rachel recieving any
other treatment for her illnesses
do you know what the state of
mental health field in these days gentelmen
no we are not doctors
war
the old schools believes in
surgical interventions
psychosurgery
the procedures are that the orbital lobotomy
some say that patientsi are reasonable
other essential say become zombies
and the new school
psycho pharmacology
a new drug has just been approved
of autorities
that relaxes psychotic patients
some would say tames then
and which school are you in doc
i
i have this radical idea that if you treat a
patient with respect
and listen to him
trying to understand
you just might reach him
these pacients
my point is
what should be the last resort
becomes the first response
give them a pill and put them in a corner
and it all goes away
rachel solando was a on a combination of drugs
meant to keep her from becoming violent
and it was only intermittently effective
the greatest obstacle to her recovery was
her refusal to face what she had done
was
is there a reason why you refer to
your patint in the past tensedoctor
look outside marshall
why do you think
next one is peter breen assaulted
his fathers nurse with a brocken glass
nurse survived but
her face permaanently disfigured
i cant wait
she smiles at me
she was so sweet
but  i could read in his eyes
she liked to be naked
liked to suck cock
all right mr breen
and asked me if she can have
a glass of water
alone in the kitchen
like thats no big deal
why was that a big deal
it was obvious
she wanted me to pull out my thing so she
could laugh at it
mr breen
we need to ask you some questions okay
when i cut her she screamed
but
she scared me
what did she expect
interesting
but we are here to talk
rachel solando ok
rachel solando
did you know she had drown her own kids
she drowned her kids
this is a sick fucking world
we live in ill tell you that
they should be gassed
all of them the retards killers
the niggers kill your own kids
gas the bitch
please stop that
a nurse
please stop that
a nurse maybe maybe she had kids
a husband
trying to make ends meet
to have a normal life
assisting your father
you tore her face off didnt you
congratulations no more normal
for her not ever again
do you know what she was afraid of
you
could you stop that please
stop that
please  stops
you know a patient by the name andrew laeddis
no no
i want to go back
ill never get out of here
im not sure i should
excuse me for saying it
miss kearns
god
mrs kearns
but you seem
quite normal
i mean in comparison
with the other patients here
well i have my dark days
i suppose everyone does
differents is that most people dont kill
their husbands with an axe
although personally i think if a
man beats you and fuck
half the women he sees
and no one will help you
axing him isnt the least understandable
thing you can do
maybe you shouldnt get out
and what would i do if i did
i dont know the world anymore
they say there are
bombs that can turn whole
cities to ash
and what do they call television
voices and faces coming from a box
i hear enough voices already
what can you tell us about rachel
no much she she keep to herself
she believes her kids were alive
she thought she was still living
in berkshire and we were all neighbours
milkman postman
deliveryman
dr sheehan was there that night
yes
he talked about anger
tell me about him
whats he like
i think e
ok nice
not hard on the eyes
just my mother would say
did he ever come passing you
no
no dr sheehan is a good doctor he wouldnt
could i have a glass of water please
no problem
thank you marshall
i have just one more question
mrs kearns
did you ever meet a patient
named andrew laeddis
no
never heard of him
she was coached
he used the same words as
cawleys and the nurse
its like shed been told exactly what to say
who is andrew laeddis
you asked every one of those patients
about him whos he
what the hell boss im your partner
for the gods sake
we just met chuck
there are the job long
you got a duty a career
and what im doing
not exactly by the book
i dont give a damn about the book boss
but i need to know what the hell is going on
when this case came over the wires
i requested it specifically do you understand
why
andrew laeddis
was the maintenance man in thr apartment
building where my wife and i lived
okay
he was also a firebug
andrew laeddis lit the match
that caused the fire that killed my wife
open the
what happened with laeddis
got away
laeddis got away and disappeared
about a year ago i opened the
newspaper and there he is
hes an ugly son of a bitch
he had a new scar in the right temple
down to his left lip
eyes different colors
not a type of face you forget
hed burned a schoolhouse killed 2 people
he said voices told him to do that
first he was sent to prison
and then he was transferred here
then what
then nothing
he vanished like he never existed
no records forever
im sure hes not in ward b
that leaves ward c
or he could be dead
so could rachel solando
lots of places to hide a body here
only one place where
no one really knows
the patient  bridget kearne
when she sent me for water
she said something back to you didnt she
no
come on boss
she wrote it
run
boss
we must get inside its turning
into fucking kansas out here
all right now
lets go
watch out
jesus
come on lets go back
jesus christ
damn it
are you okay boss
yes thats all right
so  you think laeddis is here
what are you going to do boss
im not here to kill leaddis
if it were my wife
id kill him twice
when we got through the gates of dachau
the ss guards surrendered
the commander tried to kill himself
before we got there
but he botched it
took him an hour to die
when i went outside
i saw bodies on the ground
too many to count
too many to imagine
so yeah
the guards surrendered we took
their guns lined them up
i wasnt warfair
it was murder
im tired of killing
thats not why im here
so what is it all about
after laeddis vanished
i started doing some checking
on ashecliffe
lot of people knew about this place but no
one wants to talk
like theyre scared of something
you know this place is funded by
special grants
from the house of
american activities committee
great and how exactly are we fighting
the countries from an island in boston harbor
by conducting experiments on the mind
at least thats my guess
and you think thats going on in here
as i said nobodys talking right
until i found someone
who used to be a patient here
guys name george noyce
nice college kid
socialist
he got an offer to get some money for some psych study guess what they were testing
drug tests
he started seeing dragons everywhere
almost beat his proffesor to death
end up appearing in ashecliffe
ward c
they released him after 1 year right
what does he do
two weeks on a mainland
he walks into a bar and stabs three men to death
his lawyer pleads insanity
but noyce
stands up in the courtroom and
he begs the judge
for the electric chair
anywhere but not a
mental hospital
judge give him life in the dedham prison
and you have you found him
yes ive found him
hes a mess
but it is pretty clear from what he tells me
theyre experimenting on people here
i do not know boss
i don not believe a crazy
thats the beauty of it
crazy people are a perfect subject
they talk but nobody listened
i stood in dachau
we saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other right
for christ sake we fought a goddamn war
to stop them
and now find out it may be happening here
on our land
no
what are you really here to do teddy
im here to get the proof
im gonna go back and blow
the lid off this place
thats it
wait a minute
you started asking around about ashecliffe
waiting for a chance to get out here
then suddenly they need a us marshall
i got lucky a patient escaped
it was the perfect excuse
no no no boss
luck doesnt work that way
the world doesnt work that way
they got electric fence around a septic facility
ward c is inside a civil war fort
a chief of staff with ties to the ss
funding from huac
jesus christ everything in this place
stinks  government ops
what if they wanted you here
bullshit
ask questions
nonsense
bullshit where is rachel soalndo
where is one shred of evidence that she even existed
i had to know where
that will give me any in any case
while you were looking at that neighbourhood
theyre looking at you
all they need to do
is making a fake escape to get you here
and now they have you
they have us bothhere now
marshall are you here
please signal us this is deputy warden mcpherson
marshall
how about that they found us
its an island boss theyll always find us
i know you are in there
we get out of this fucking island
you and me
come on
come on
go
get dry off
dr cawley wants to talk to you now
and hurry up this thing is transforming
to a goddamn hurricane
i dopped those suits to be cleaned
it should be ready by tomorrow
if we dont all wash away first
speaking of which im afraid your smoke were
pretty much done for
so
its our only choice right
thats something really nice in prison already
that
now that you mention it it is just fine
thats why i must repeat my insistence
that all ward c patients
be placed in manual restrains
if the facility floods theyll drown
you know that
that would take a lot of flooding
we are on an island
in the middle of the ocean
during a hurricane
a lot of flooding seems like a
distinct possibility
its a gamble steven
say the power fails
theres a backup generators
and if htat goes the cell doors
will open
where are they to go
they cant just hop a ferry scoot over
to the mainland over a weak havoc
youre right probably responsible
recovery right here on us
if theyre manacled to the floor they die
24 human beings
you cant live with that can you
frankly if it were up to me
id put all 42 in ward a and b in
manual restrains as well
excuse me
excuse me
marshall
im sorry i have one quick question
yes i will be with you in a moment
when we spoke this morning about rachel solandos note
the law of 4 i loved that
you told me you had no idea what
that second line could refer to
whos 67
yes im afraid i still do not know
none of us knows
nothing comes to mind
nothing
because i believed i just heard
you say that there are
24 patients in ward c
and 42 of patients in wards a and b
which would mean there are
66 patients here in this facility
thats correct yes
then it seems that
rachel solando was suggesting
you have a 67th paient doctor
but im afraid we dont
this is ridiculous
what are you doing here
we are doing our goddamn job
didnt mcpherson tell you the good news
no whats the good news doctor
rachel has been found
its here
safe and sound
there is not a mark on her
who are these men
why are they in my home
police officers rachel
they  have a few questions
maam
theres been a sighting of a known
communist
subversive in this area
passing out literature
here
in this neighborhood
yes im afraid so
if you have tell us what you have done yesterday where you were
itll help us narrow  our search
yes
well i
i made breakfast for jim
and the children
and then i
i packed jims lunch
and he left
then i sent the children off to school
and then

lets get the hell out of here
this way
just keep going
we belong here
what happened to you
what do you mean
where were you
after we got that guy to the infirmary
i took a little detect
to patient records
did you find laeddis
no
i didnt find him
i find next best thing
in his intake form
thats all that was in his file
no session note no incident reports
no photograph just this
it was weired
here take a look
ill take a look later
whats the matter boss
ill look at it later
thats all
ashecliffes that way
im not going to ashecliffe
im going to the lighthouse
im going to find out what
the fuck is hapening in thid island
here it is
damn
too far north
well have to double back
theres no way to cros those rocks
there could be a way behind those trees
maybe a path that goes around the rocks
to the lighthouse
what are we doing here
weve get the intake form
it proofs thers a 67th patient
who theyve said repeatedly he doesnt exist
im getting to that lighthouse
do you understand
what can i say to you stop
why would you want to
because climbing down there
when its dark  suicide
okay
maybe its better you sit this one out
you brought me into this boss
and now i am trapped on this rock
on the island
without anyone we know
and now you acting like
like what
how my acting
what the hell happened
in those cells ted
what do you think weather is like in portland chuck
im from seattle
seattle
ill go alone alone
come with you partner
i said alone
fine
damn it
damn it
i knew it will take long
but i couldnt get there because tide is on
chuck
chuck
come on
chuck
where are you chuck
chuck
chuck
who are you
i am teddy daniels
im a cop
youre a marshal
thats right
would you mind mind
take your hands from behind
your back
why
why
to make sure what you
have hold there does not hurt me
im gonna keep this
if you do not mind
fine with me
youre rachel solando
the real one
did you kill your children
i never had children
i was never married
before i be a patient
in ashecliff i worked here
you were a nurse
i was a doctor marshall
you think im crazy
no i
and if i say im not crazy
well that hardly helps does it
thats the kafkaesque genius of it
people always tell you youre crazy
and protested on the contrary
confirm what they say
i do not following you
im sorry
once you are declared insane
then anything you do is called
as a part of insanity
your reasonable protests
or denial
valid fears
paranoia
survival instincts
as defense mechanisms
youre smarter than you look marshall
thats probably not a good thing
tell me something
yes
what happened to you
i started asking about shipping this
this large amount of sodium
and the sodiumbased hallucinogens
psychotropic drugs
and i began to ask about the surgeries too
ever heard of transorbital lobotomy
they cap the patient with electroshocks
then go through the eye with an ice pick
and pull out some nerve fibers
makes the patient more obedient
tractable
its barbaric
unconscionable
do you know how pain enters the
body marshal do you
depends on where you hurt
no it has nothing to the flesh
the brain controls pain
the brain controls fear empathy
sleep anger hunger  everything
what if you could control it
the brain
to recreate a man
so he doesnt feel pain
or love or sympathy
a man who cant be interrogated
because he has no memories to confess
they can never takes
all men memories
never
and you know the north koreans
use american pows
during brainwashing experiments
they turns soldiers into traitors
thats what they are doing here
creates ghosts and give way in the world
and do things sane man never do
that kind of ability that kind of knowledge
it would take years
years of research
experiments on hundreds of patients
for 50 years now
people will look back
and they say  this place
is where it all began
the nazis used the jews
the soviets
used prisoners in their own gulags
and we
we tested patients
on shutter island
no they wont
no
you do understand
that they cant let you leave
im a federal marshall
they cant stop me
i was a esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family
it did not matter
let me ask you
any past trauma in your life
yes why why that matter
if a particular event is past
the reason you lost your sanity
so when they commit you in here
your friends colleagues will say
he has cracked
and who would do it
after what happened
that could be said of anyone
anyone at all
the point is theyre going to say it about you
hows your head
my head
you had funny dreams
trouble sleeping headaches
im prone to migraine
jesus
you havent taken any pills no
not even aspire
i get a aspirin
jesus
and you ate in the canteen and of drinking
coffee that gave it
tell me that even
smoking cigars of you
not  no
i havent
it takes between 36 and 48 hours for
neuroleptics narcotics
to reach sufficient blood
that youand take effect
pulse will become first
fingers first and then
shall include all labor
seen any waking nightmares lately
marshall
tell me whats going on in that lighthouse
tell me
brain surgery
like to open the skull to see
what if we pull on this kind
thats not different with nazis kind
and then they created the ghosts
who knows about this
on the islandm i mean who
everyone
come on the nurses the orderlies
its not possible
everybody
you cant stay here
they think im dead that i drowned
if they come looking for you they might finf me
im sorry but you have to go
im gonna come back for you
i will not be here i move during the day
new places every night
but i could come get you
take you out of the island
havent you heard a word ive said
the only way off the island
is ferry and they control it
youll never leave here
i had a friend
he was with me yesterday
but we got seperated
have you seen him
marshall
you have no friends
there you are
weve been wondering when
youd show up
take a seat
come on
taking a leisurely stroll were we
i just
just looking around
did you enjoy
gods latest gift
what
the gods gifts
the violence
when i came downstaires in my home
and saw a tree in my living room
it reached for me like a divine hand
god loves violence
i hadnt noticed
sure you have
why else would there be so much of it
its in us
what we are
we wage war we burn sacrifices
we pillage and plunder
and treat at the flesh
of our brothers
and why because god gave us violence
to wage in his honor
i thought god gave us moral orders
there is no moral orders
as pure as this storm
theres no moral order at all
theres just this
can my violence conquer yours
im not violent
you are
youre violent as they come
i know because i am as violent as they come
from constructred society
we were lifted
if i always stood between you and my meal you
would crack my skull with rock and steal my meal
poor you
cawley thinks youre harmless you can be
controled but i know are different
you dont know me
oh but i do
weve known each other for centuries
if i am to send my teeth to sank into your eye
right now
could you stop me before i blinded you
give it a try
thats the spirit
where have you been
wandering just looking at your island
youll be leaving
now that rachel has been found
sure
big meeting
oh yes
apparently there was an unidentified man
in ward c yesterday
he subdued a very dangerous patient
quite handly
even so
it seems he had a long concersation with a
paranoid schizophrenic george noyce
this noyce
so you said his name was
hes delusional right
oh extremely he can be quite upseting
in fact two weeks ago a patient
was so worked up
over one of noyces stories
that he beat him up
cigarette
no thanks
i quit
so youll taking the ferry
absolutely
i think weve gotten
all we came here for
we marshall
speaking of a
youve seen him doctor
who
my partner chuck
you dont have a partner marshall
you came here alone
you know ive built something valuable here
but valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time
everyone wants a quick fix
they always have
im trying to do something that people
that even you dont undersyand
and im not going to give up
without a fight
i can see that
so tell me again
about your partner
what partner
marshall
going somewhere
no just  take my way
to ferry
im afraid its the other side
if you wait a moment
i find someone to take you
to the port
what is this doctor
its just a sedative
its for precaution
precaution
what are you going to do
to kill me
you think you deserve it
for what
for provoking you
and forgive me
what doesnt provoke you
remarks
words
nazi
and that too
and of course memories dreams
did you knew that the word trauma comes
from a greek word of wound
and whats the german word for dream
is traumen
traumen
a dream
wounds can creates monsters
and you
you are wounded marshall
i think youre agree
when you see a monster
you must stop it
i agree
yes
what are you doing baby
youve got to get to the ferry
no not  no
if the world thinks that chuck is dead
then he is perfect for their experiments
only one place theyd take him
you go there and youll die
hes my partner if theyre hurting him
holding him against his will i have to bring him out
i can not lose anyone else
do not go there
please don t do this teddy
im sorry honey
i love this because
you gave it to me
but the truth is
its one fucking ugly tie
no
do not move
stay where you are
are you going to kill me
no
i will not kill you
why are you all wet baby
what did you say
you know exactly what i said
the rifles empty by the way
have a seat
for gods sake dry off
youre going to catch cold
all right
how badly did you hurt the guard
i do not know what
are you talking about
yes hes here
have drsheehan take a good look
at your man before you send him up
so dr shehan
he came on the ferry
this morining
not exactly
you blew up my car
i really loved that car
sorry to hear about that
tremors are getting pretty bad
how are the hallucinations
go away teddy
this place is gonna be the end of you
not bad
theyll get worse
i know
dr solando
she told me about neuroleptics
did she now
and when was this
i found her doctorin a cave on the cliffs
but you wont get her
i dont doubt it
considerations are not real
but your hallucinations are
more severe than i thought
you are not on neuroleptics
you are not on neuroleptics
as a matter of fact
then what the fuck is this
huh what the fuck is this
withdrawal
withdrawal
from what i havent even had a goddamned
drink since we got on this island
chlorpromazine
im not a fan of pharmacology
but i have to see in your case
clorpro  like you said
chlorpromazine
the same thing weve
been giving you for the last 24 months
so in the past two years
you have had somebody in boston
who gave me drugs
not boston
here
youve been here for two years
a patient of this institutions
after everythings i see here doctor
you really thinks you can
convince me im crazy
you know what kind of people we are dealing
im us marshal
you were a us marshal
heres a copy of your intake form
you broke into ward c for
proof of the 67th patient
if youd gotten to the mainland
you could have blown the lid off this place
wait wait
but somehow
and yet you couldnt find time
to look at it yet read it
go ahead
the patient is highly intelligent
highly delusional
decorated army veteran
prisoned for the
liberation of dachav
former us marshal
known proclivity for violence
shown no remorse for his crime because
his denial is such
that no crime ever took place
highly developed and fantastical
narratives which preclude facing
the truth of his actions
i am tired of this bullshits
wheres my partner
wheres chuck
where is he
lets try this in another way
your wifes maiden name was
chana am i correct
not even talk about her
im afraid i have to
notice anything these four names have in common
the rule 4
andrew what do you see
if you done anything
to my partner doctor it is a violation
focus andrew what do you see
the names
have the same letters
edward daniels has exactly same
13 letters
as andrew laeddis
the same as rachel and solando
and dolore chan all names
are anagrams of each other
tactics of intimidation
it doesnt work on me
you came here for the truth
here it is
your name is andrew laeddis
the 67th patient at ashecliffe
is you andrew
bullshit
you were committed here by
court order 24 months ago
your crimes terrible
one you cant forgieve yourself
so you invented
another self
let us return to the facts
and have created a story in which
youre not a murderer you are hearless
you are a us marshal
only here in ashkliff
because of a case
and youve uncovered conspiracy
so that anything we tell you about
who you are what youve done
you can dismiss as lies andrew
my name is edward daniels
ive been hearing this fantasy
for two years i know every details
patient 67 storm
rachel solando
your missing partner
dreams you have every night
you were at dachave
but it could not have killed any guards
i wish i could let you just
live in your fantasy world
i really do
but are violent trained dangerous
youre the most dangerous patient we have
youve injured all of the guards
other patients
two weeks ago
you attacked george noyce
i did so something
you have
off course i didnt
give me one reason
why i even touch him
because he called you laeddis
and you do anything not to be him
i have a transcript of that conversation
you had with noyce yesterday
this is about you and laeddis
thats all its ever been about
this says its about
me and laeddis
when youve asked him what happened
to his face
said and i quote again
you did it
he meant it was my fault he
you almost killed him
the warden and the board of overseas
are determined that something be done its been decided
nevertheles we can bring you back in sanity now
right now
permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you cant hurt anyone ever again
they lobotomine you andrew
do you understand
yes i understand
i understand just fine
if  if i dont play along
with your little game here
dr naehring will turn me into
one of his ghosts
what about my partner
you mean a us marshal
is a  defense mechanism
hey boss
what the fuck is going on here
youre working for him
im sorry about that
someone had to stay with you keep you safe
youve been watch me right
watch me every minute
who  who are you
who are you

ive been you primary psychiatrist
for the last two years
i am lester sheehan
and i told you about my wife
i know
i climbed a cliff to save you
i trusted you i risked
everything after you everything
i know boss
were running out of time here andrew
i swore before the entire board of
overseas that i could construct
the most radical roleplay
ever in history of psychiatry and
that will bring you back
i thought if we let you play
this out
we could get you to see how
untrue how impossible it is
weve had to tun of the place for two days
tell me where are the nazi experiments
the satanic ors
andrew listen to me
if we fail on you
then everything weve tried
to do here will be discredited
everything
we are on the first line of a war andrew
and right now in this place
it comes down to you
do not move
andrew no
my name is teddy daniels
this one is loaded
i can tell from the weight
i see and thats your firearm marshall
youre sure
theres a dent in the barrel from
the day philip stacks shot at me
and the bullet ricocheted youre not going to mindfuck me out of this doc
then blast away because thats the
only way youre ever getting off this island
andrew please dont

what have you done to
my goddamned gun
its a toy andrew
were telling you the truth
dolores was insane manicdepressive
suicidal
you drank stay away
ignored what everyone told you
you moved in that lake house after
she purposely
set your city apartment on fire
andrew andrew

i have no children
your wife drowned them
in the cabin by the lake
and here the little girl
you dream about
every night

the one who tells you over and over that
you should saved her
save them all
your daughter
her name is rachel are you going to deny
that she ever lived
andrew are you
im so sorry honey

andrew
andrew can you hear me
rachel
rachel rachel
rachel
rachel who
rachel laeddis
my daughter
why are you here
because i killed my wife
and why did you do that
she murdered our children
and she told me to let her go
who is teddy daniels
he doesnt exist
neither rachel solando
i made them up
why
we need to hear you say it
after she trie to kill
her for the first time
dolores told me that
she has an insect
living inside her brain
she could feel it
walking cross
her skull
pulling the wires
just for fun
she told me that
she told me but i didnt listen
i loved her so much
why did you make them up
because i can not take knowing
that dolores killed our children
i killed them because
i didnt get her some help
i killed them
heres my theory andrew
we broke through once before
nine months ago
and then you regressed
i do not remember that
i know
you reset andrew
like a tape
playing over and over on an endless loop
i hope that what weve done will be enough
to stop it from happening again
i need to know
that you have accepted the reality
you came after me doctor
you tried to help me when no one else would
my name is andrew laeddis
and i murdered my wife
in the spring of 1952
how we doing this morning
good
and you
cant complain
so whats our next move
you tell me
weve gotta get off this rock
chuck
back to the mainland whatever the
hell is going on here is bad
do not worry partner

that is too small for them
yes we are

me wonder
