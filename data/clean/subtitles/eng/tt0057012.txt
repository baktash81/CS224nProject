western leaders   
   that the soviet union had been at
work on what was hinted to be   
   the ultimate weapon 
a doomsday device 
intelligence sources traced the site
of the top secret russian project   
   to the perpetually fog shrouded
wasteland   
   below the arctic peaks
of the zhokhov islands 
   below the arctic peaks
of the zhokhov islands 
what they were building   
   or why it should be located in such
a remote and desolate place   
   no one could say 
 general ripper  sir 
 group captain mandrake speaking 
 this is general ripper speaking 
 yes  sir 
 do you recognize my voice 
 i do  sir  why do you ask 
why do you think i ask 
well  i don t know  sir  we spoke
just a few moments ago  didn t we 
you don t think i d ask unless it was
pretty damned important  do you 
 no  i don t  sir  no 
 let s see if we can stay on the ball 
has the wing confirmed holding
at their fail safe points 
yes  sir  the confirmations
have all just come in 
very well 
now  listen to me carefully 
the base is being
put on condition red 
i want this flashed
to all sections immediately 
condition red  jolly good idea 
keeps the men on their toes 
i m afraid this is not an exercise 
not an exercise  sir 
i shouldn t tell you this  but you re a
good officer and have a right to know 
it looks like
we re in a shooting war 
oh  hell 
 are the russians involved 
 that s all i ve been told 
it came in on the red phone  i m gonna
follow orders and seal this base tight 
now  i want you to
transmit plan r   
   r for robert  to the wing 
 plan r for robert 
 is it that bad  sir 
 looks like it s pretty hairy 
 yes  sir 
plan r for robert  sir 
now  last  and possibly
most important   
   i want all privately owned radios
to be immediately impounded 
they might be used to issue
instructions to saboteurs 
as i previously arranged  air police
will have lists of all owners 
i want every single one of them
collected without exception 
after you ve done that 
report back to me 
in order to guard against
surprise nuclear attack   
   america s
strategic air command   
   maintains a large force
of b 52 bombers   
   airborne 24 hours a day 
each b 52 can deliver a nuclear
bomb load of 50 megatons   
   equal to 16 times the total explosive
force of all the bombs and shells   
   used by all the armies
in world war ll 
based in america 
the airborne alert force   
   is deployed from the persian gulf
to the arctic ocean 
but they have one geographical factor
in common 
they are all two hours
from their targets inside russia 
major kong  i know you ll think
this is crazy   
   but i just got a message from base
over the crm 114 
it decodes as wing attack plan r 
r for romeo 
goldie  did you say
wing attack plan r 
goldie  did you say
wing attack plan r 
yes  sir  i have 
goldie  how many times have
i told you guys   
   that i don t want
no horsing around on the airplane 
i m not horsing around  sir 
that s how it decodes 
well  i ve been to one world fair 
a picnic and a rodeo   
   and that s the stupidest thing
i ever heard over earphones 
you sure you got today s code 
yes  sir  it is 
there s just gotta be
something wrong 
wait a second  i m coming back 
maybe you d better get
a confirmation from base 
yes  sir 
major kong  is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test 
give the go code and then recall
to see who would actually go 
ain t nobody ever got
the go code yet 
ain t nobody ever got
the go code yet 
old ripper wouldn t be giving us
plan r   
   unless them russkies had
clobbered washington   
   and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack 
yes  sir 
major kong  message
from base confirmed 
well  boys  i reckon this is it 
nuclear combat toe to toe
with the russkies 
now  look  boys  i ain t much
of a hand at making speeches 
but i got a pretty fair idea
that something doggone important   
   is going on back there 
now  i ve got a fair idea of the kind
of personal emotions   
   that some of you fellows
may be thinking 
heck  i reckon you wouldn t even be
human beings   
   if you didn t have strong personal
feelings about nuclear combat 
but i want you to remember
one thing 
that folks back home
is counting on you   
   and by golly 
we ain t about to let them down 
tell you something else 
if this thing turns out to be half as
important as i figure it just might be   
   i d say that you re all in line
for some important promotions   
   and personal citations
when this thing s over with 
and that goes for
every last one of you   
   regardless of your race 
color or your creed 
now  let s get this thing on the hump 
we got some flying to do 
buck  should i get it 
yeah  you have to 
hello 
yes  general turgidson is here   
   he can t come
to the phone at the moment 
well  this is his secretary 
miss scott 
freddie  how are you 
fine  and you 
oh  we were just catching up
on some of the general s paperwork 
well  look  freddie  he s tied up
at the moment 
i m afraid
he can t come to the phone 
just a minute 
general turgidson 
a colonel puntrich calling 
tell him to call back 
freddie  the general says could you
call back in a minute or two 
he says it can t wait 
for pete s  
find out what he wants 
freddie  the thing is  the general
is in the powder room right now 
could you tell me what it s about 
just a second 
apparently they monitored
a transmission eight minutes ago   
   from burpelson air force base 
right  it was directed to the
843rd bomb wing on airborne alert 
it decoded as wing attack plan r 
well  tell him to call what s his name 
the base commander  ripper 
do i have to think of everything 
the general suggests you call general
ripper  the 843rd base commander 
all communications are dead 
bull  tell him to do it himself 
freddie  the general asks if
you could possibly try again yourself 
i see  he says he s tried personally
several times  but everything is dead 
even the normal phone lines
are shut down 
fred  buck  what s it look like 
yeah 
well  are you sure it s plan r 
what s cooking on the threat board 
nothing  nothing at all 
i don t like the look of this  fred 
tell you what you better do 
old buddy 
give elmo and charlie a blast 
bump everything up to condition red 
stand by the blower 
i ll get back to you 
 what s up 
 nothing  nothing 
 where s my shorts 
 on the floor  where are you going 
no place 
i thought i might mosey over to the
war room  see what s doing over there 
it s 3 00 in the morning 
the air force never sleeps 
buck  honey  i m not sleepy either 
i know how it is  baby 
tell you what you do 
you just start your countdown
and old bucky will be back here   
   before you can say   blastoff  
your commie has no regard
for human life  not even his own 
and for this reason  men 
i want to impress upon you   
   the need
for extreme watchfulness 
the enemy may come individually
or he may come in strength 
he may even come in the uniform
of our own troops 
but however he comes 
we must stop him 
we must not allow him
to gain entrance to this base 
now  i am going to give you
three simple rules 
first  trust no one 
whatever his uniform or rank   
   unless he is known
to you personally 
second  anyone or anything   
   that approaches within 200 yards
of the perimeter is to be fired upon 
third  if in doubt  shoot first
and ask questions afterwards 
i would sooner accept
a few casualties through accident   
   than lose the entire base and
its personnel through carelessness 
any variation on these rules
must come from me personally 
now  men  in conclusion   
   i would like to say
that in the two years   
   it has been my privilege
to be your commanding officer   
   i have always expected
the best from you   
   and you have never given me
anything less than that 
today the nation is counting on us 
we are not going to let them down 
good luck to you all 
here s the attack profile  sir 
this is your attack profile 
 to ensure that the enemy cannot
monitor voice transmission   
   or plant false transmission   
   the crm 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits 
the emergency base code prefix
is to be set   
   on the dials of the crm 
this will block any transmission other
than those preceded by a code prefix 
stand by to set code prefix

switch all receiver circuits
to crm discriminators

excuse me  sir  something rather
interesting has just cropped up 
listen to that  music 
civilian broadcasting 
i think the pentagon has given us
an exercise to test our readiness 
i think it s taking things too far 
our fellows will be inside russian
radar cover in 20 minutes 
listen to that  chock a block
full of stations  all churning it out 
 mandrake 
 yes  sir 
i thought i issued instructions
for all radios to be impounded 
you did  and i was in the process of
impounding this when i switched it on 
i thought  our fellows hitting russian
radar  dropping all their stuff   
   i d better tell you  because if
they do  it ll cause a bit of a stink 
group captain 
the officer exchange program   
   does not give you any special
prerogatives to question my orders 
i realize that  sir  but i thought you d
be rather pleased to hear the news 
i mean  after all    
well  let s face it 
we don t want to start a nuclear war
unless we really have to  do we 
please sit down 
and turn that thing off 
yes  sir 
what about the planes 
surely we must issue
the recall code immediately 
group captain  the planes
are not gonna be recalled 
my attack orders have been issued
and the orders stand 
if you ll excuse me saying so  sir 
that would be  to my way of thinking   
   rather an odd way
of looking at it 
if a russian attack
was in progress   
   we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting 
 are you certain of that 
 i m absolutely positive 
and what if it is true 
i m afraid i m still not with you  sir 
because  i mean    
if a russian attack
was not in progress   
   then your use of plan r   in fact 
your orders to the entire wing    
i would say that there was something
dreadfully wrong somewhere 
why don t you take it easy 
group captain 
please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater   
   and help yourself
to whatever you d like 
general ripper  sir  as an officer
in her majesty s air force   
   it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances   
   to issue the recall code upon my
own authority and bring back the wing 
if you ll excuse me  sir 
sir  i must ask you for the key
and the recall code 
have you got them handy 
i told you to take it easy 
group captain 
there s nothing anybody can do
about this now 
i m the only person who knows
the code group 
then i must insist  sir 
that you give them to me 
do i take it  sir  you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun 
mandrake  i suppose
it never occurred to you   
   that while we re chatting here
so enjoyably   
   a decision is being made
by the president   
   and the joint chiefs in the war room
at the pentagon 
and when they realize there is
no possibility of recalling the wing   
   there will be only one course
of action open 
total commitment 
mandrake  do you recall what
clemenceau once said about war 
no  i don t think i do  sir  no 
he said war was too important
to be left to the generals 
when he said that  50 years ago   
when he said that  50 years ago   
   he might have been right 
but today   
   war is too important
to be left to politicians 
they have neither the time 
the training   
   nor the inclination
for strategic thought 
i can no longer sit back
and allow   
   communist infiltration 
communist indoctrination   
   communist subversion   
   and the international
communist conspiracy   
   to sap and impurify   
   all of our precious bodily fluids 
staines  is everybody here 
mr  president  the secretary of state
is in vietnam 
the secretary of defense is in laos 
the vice president is in mexico city 
we can establish contact with them
at any time 
the undersecretaries are all here 
right  now  general turgidson 
what s going on here 
mr  president   
   about 35 minutes ago   
   general jack ripper 
the commanding general   
   general jack ripper 
the commanding general   
   of burpelson air force base   
   issued an order to the 34 b 52s
of his wing   
   which were airborne
at the time   
   as part of a special exercise we were
holding called operation dropkick 
now  it appears that the order
called for the planes   
   to attack their targets
inside russia 
the planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons   
   with an average load
of 40 megatons each 
now  the central display of russia will
indicate the position of the planes 
the triangles
are their primary targets 
the squares
are their secondary targets 
the aircraft will begin penetrating
russian radar cover within 25 minutes 
general turgidson  i find this
very difficult to understand 
i was under the impression
i was the only one in authority   
   to order the use of
nuclear weapons 
that s right  sir  you are
the only person authorized to do so 
and although i hate to judge
before all the facts are in   
   it s beginning to look like
general ripper exceeded his authority 
it certainly does  far beyond the point
i would have imagined possible 
well  perhaps you re forgetting
the provisions of plan r  sir 
plan r 
plan r is an emergency war plan   
   in which a lower echelon
commander may order   
   nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack   
   if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted 
you approved it  sir 
you must remember 
surely you must recall  sir 
when senator beaufort   
   made that big hassle about
our deterrent lacking credibility 
the idea was for plan r to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard 
a safeguard 
i admit the human element
seems to have failed us here 
but the idea was to discourage
the russkies from any hope   
   they could knock out washington 
and yourself   
   as part of a sneak attack   
   and escape retaliation because of
lack of proper command and control 
   and escape retaliation because of
lack of proper command and control 
i assume the planes will return
automatically   
   once they reach their
fail safe points 
no  sir  i m afraid not  the planes
were holding at their fail safe points   
   when the go code was issued 
once they fly beyond fail safe  they do
not require a second order to proceed 
they will continue
until they reach their target 
then why haven t you radioed the
planes  countermanding the go code 
i m afraid we re unable to
communicate with any of the aircraft 
why 
as you may recall  sir   
   one of the provisions
of plan r provides   
   that once the go code
is received   
   the normal ssb radios
in the aircraft   
   are switched into
a special coded device   
   which i believe is designated
as crm 114 
now  in order
to prevent the enemy   
   from issuing fake
or confusing orders   
   crm 114 is designed
not to receive at all   
   unless the message is preceded   
   by the correct three letter
code group prefix 
do you mean to tell me  general  you
will be unable to recall the aircraft 
that s the size of it 
however  we are plowing through   
   every possible three letter
combination of the code 
but since there are
17 000 permutations   
   it s going to take us about two days
to transmit them all 
how soon will planes penetrate
russian radar cover 
 eighteen minutes from now 
 are you in contact with ripper 
no  sir  general ripper sealed off
the base and cut off communications 
 where did you get this information 
 general ripper called   
   strategic air command headquarters
shortly after he issued the go code 
i have a portion of the transcript 
if you d like me to read it 
read it 
the duty officer asked
general ripper   
   to confirm the fact that he had
issued the go code and he said 
 yes  gentlemen  they are on their way
in and no one can bring them back 
for the sake of our country
and our way of life   
   i suggest you get the rest of sac
in after them 
otherwise  we will be totally destroyed
by red retaliation 
my boys will give you the best kind
of start  1400 megatons  worth 
and you sure as hell
won t stop them now 
so let s get going 
there s no other choice 
god willing  we will prevail
in peace and freedom from fear   
   and in true health
through the purity   
   and essence of our natural   
   fluids 
god bless you all  
then he hung up 
we re still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase 
there s nothing to figure out 
this man is obviously a psychotic 
i d like to hold off judgment on a thing
like that  sir  until all the facts are in 
general turgidson  when you
instituted the human reliability tests   
   you assured me there was
no possibility   
   of such a thing ever occurring 
well  i don t think it s quite fair
to condemn the whole program   
   because of a single slip up  sir 
   because of a single slip up  sir 
i wanna speak to general ripper
on the telephone 
i m afraid that s impossible 
general turgidson  i am becoming
less and less interested   
   in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible 
 general faceman 
 yes  sir 
are there any army units
stationed near burpelson 
i ll just check  sir 
hello 
i told you never to call me here 
don t you know where i am 
look  baby  i can t talk to you now 
my president needs me 
of course bucky would rather
be there with you 
of course it isn t only physical 
i deeply respect you
as a human being 
someday i m gonna make you
mrs  buck turgidson 
oh  listen  you go back to sleep 
bucky will be back there
just as soon as he can 
all right  listen  sug 
don t forget to say your prayers 
apparently 
the 23rd airborne division   
   is stationed seven miles away
at alvarado 
general faceman  i want them to enter
the base  locate general ripper   
   and put him
in immediate contact with me 
yes  sir 
mr  president  if i may advise 
under a condition red  it is standard
procedure the base be sealed off   
   and the base defended
by base security troops 
any force trying to enter there would
certainly encounter heavy casualties 
general turgidson  with all due
respect for your defense team   
   my boys can brush them aside
without too much trouble 
mr  president  there are one or two
points i d like to make  if i may 
go ahead  general 
one  our hopes for recalling
the 843rd bomb wing   
   are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability 
two  in less than 15 minutes
from now   
   the russkies will be making
radar contact with the planes 
three  when they do   
   they will go absolutely ape and
strike back with everything they ve got 
four  if  prior to this time   
   we have done nothing to suppress
their retaliatory capabilities   
   we will suffer virtual annihilation 
now   
   five 
if  on the other hand   
   we immediately launched an attack
on their airfields and missile bases   
   we d stand a good chance of
catching them with their pants down 
we ve got a 5 to 1
missile superiority 
we could easily assign three missiles
to every target   
   and still have an effective reserve
force for any other contingency 
six  an unofficial study which
we undertook of this eventuality   
   indicated that we would destroy
90 percent of their nuclear capabilities 
we would therefore prevail   
   and suffer only modest civilian
casualties from their remaining force   
   which would be badly damaged
and uncoordinated 
general  it is the avowed policy
of our country   
   never to strike first
with nuclear weapons 
   never to strike first
with nuclear weapons 
well  mr  president  i d say ripper
has already invalidated that policy 
that was not an act of national policy 
there are still alternatives open to us 
mr  president   
   we are rapidly approaching
a moment of truth   
   both for ourselves
and for the life of our nation 
now  truth is not always
a pleasant thing 
but it is necessary now
to make a choice 
to choose between two
admittedly regrettable   
   but nevertheless distinguishable 
postwar environments 
one where 20 million people
are killed 
the other  150 million people killed 
you re talking about mass murder 
general  not war 
mr  president  i m not saying
we wouldn t get our hair mussed 
but i do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed  tops 
depending on the breaks 
i will not go down in history as the
greatest mass murderer since hitler 
it might be better
if you were more concerned   
it might be better
if you were more concerned   
   with the american people than
with your image in history books 
general turgidson  i ve heard
quite sufficient from you 
thank you very much 
mr  president  they have
the ambassador upstairs 
 oh  good  any difficulty 
 he s having a fit about the mps 
that can t be helped 
have him brought here 
yes  sir 
is that the russian ambassador 
yes  it is  general 
am i to understand
the russian ambassador   
   is to be admitted entrance
to the war room 
that is correct 
he is here on my orders 
i don t know exactly how
to put this  sir   
   but are you aware of what
a breach of security that would be 
i mean  he ll see everything 
he ll see the big board 
that is precisely the idea  general 
that is precisely the idea 
staines  get premier kissoff

punk vomit all over us like this 
mr  president 
they haven t reached premier kissoff 
they don t know where he is   
   and he won t be back
for another two hours 
 try b86543 moscow 
 yes  sir 
you d never have found him
through his office 
our premier is a man of the people 
but he is also a man  if you follow 
 degenerate  atheistic commie 
 what did you say 
i said  premier kissoff is
a degenerate  atheistic commie 
 have this ignorant fool  
 i m sorry 
mr  president 
i think they re trying the number 
gentlemen  you can t fight in here 
this is the war room 
gentlemen  you can t fight in here 
this is the war room 
what is going on here 
i demand an explanation 
this clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me 
you bet your sweets  mr  commie 
look at this 
this lousy commie rat was taking
pictures with this  of the big board 
mr  ambassador 
this clumsy fool attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me 
that s a damn lie 
i saw him with my own eyes 
this is outrageous  i have never heard
of such behavior in the war room 
mr  president  i think
they re getting him on the line 
you gotta hand it to
those commies 
yeah 
those trucks sure look like
the real thing  don t they 
i wonder
where they got them from 
probably bought them
from the army as war surplus 
okay  open up at 200 yards 
tell him where you are and that

about the possibility   
   of something going wrong
with the bomb 
the bomb  dimitri 
the hydrogen bomb 
well  now  what happened is   
   one of our base commanders 
he had a sort of  
well  he went a little funny
in the head 
you know  just a little funny 
you know  just a little funny 
and he went and did a silly thing 
well  i ll tell you what he did 
he ordered his planes   
   to attack your country 
well  let me finish  dimitri 
let me finish  dimitri 
well  listen  how do you think
i feel about it 
can you imagine how i feel
about it  dimitri 
why do you think i m calling you 
just to say hello 
of course i like to speak to you 
of course i like to say hello 
not now  but any time  dimitri 
i m just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened 
of course it s a friendly call 
listen  if it wasn t friendly  you
probably wouldn t have even got it 
they will not reach their targets
for at least another hour 
i am   i am positive  dimitri 
i ve been all over this
with your ambassador 
it is not a trick 
well  i ll tell you 
we d like to give your air staff
a complete rundown on the targets   
   the flight plans and the
defensive systems of the planes 
yes  i mean  if we re unable
to recall the planes   
   then i d say that  well   
   we re just gonna have to help you
destroy them  dimitri 
i know they re our boys 
all right  listen 
now  who should we call 
who should we call  dimitri 
sorry  you faded away there 
the people s central
air defense headquarters 
where is that  dimitri

so we re both sorry  all right 
all right 
yes  he s right here  yes  he wants
to talk to you  just a second 
what 
what  what is it  what 
the fools  the mad fools 
what s happened 
the doomsday machine 
the doom    the doomsday machine 
what is that 
a device which will destroy
all human and animal life on earth 
a device which will destroy
all human and animal life on earth 
all human and animal life 
 mandrake 
 yes  jack 
have you ever seen a commie
drink a glass of water 
well  no  i can t say i have  jack 
vodka  that s what they drink 
isn t it  never water 
well  i believe that s
what they drink  jack  yes 
on no account will a commie
ever drink water   
   and not without good reason 
oh  yes 
i can t quite see
what you re getting at  jack 
water 
that s what i m getting at  water 
mandrake  water is the source
of all life 
mandrake  water is the source
of all life 
seven tenths of this earth s surface
is water 
why  do you realize that   
   70 percent of you is water 
good lord 
and as human beings 
you and i need fresh  pure water   
   to replenish
our precious bodily fluids 
 you beginning to understand 
 yes 
mandrake    
mandrake  have you never wondered
why i drink only distilled water   
   or rainwater 
and only pure grain alcohol 
well  it did occur to me  jack  yes 
have you ever heard of a thing called
fluoridation  fluoridation of water 
yes  i have heard of that  jack  yes 
yes 
well  do you know what it is 
no  no  i don t know what it is  no 
do you realize that fluoridation   
   is the most
monstrously conceived   
   and dangerous communist plot
we have ever had to face 
two can play at that game  soldier 
that s nice shooting  soldier 
mandrake  come here 
you calling me  jack 
come over here
and help me with this belt 
i haven t had
very much experience   
   you know 
with those sort of machines  jack   
   i ve only ever pressed a button
in my old spitfire 
in the name of her majesty and the
continental congress  feed the belt 
jack  i d love to come 
but what s happened  you see   
   the string in my leg s gone 
 the what 
 the string  i never told you   
   but  you see  i ve got a gammy leg 
oh  dear  gone  shot off 
mandrake  come over here 
the redcoats are coming  come on 
when it is detonated  it will produce
enough radioactive fallout   
   so that in 10 months   
   the surface of the earth
will be as dead as the moon 
come on  de sadesky 
that s ridiculous 
our studies show
even the worst fallout   
   is down to a safe level
after two weeks 
you ve obviously never heard
of cobalt thorium g 
no  what about it 
cobalt thorium g has
a radioactive half life of 93 years 
if you take  say  50 h bombs
in the 100 megaton range   
   and jacket them
with cobalt thorium g   
   when they are exploded  they will
produce a doomsday shroud   
   a lethal cloud of radioactivity   
   which will encircle the earth
for 93 years 
what a load of commie bull 
i mean  after all    
i m afraid i don t understand
something  alexi 
is the premier threatening to
explode it if we carry out the attack 
no  it is not a thing
a sane man would do 
the doomsday machine is designed
to trigger itself automatically 
but surely you can
disarm it somehow 
no  it is designed to explode if
any attempt is made to un trigger it 
automatically 
it s a commie trick 
we re wasting valuable time 
look at the big board 
they re getting ready to clobber us 
but this is absolute madness 
why should you build such a thing 
some of us fought against it 
but we could not keep up with the
expense involved in the arms race   
   the space race
and the peace race 
at the same time 
our people grumbled   
at the same time 
our people grumbled   
   for more nylons
and washing machines 
our doomsday scheme cost us
a small fraction   
   of what we had been spending
on defense in a single year 
the deciding factor was
when we learned your country   
   was working along similar lines 
we were afraid of a doomsday gap 
this is preposterous  i ve never
approved of anything like that 
our source was
the new york times 
dr  strangelove  do we have anything
like that in the works 
a moment  please  mr  president 
under the authority granted me   
   as director of weapons research
and development   
   i commissioned last year
a study of this project   
   by the bland corporation 
   by the bland corporation 
based on the findings
of the report   
   my conclusion was that this idea
was not a practical deterrent   
   for reasons which at this moment
must be all too obvious 
then you mean it is possible
for them to have built such a thing 
mr  president  the technology required
is easily within the means   
   of even the smallest
nuclear power 
it requires only the will to do so 
but how is it possible for this thing
to be triggered automatically   
   and at the same time
impossible to un trigger 
mr  president 
it is not only possible   
   it is essential 
that is the whole idea
of this machine  you know 
deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy   
   the fear to attack 
and so because of the automated and
irrevocable decision making process   
   which rules out
human meddling   
   which rules out
human meddling   
   the doomsday machine
is terrifying 
this is simple to understand 
and completely credible
and convincing 
gee  i wish we had one of them
doomsday machines  stainesy 
but this is fantastic  strangelove 
how can it be triggered automatically 
well  it s remarkably simple
to do that 
when you merely wish
to bury bombs   
   there s no limit to the size 
after that  they are connected
to a gigantic complex of computers 
now  then  a specific and
clearly defined set of circumstances   
   under which the bombs
are to be exploded   
   is programmed into
a tape memory bank 
 a single role of tape can store    
 strangelove 
what kind of a name is that 
that ain t no kraut name  is it 
he changed it
when he became a citizen 
it used to be merkwürdigliebe 
well  a kraut by any other name 
huh  stainesy 
  is that the whole point of
the doomsday machine   
   is lost if you keep it a secret 
why didn t you tell the world 
it was to be announced
at the party congress on monday 
as you know 
the premier loves surprises 
stay with me  mandrake 
all right  mandrake  now feed me 
feed me bullets 
jack  don t you think we d be better off
away from all this flying glass 
no  we re okay here 
mandrake  do you realize that in
addition to fluoridating water  why   
   there are studies underway
to fluoridate salt  flour   
   fruit juices  soup  sugar 
milk  ice cream 
ice cream  mandrake 
 children s ice cream 
 good lord 
you know when fluoridation
first began 
no  i don t  jack 
1946 
1946  mandrake 
1946  mandrake 
how does that coincide with your
postwar commie conspiracy  huh 
it s incredibly obvious  isn t it 
a foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids   
   without the knowledge
of the individual 
certainly without any choice 
that s the way
a hard core commie works 
jack  listen  tell me  
tell me  jack 
when did you first become  
well  develop this theory 
well  i    
i first became aware of it 
mandrake   
   during the physical act of love 
yes  a profound sense of fatigue   
   a feeling of emptiness followed 
luckily  i was able to interpret
these feelings correctly 
loss of essence 
i can assure you it has not recurred 
mandrake 
women sense my power   
   and they seek the life essence 
 i do not avoid women  mandrake 
 no 
but i do deny them my essence 
yes  yes  jack 
cease fire 
my boys must have surrendered 
well  there it is 
now  jack  listen 
while there s still time  i beg you 
let s recall the wing and  
those boys were like my children 
mandrake 
 now they let me down 
 no  no  jack  not a bit of it 
no  i m sure they all gave it
their very best 
i m equally sure they all died
thinking of you   
   every man jack of them  jack 
supposing a bit of water
has gone off  eh 
one can never be too sure
about those things 
but you look at me 
do i look all rancid and clotted 
you look at me  jack  look 
and i drink a lot of water  you know 
i m what you might call a water man 
and i can swear to you 
my boy  swear to you   
   that there s nothing wrong with
my bodily fluids  not a thing  jackie 
mandrake  were you ever
a prisoner of war 
well  jack 
the time s running very  
 what 
 were you ever a prisoner of war 
yes  i was 
as a matter of fact  jack 
did they torture you 
yes  they did  i was tortured
by the japanese  if you must know 
 not a pretty story 
 what happened 
i don t know  jack  it s difficult
to think of under these conditions 
well  what happened was   
   they got me on the old
rangoon inchinawa railway 
i was laying train lines
for the bloody japanese puff puffs 
no  i mean  when they tortured you 
did you talk 
no  i    
well  i don t think they wanted me
to talk  really  or say anything 
it was their way of having
a bit of fun  the swines 
the strange thing is they make
such bloody good cameras 
those clowns outside
are gonna give me   
   a pretty good going over
in a few minutes for the code 
yes  
yes  well  you may have    
may have quite a point there  jack 
i don t know how well
i could stand up under torture 
well  of course  the answer to that is 
boy  no one ever does 
and my advice to you  jack 
is to give me the code now 
and if those devils come back
and try any rough stuff   
   we ll fight them together 
like we did just now on the floor 
you with your gun and me with a belt
and the ammo  feeding you 
 feed me   you said 
and i was feeding you  jack 
you know  mandrake   
   i happen to believe in a life
after this one   
   and i know i ll have to answer
for what i ve done 
and i think i can 
yes  well  of course you can  jack 
of course you can  you can 
i m a religious man myself 
you know  jack 
i believe in all that sort of thing
and i m hoping  you know  jack    
you ve dropped your gun  jack 
yes     you know what    
no  jack  let me take that for you 
i ll take that for you  jack 
you know what i m hoping  i m hoping
you re going to give me the code 
and   you re going to have a wash
and brush up  what a good idea 
always did wonders for a man 
a wash and brush up 
water on the back of the neck
makes you feel marvelous 
that s what we need 
water on the neck and the code 
now  supposing i play a little
guessing game with you  jack  boy 
i ll try and guess
what the code is  
copilot to navigator 
i m ready with the fuel figures now 
we have 109 000 total   
   79 000 in the mains   
   and 30 000 in the auxiliaries 
and that works out
to roughly   
   seven hours  15 minutes

where s general ripper 
he s dead  in the bathroom 
 where s the bathroom 
 next to you 
i don t know what stupid game
you re playing   
   but i ve got an idea
what the recall code is 
i have to get in touch
with sac headquarters 
i said  put your hands over your head
and keep them there  go on 
 got any witnesses 
 witnesses 
what are you talking about 
he shot himself 
while he was shaving  huh 
now  look  colonel  bat  guano 
if that really is your name   
   may i tell you that i have
a very  very good idea   
   i think  i hope  i pray 
what the recall code is 
it s some theme he kept repeating 
a variation on  peace on earth 
or  purity of essence   one of those 
put your hands up on top of
your head  start walking 
don t you know that general ripper
went mad   
   and sent the whole wing
to attack the soviets 
 what are you talking about 
 i ll tell you what i m talking about 
i m gonna pick up this red telephone 
which is connected to sac   
   and i hope  
blast  blast 
shot away  i expect  by one of your
men during this ridiculous fighting 
right 
all right  charlie  i ve been
wasting too much time on you 
i got a lot of wounded men outside 
start walking 
all the radio gear is out 
including the crm 114 
i think the auto destruct mechanism
got hit and blew itself up 
the fire is out 
the emergency power is on 
everything seems to
check out all right  will advise 
roger  navigator 
i ve worked out our rate of fuel loss
at approximately 162 per minute 
this gives us a radius of action
sufficient to take out   
   primary and secondary targets 
but we will not   
   repeat  not be able to make it back
to any base or neutral country 
however  we would have enough fuel
to ditch at weather ship tango delta   
however  we would have enough fuel

   grid coordinates 003 691 
well  boys 
we got three engines out   
   we got more holes in us
than a horse trader s mule   
   the radio is gone
and we re leaking fuel 
if we was flying any lower 
we d need sleigh bells on this thing 
but we got one little budge
on them russkies 
at this height 
they might harpoon us   
   but they sure ain t gonna spot us
on no radar screen 
the other way 
 where are you taking me 
 to the main gate 
colonel 
colonel  i must know what you think
has been going on here 
 you wanna know what i think 
 yes 
i think you re some kind
of deviated  prevert  
i think ripper found out
about your  preversion    
   and that you were organizing some
kind of mutiny of preverts  now  move 
i don t know anything
about any planes attacking russia 
i was told get ripper on the phone
with the president of the united states 
now  just one second 
you just said   the president  
what about the president 
the president wants to speak
to general ripper  doesn t he 
now  general ripper is dead 
is he not 
i am general ripper s
executive officer   
   so the president will want
to speak to me  won t he 
there s a telephone box over there
and the line may be open 
you wanna talk to
the president of the united states 
i don t want to talk to him 
i ve got to talk to him 
and if you don t put that gun away
and stop this stupid nonsense   
   the court of inquiry on this
will give you such a pranging   
   you ll be lucky to end up wearing the
uniform of a bloody toilet attendant 
okay  go ahead 
try and get the president
of the united states on the phone 
if you try any preversions in there 
i ll blow your head off 
operator  this is
group captain lionel mandrake 
i m speaking from
burpelson air force base 
something urgent has come up and i
want you to place an emergency call   
   with president merkin muffley
in the pentagon  washington  d c 
burpelson 39180 
no  i m perfectly serious 
the president of the united states 
no  i m perfectly serious 
the president of the united states 
oh  i m sorry 
i haven t got enough change 
could you make this
a collect call  operator 
just one second  operator 
they won t accept the call 
have you got 55 cents 
you don t think i d go into combat with
loose change in my pocket  do you 
operator  look 
is it possible to make this
an ordinary trunk call 
well  what do you call it 
you know    
oh  station to station 
oh  blast 
i m still 20 cents short 
operator  hold on 
i shan t keep you a second 
colonel  that coca cola machine 
i want you to shoot the lock off it

that s private property 
can you possibly imagine
what is gonna happen to you   
   your frame  outlook 
way of life and everything   
   when they learn you have obstructed
a telephone call to the president 
can you imagine 
shoot it off  shoot with the gun 
that s what the bullets are for

mr  president 
i m not a sentimentalist
by nature   
   but i think i know
what s in every heart in this room 
i think we ought to all
just bow our heads   
   and give a short prayer of thanks
for our deliverance  lord   
   we have heard the wings
of the angel of death   
   fluttering over our heads
from the valley of fear 
you have seen fit to deliver us
from the forces of evil  
excuse me  sir 
premier kissoff s calling again
and he s hopping mad 
fuel flow on active engines
and leakage has increased 
now works out at 205 
estimate remaining fuel
at 8790 
roger  confirm 205 per minute   
   and remaining fuel 8790 
no  no  dimitri 
there must be some mistake 
no  i m certain of that 
i m perfectly certain
of that  dimitri 
just a second 
you know what he says 
he says one of the planes
hasn t turned back 
according to information
forwarded by our air staffs   
   it s headed for
the missile complex at laputa 
that s impossible  mr  president 
i mean  look at the big board 
thirty four planes  30 recalls
acknowledged and four splashes   
   and one of them
was targeted for laputa 
dimitri  look  we ve got an
acknowledgment from every plane   
   except the four
you ve shot down 
he   hang on a second  dimitri 
he says their air defense now only
claims three aircraft confirmed 
the fourth may only be damaged 
mr  president  i m beginning to smell
a big  fat  commie rat 
i mean  supposing kissoff
is lying about that fourth plane   
   just looking for an excuse
to clobber us 
if the spaghetti hits the fan now 
we re in trouble 
dimitri  look 
if this report is true   
   and the plane manages
to bomb the target   
   is this gonna set off
the doomsday machine 
are you sure 
well  i guess you re just gonna have
to get that plane  dimitri 
i m sorry they re jamming
your radar and flying so low   
   but they re trained to do it 
you know  it s initiative 
look  dimitri  you know
exactly where they re going   
   and i m sure your entire air defense
can stop a single plane 
listen  it s not gonna help
either one of us   
   if the doomsday machine
goes off  now  is it 
dimitri  there s no point in you getting
hysterical at a moment like this 
dimitri  keep your feet on the ground
while you re talking  dimitri 
i am not   i am not getting  
no  dimitri  i m just worried 
that s all 
look  if our air staff say
its primary target is laputa   
   and its secondary target is
borchov  i mean  it s true  dimitri 
you ve gotta believe it 
look  can i    dimitri  can i give
you just one word   
can i give you just one word
of advice  dimitri 
listen  dimitri 
put everything you ve got into those
two sectors and you can t miss 
sir  if we continue to lose fuel
at the present rate   
   i estimate we only have
38 minutes flying time   
   which will not even take us
as far as the primary 
doggone it  sweets  you told me
that you could get me to the primary 
i m sorry  sir  that estimate was based
on the original loss rate factor   
   not at 205 
i don t give a hoot in hell
how you do it   
   just get me to the primary 
you hear 
   just get me to the primary 
you hear 
i m sorry  sir 
but those are the figures 
we ll be lucky to reach
weather ship at tango delta 
well  shoot 
we ain t come this far just
to dump this thing in the drink 
what s the nearest target
of opportunity 
sir  if the rate of loss
does not increase   
   we have a chance
to reach target 384   
   grid coordinate 003 691   
   and possibly make it from there
to the tango delta weather ship 
what kind of a target
is that  anyhow 
sir  that s the icbm
complex at kotloss 
all right 
designating new target  384 
give me a heading on that as soon
as you get it worked out 
well  we ll keep our fingers crossed 
remember  we re all in this together 
we re right behind you 
we re with you all the way 
yes  well  we ll keep the line open 
all right  dimitri 
general turgidson  is there really
a chance for that plane to get through 
mr  president 
if i may speak freely 
the russki talks big  but frankly 
we think he s short of know how 
you can t expect ignorant peons to
understand a machine like our boys 
and that s not meant as an insult 
we all know how much guts
the average russki s got 
look at all of them the nazis
killed off  they still wouldn t quit 
can t you stick to the point 
well  sir  if the pilot s good 
see  
i mean  if he s really sharp 
he can barrel that baby in so low 
you ought to see it  it s a sight 
a big plane  like a  52   
   its jet exhaust frying chickens
in the barnyard 
 yeah  but has he got a chance 
 has he got a chance 
hell  ye

where in hell is major kong 
what about major kong 
mr  president  i would not
rule out the chance   
mr  president  i would not
rule out the chance   
   to preserve a nucleus
of human specimens 
it would be quite easy   
   at the bottom of some
of our deeper mineshafts 
the radioactivity would not penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep 
and in a matter of weeks  sufficient
improvements in dwelling space   
   could easily be provided 
how long would you have
to stay down there 
well  let s see now    
cobalt thorium g 
radioactive half life of    
i would think that    
possibly 100 years 
you mean people could actually
stay down there for 100 years 
it would not be difficult 
mein führer 
nuclear reactors could  
i m sorry  mr  president 
nuclear reactors could provide
power almost indefinitely 
greenhouses could maintain
plant life 
animals could be bred
and slaughtered 
a quick survey would have
to be made   
   of the available mine sites
in the country 
but i would guess
that a dwelling space   
   for several hundred thousand of
our people could easily be provided 
well  i would hate
to have to decide   
   who stays up
and who goes down 
well  that would not be necessary 
mr  president 
it could easily be accomplished
with a computer 
the computer could
be set and programmed   
   to accept factors
from youth  health   
   sexual fertility  intelligence   
   and a cross section
of necessary skills 
of course  it would be
absolutely vital   
   that our top government
and military men be included   
   that our top government
and military men be included   
   to foster and impart the required
principles of leadership and tradition 
naturally  they would breed
prodigiously 
there would be much time
and little to do 
but with the proper breeding
techniques and a ratio of  say   
    10 females to each male   
   they could then work their way back
to the present gross national product   
   within  say  20 years 
but look here  doctor 
wouldn t this nucleus of survivors   
   be so grief stricken
and anguished that they d   
   well  envy the dead
and not wanna go on living 
no  sir  excuse me 
no  sir  when they go down into the
mine  everyone would still be alive 
there would be
no shocking memories   
   the prevailing emotion will be one
of nostalgia for those left behind   
   combined with a spirit of bold
curiosity for the adventure ahead 
doctor   
   you mentioned the ratio
of 10 women to each man 
now  wouldn t that necessitate
the abandonment   
   of the so called
monogamous sexual relationship 
i mean  as far as men
were concerned 
i mean  as far as men
were concerned 
regrettably  yes 
but it is  you know  a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race 
i hasten to add that since each man
will be required to do prodigious   
   service along these lines   
   the women will have to be selected
for their sexual characteristics   
   which will have to be of
a highly stimulating nature 
i must confess  you have an
astonishingly good idea there  doctor 
thank you  sir 
i think we ought to look at this from
the military point of view  i mean    
supposing the russkies stashed away
some big bombs  see  and we didn t 
when they come out in 100 years 
they could take over 
i agree  mr  president 
they might try a sneak attack so they
could take over our mineshaft space 
it d be extremely naive of us to imagine
that these new developments   
   are gonna cause any change
in soviet expansionist policy 
i mean  we must be
increasingly on the alert   
   to prevent them from taking over
mineshaft space   
   in order to breed more
than we do   
   thus knocking us out through
