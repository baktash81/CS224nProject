western leaders
that the soviet union had been at
work on what was hinted to be
the ultimate weapon
a doomsday device
intelligence sources traced the site
of the topsecret russian project
to the perpetually fogshrouded
wasteland
below the arctic peaks
of the zhokhov islands
below the arctic peaks
of the zhokhov islands
what they were building
or why it should be located in such
a remote and desolate place
no one could say
general ripper sir
group captain mandrake speaking
this is general ripper speaking
yes sir
do you recognize my voice
i do sir why do you ask
why do you think i ask
well i dont know sir we spoke
just a few moments ago didnt we
you dont think id ask unless it was
pretty damned important do you
no i dont sir no
lets see if we can stay on the ball
has the wing confirmed holding
at their failsafe points
yes sir the confirmations
have all just come in
very well
now listen to me carefully
the base is being
put on condition red
i want this flashed
to all sections immediately
condition red jolly good idea
keeps the men on their toes
im afraid this is not an exercise
not an exercise sir
i shouldnt tell you this but youre a
good officer and have a right to know
it looks like
were in a shooting war
oh hell
are the russians involved
thats all ive been told
it came in on the red phone im gonna
follow orders and seal this base tight
now i want you to
transmit plan r
r for robert to the wing
plan r for robert
is it that bad sir
looks like its pretty hairy
yes sir
plan r for robert sir
now last and possibly
most important
i want all privatelyowned radios
to be immediately impounded
they might be used to issue
instructions to saboteurs
as i previously arranged air police
will have lists of all owners
i want every single one of them
collected without exception
after youve done that
report back to me
in order to guard against
surprise nuclear attack
americas
strategic air command
maintains a large force
of b52 bombers
airborne 24 hours a day
each b52 can deliver a nuclear
bomb load of 50 megatons
equal to 16 times the total explosive
force of all the bombs and shells
used by all the armies
in world war ll
based in america
the airborne alert force
is deployed from the persian gulf
to the arctic ocean
but they have one geographical factor
in common
they are all two hours
from their targets inside russia
major kong i know youll think
this is crazy
but i just got a message from base
over the crm 114
it decodes as wing attack plan r
r for romeo
goldie did you say
wing attack plan r
goldie did you say
wing attack plan r
yes sir i have
goldie how many times have
i told you guys
that i dont want
no horsing around on the airplane
im not horsing around sir
thats how it decodes
well ive been to one world fair
a picnic and a rodeo
and thats the stupidest thing
i ever heard over earphones
you sure you got todays code
yes sir it is
theres just gotta be
something wrong
wait a second im coming back
maybe youd better get
a confirmation from base
yes sir
major kong is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test
give the go code and then recall
to see who would actually go
aint nobody ever got
the go code yet
aint nobody ever got
the go code yet
old ripper wouldnt be giving us
plan r
unless them russkies had
clobbered washington
and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack
yes sir
major kong message
from base confirmed
well boys i reckon this is it
nuclear combat toetotoe
with the russkies
now look boys i aint much
of a hand at making speeches
but i got a pretty fair idea
that something doggone important
is going on back there
now ive got a fair idea of the kind
of personal emotions
that some of you fellows
may be thinking
heck i reckon you wouldnt even be
human beings
if you didnt have strong personal
feelings about nuclear combat
but i want you to remember
one thing
that folks back home
is counting on you
and by golly
we aint about to let them down
tell you something else
if this thing turns out to be half as
important as i figure it just might be
id say that youre all in line
for some important promotions
and personal citations
when this things over with
and that goes for
every last one of you
regardless of your race
color or your creed
now lets get this thing on the hump
we got some flying to do
buck should i get it
yeah you have to
hello
yes general turgidson is here
he cant come
to the phone at the moment
well this is his secretary
miss scott
freddie how are you
fine and you
oh we were just catching up
on some of the generals paperwork
well look freddie hes tied up
at the moment
im afraid
he cant come to the phone
just a minute
general turgidson
a colonel puntrich calling
tell him to call back
freddie the general says could you
call back in a minute or two
he says it cant wait
for petes
find out what he wants
freddie the thing is the general
is in the powder room right now
could you tell me what its about
just a second
apparently they monitored
a transmission eight minutes ago
from burpelson air force base
right it was directed to the
843rd bomb wing on airborne alert
it decoded as wing attack plan r
well tell him to call whatshisname
the base commander ripper
do i have to think of everything
the general suggests you call general
ripper the 843rd base commander
all communications are dead
bull tell him to do it himself
freddie the general asks if
you could possibly try again yourself
i see he says hes tried personally
several times but everything is dead
even the normal phone lines
are shut down
fred buck whats it look like
yeah
well are you sure its plan r
whats cooking on the threat board
nothing nothing at all
i dont like the look of this fred
tell you what you better do
old buddy
give elmo and charlie a blast
bump everything up to condition red
stand by the blower
ill get back to you
whats up
nothing nothing
wheres my shorts
on the floor where are you going
no place
i thought i might mosey over to the
war room see whats doing over there
its 300 in the morning
the air force never sleeps
buck honey im not sleepy either
i know how it is baby
tell you what you do
you just start your countdown
and old bucky will be back here
before you can say blastoff
your commie has no regard
for human life not even his own
and for this reason men
i want to impress upon you
the need
for extreme watchfulness
the enemy may come individually
or he may come in strength
he may even come in the uniform
of our own troops
but however he comes
we must stop him
we must not allow him
to gain entrance to this base
now i am going to give you
three simple rules
first trust no one
whatever his uniform or rank
unless he is known
to you personally
second anyone or anything
that approaches within 200 yards
of the perimeter is to be fired upon
third if in doubt shoot first
and ask questions afterwards
i would sooner accept
a few casualties through accident
than lose the entire base and
its personnel through carelessness
any variation on these rules
must come from me personally
now men in conclusion
i would like to say
that in the two years
it has been my privilege
to be your commanding officer
i have always expected
the best from you
and you have never given me
anything less than that
today the nation is counting on us
we are not going to let them down
good luck to you all
heres the attack profile sir
this is your attack profile
to ensure that the enemy cannot
monitor voice transmission
or plant false transmission
the crm 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits
the emergency base code prefix
is to be set
on the dials of the crm
this will block any transmission other
than those preceded by a code prefix
stand by to set code prefix

excuse me sir something rather
interesting has just cropped up
listen to that music
civilian broadcasting
i think the pentagon has given us
an exercise to test our readiness
i think its taking things too far
our fellows will be inside russian
radar cover in 20 minutes
listen to that chockablock
full of stations all churning it out
mandrake
yes sir
i thought i issued instructions
for all radios to be impounded
you did and i was in the process of
impounding this when i switched it on
i thought our fellows hitting russian
radar dropping all their stuff
id better tell you because if
they do itll cause a bit of a stink
group captain
the officerexchange program
does not give you any special
prerogatives to question my orders
i realize that sir but i thought youd
be rather pleased to hear the news
i mean after all
well lets face it
we dont want to start a nuclear war
unless we really have to do we
please sit down
and turn that thing off
yes sir
what about the planes
surely we must issue
the recall code immediately
group captain the planes
are not gonna be recalled
my attack orders have been issued
and the orders stand
if youll excuse me saying so sir
that would be to my way of thinking
rather an odd way
of looking at it
if a russian attack
was in progress
we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting
are you certain of that
im absolutely positive
and what if it is true
im afraid im still not with you sir
because i mean
if a russian attack
was not in progress
then your use of plan r in fact
your orders to the entire wing
i would say that there was something
dreadfully wrong somewhere
why dont you take it easy
group captain
please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater
and help yourself
to whatever youd like
general ripper sir as an officer
in her majestys air force
it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances
to issue the recall code upon my
own authority and bring back the wing
if youll excuse me sir
sir i must ask you for the key
and the recall code
have you got them handy
i told you to take it easy
group captain
theres nothing anybody can do
about this now
im the only person who knows
the code group
then i must insist sir
that you give them to me
do i take it sir you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun
mandrake i suppose
it never occurred to you
that while were chatting here
so enjoyably
a decision is being made
by the president
and the joint chiefs in the war room
at the pentagon
and when they realize there is
no possibility of recalling the wing
there will be only one course
of action open
total commitment
mandrake do you recall what
clemenceau once said about war
no i dont think i do sir no
he said war was too important
to be left to the generals
when he said that 50 years ago
when he said that 50 years ago
he might have been right
but today
war is too important
to be left to politicians
they have neither the time
the training
nor the inclination
for strategic thought
i can no longer sit back
and allow
communist infiltration
communist indoctrination
communist subversion
and the international
communist conspiracy
to sap and impurify
all of our precious bodily fluids
staines is everybody here
mr president the secretary of state
is in vietnam
the secretary of defense is in laos
the vice president is in mexico city
we can establish contact with them
at any time
the undersecretaries are all here
right now general turgidson
whats going on here
mr president
about 35 minutes ago
general jack ripper
the commanding general
general jack ripper
the commanding general
of burpelson air force base
issued an order to the 34 b52s
of his wing
which were airborne
at the time
as part of a special exercise we were
holding called operation dropkick
now it appears that the order
called for the planes
to attack their targets
inside russia
the planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons
with an average load
of 40 megatons each
now the central display of russia will
indicate the position of the planes
the triangles
are their primary targets
the squares
are their secondary targets
the aircraft will begin penetrating
russian radar cover within 25 minutes
general turgidson i find this
very difficult to understand
i was under the impression
i was the only one in authority
to order the use of
nuclear weapons
thats right sir you are
the only person authorized to do so
and although i hate to judge
before all the facts are in
its beginning to look like
general ripper exceeded his authority
it certainly does far beyond the point
i would have imagined possible
well perhaps youre forgetting
the provisions of plan r sir
plan r
plan r is an emergency war plan
in which a lowerechelon
commander may order
nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack
if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted
you approved it sir
you must remember
surely you must recall sir
when senator beaufort
made that big hassle about
our deterrent lacking credibility
the idea was for plan r to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard
a safeguard
i admit the human element
seems to have failed us here
but the idea was to discourage
the russkies from any hope
they could knock out washington
and yourself
as part of a sneak attack
and escape retaliation because of
lack of proper command and control
and escape retaliation because of
lack of proper command and control
i assume the planes will return
automatically
once they reach their
failsafe points
no sir im afraid not the planes
were holding at their failsafe points
when the go code was issued
once they fly beyond failsafe they do
not require a second order to proceed
they will continue
until they reach their target
then why havent you radioed the
planes countermanding the go code
im afraid were unable to
communicate with any of the aircraft
why
as you may recall sir
one of the provisions
of plan r provides
that once the go code
is received
the normal ssb radios
in the aircraft
are switched into
a special coded device
which i believe is designated
as crm 114
now in order
to prevent the enemy
from issuing fake
or confusing orders
crm 114 is designed
not to receive at all
unless the message is preceded
by the correct threeletter
code group prefix
do you mean to tell me general you
will be unable to recall the aircraft
thats the size of it
however we are plowing through
every possible threeletter
combination of the code
but since there are
17000 permutations
its going to take us about two days
to transmit them all
how soon will planes penetrate
russian radar cover
eighteen minutes from now
are you in contact with ripper
no sir general ripper sealed off
the base and cut off communications
where did you get this information
general ripper called
strategic air command headquarters
shortly after he issued the go code
i have a portion of the transcript
if youd like me to read it
read it
the duty officer asked
general ripper
to confirm the fact that he had
issued the go code and he said
yes gentlemen they are on their way
in and no one can bring them back
for the sake of our country
and our way of life
i suggest you get the rest of sac
in after them
otherwise we will be totally destroyed
by red retaliation
my boys will give you the best kind
of start 1400 megatons worth
and you sure as hell
wont stop them now
so lets get going
theres no other choice
god willing we will prevail
in peace and freedom from fear
and in true health
through the purity
and essence of our natural
fluids
god bless you all
then he hung up
were still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase
theres nothing to figure out
this man is obviously a psychotic
id like to hold off judgment on a thing
like that sir until all the facts are in
general turgidson when you
instituted the human reliability tests
you assured me there was
no possibility
of such a thing ever occurring
well i dont think its quite fair
to condemn the whole program
because of a single slipup sir
because of a single slipup sir
i wanna speak to general ripper
on the telephone
im afraid thats impossible
general turgidson i am becoming
less and less interested
in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible
general faceman
yes sir
are there any army units
stationed near burpelson
ill just check sir
hello
i told you never to call me here
dont you know where i am
look baby i cant talk to you now
my president needs me
of course bucky would rather
be there with you
of course it isnt only physical
i deeply respect you
as a human being
someday im gonna make you
mrs buck turgidson
oh listen you go back to sleep
bucky will be back there
just as soon as he can
all right listen sug
dont forget to say your prayers
apparently
the 23rd airborne division
is stationed seven miles away
at alvarado
general faceman i want them to enter
the base locate general ripper
and put him
in immediate contact with me
yes sir
mr president if i may advise
under a condition red it is standard
procedure the base be sealed off
and the base defended
by base security troops
any force trying to enter there would
certainly encounter heavy casualties
general turgidson with all due
respect for your defense team
my boys can brush them aside
without too much trouble
mr president there are one or two
points id like to make if i may
go ahead general
one our hopes for recalling
the 843rd bomb wing
are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability
two in less than 15 minutes
from now
the russkies will be making
radar contact with the planes
three when they do
they will go absolutely ape and
strike back with everything theyve got
four if prior to this time
we have done nothing to suppress
their retaliatory capabilities
we will suffer virtual annihilation
now
five
if on the other hand
we immediately launched an attack
on their airfields and missile bases
wed stand a good chance of
catching them with their pants down
weve got a 5to1
missile superiority
we could easily assign three missiles
to every target
and still have an effective reserve
force for any other contingency
six an unofficial study which
we undertook of this eventuality
indicated that we would destroy
90 percent of their nuclear capabilities
we would therefore prevail
and suffer only modest civilian
casualties from their remaining force
which would be badly damaged
and uncoordinated
general it is the avowed policy
of our country
never to strike first
with nuclear weapons
never to strike first
with nuclear weapons
well mr president id say ripper
has already invalidated that policy
that was not an act of national policy
there are still alternatives open to us
mr president
we are rapidly approaching
a moment of truth
both for ourselves
and for the life of our nation
now truth is not always
a pleasant thing
but it is necessary now
to make a choice
to choose between two
admittedly regrettable
but nevertheless distinguishable
postwar environments
one where 20 million people
are killed
the other 150 million people killed
youre talking about mass murder
general not war
mr president im not saying
we wouldnt get our hair mussed
but i do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed tops
depending on the breaks
i will not go down in history as the
greatest mass murderer since hitler
it might be better
if you were more concerned
it might be better
if you were more concerned
with the american people than
with your image in history books
general turgidson ive heard
quite sufficient from you
thank you very much
mr president they have
the ambassador upstairs
oh good any difficulty
hes having a fit about the mps
that cant be helped
have him brought here
yes sir
is that the russian ambassador
yes it is general
am i to understand
the russian ambassador
is to be admitted entrance
to the war room
that is correct
he is here on my orders
i dont know exactly how
to put this sir
but are you aware of what
a breach of security that would be
i mean hell see everything
hell see the big board
that is precisely the idea general
that is precisely the idea
staines get premier kissoff
on the hot line
survival kit contents check
survival kit contents check
in them you will find
one 45caliber automatic

ill see to it right away
try one of these jamaican cigars
ambassador theyre good
thank you no i do not support
the work of imperialist stooges
oh only commie stooges huh
mr president
youre gonna let that lousy commie
punk vomit all over us like this
mr president
they havent reached premier kissoff
they dont know where he is
and he wont be back
for another two hours
try b86543 moscow
yes sir
youd never have found him
through his office
our premier is a man of the people
but he is also a man if you follow
degenerate atheistic commie
what did you say
i said premier kissoff is
a degenerate atheistic commie
have this ignorant fool
im sorry
mr president
i think theyre trying the number
gentlemen you cant fight in here
this is the war room
gentlemen you cant fight in here
this is the war room
what is going on here
i demand an explanation
this clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me
you bet your sweets mr commie
look at this
this lousy commie rat was taking
pictures with this of the big board
mr ambassador
this clumsy fool attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me
thats a damn lie
i saw him with my own eyes
this is outrageous i have never heard
of such behavior in the war room
mr president i think
theyre getting him on the line
you gotta hand it to
those commies
yeah
those trucks sure look like
the real thing dont they
i wonder
where they got them from
probably bought them
from the army as war surplus
okay open up at 200 yards
tell him where you are and that
youll speak if i say anything untrue
but please dont tell him
anything more than that
alexi alexi please i beg you
but i dont have a phone
but i dont have a phone
give him your phone frank
ive done as you asked
be careful i think he is drunk
hello hello dimitri
listen i cant hear too well
do you suppose you could
turn the music down just a little
oh thats much better
yeah yes
fine i can hear you now dimitri
clear and plain
and coming through fine
im coming through fine too
good then
well then as you say
were both coming through fine good
well its good that youre fine
and im fine
i agree with you
its great to be fine
now then dimitri
you know how weve always talked
about the possibility
of something going wrong
with the bomb
the bomb dimitri
the hydrogen bomb
well now what happened is
one of our base commanders
he had a sort of
well he went a little funny
in the head
you know just a little funny
you know just a little funny
and he went and did a silly thing
well ill tell you what he did
he ordered his planes
to attack your country
well let me finish dimitri
let me finish dimitri
well listen how do you think
i feel about it
can you imagine how i feel
about it dimitri
why do you think im calling you
just to say hello
of course i like to speak to you
of course i like to say hello
not now but any time dimitri
im just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened
of course its a friendly call
listen if it wasnt friendly you
probably wouldnt have even got it
they will not reach their targets
for at least another hour
i am i am positive dimitri
ive been all over this
with your ambassador
it is not a trick
well ill tell you
wed like to give your air staff
a complete rundown on the targets
the flight plans and the
defensive systems of the planes
yes i mean if were unable
to recall the planes
then id say that well
were just gonna have to help you
destroy them dimitri
i know theyre our boys
all right listen
now who should we call
who should we call dimitri
sorry you faded away there
the peoples central
air defense headquarters
where is that dimitri
in omsk right
yes
oh youll call them first will you
do you happen to have
the phone number on you dimitri
what i see
just ask for omsk information
im sorry too dimitri
im very sorry
all right youre sorrier than i am
but i am sorry as well
i am as sorry as you are dimitri
dont say that youre more sorry
because im capable of being
just as sorry as you are
so were both sorry all right
all right
yes hes right here yes he wants
to talk to you just a second
what
what what is it what
the fools the mad fools
whats happened
the doomsday machine
the doom the doomsday machine
what is that
a device which will destroy
all human and animal life on earth
a device which will destroy
all human and animal life on earth
all human and animal life
mandrake
yes jack
have you ever seen a commie
drink a glass of water
well no i cant say i have jack
vodka thats what they drink
isnt it never water
well i believe thats
what they drink jack yes
on no account will a commie
ever drink water
and not without good reason
oh yes
i cant quite see
what youre getting at jack
water
thats what im getting at water
mandrake water is the source
of all life
mandrake water is the source
of all life
seventenths of this earths surface
is water
why do you realize that
70 percent of you is water
good lord
and as human beings
you and i need fresh pure water
to replenish
our precious bodily fluids
you beginning to understand
yes
mandrake
mandrake have you never wondered
why i drink only distilled water
or rainwater
and only pure grain alcohol
well it did occur to me jack yes
have you ever heard of a thing called
fluoridation fluoridation of water
yes i have heard of that jack yes
yes
well do you know what it is
no no i dont know what it is no
do you realize that fluoridation
is the most
monstrously conceived
and dangerous communist plot
we have ever had to face
two can play at that game soldier
thats nice shooting soldier
mandrake come here
you calling me jack
come over here
and help me with this belt
i havent had
very much experience
you know
with those sort of machines jack
ive only ever pressed a button
in my old spitfire
in the name of her majesty and the
continental congress feed the belt
jack id love to come
but whats happened you see
the string in my legs gone
the what
the string i never told you
but you see ive got a gammy leg
oh dear gone shot off
mandrake come over here
the redcoats are coming come on
when it is detonated it will produce
enough radioactive fallout
so that in 10 months
the surface of the earth
will be as dead as the moon
come on de sadesky
thats ridiculous
our studies show
even the worst fallout
is down to a safe level
after two weeks
youve obviously never heard
of cobalt thorium g
no what about it
cobalt thorium g has
a radioactive halflife of 93 years
if you take say 50 h bombs
in the 100 megaton range
and jacket them
with cobalt thorium g
when they are exploded they will
produce a doomsday shroud
a lethal cloud of radioactivity
which will encircle the earth
for 93 years
what a load of commie bull
i mean after all
im afraid i dont understand
something alexi
is the premier threatening to
explode it if we carry out the attack
no it is not a thing
a sane man would do
the doomsday machine is designed
to trigger itself automatically
but surely you can
disarm it somehow
no it is designed to explode if
any attempt is made to untrigger it
automatically
its a commie trick
were wasting valuable time
look at the big board
theyre getting ready to clobber us
but this is absolute madness
why should you build such a thing
some of us fought against it
but we could not keep up with the
expense involved in the arms race
the space race
and the peace race
at the same time
our people grumbled
at the same time
our people grumbled
for more nylons
and washing machines
our doomsday scheme cost us
a small fraction
of what we had been spending
on defense in a single year
the deciding factor was
when we learned your country
was working along similar lines
we were afraid of a doomsday gap
this is preposterous ive never
approved of anything like that
our source was
the new york times
dr strangelove do we have anything
like that in the works
a moment please mr president
under the authority granted me
as director of weapons research
and development
i commissioned last year
a study of this project
by the bland corporation
by the bland corporation
based on the findings
of the report
my conclusion was that this idea
was not a practical deterrent
for reasons which at this moment
must be all too obvious
then you mean it is possible
for them to have built such a thing
mr president the technology required
is easily within the means
of even the smallest
nuclear power
it requires only the will to do so
but how is it possible for this thing
to be triggered automatically
and at the same time
impossible to untrigger
mr president
it is not only possible
it is essential
that is the whole idea
of this machine you know
deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy
the fear to attack
and so because of the automated and
irrevocable decisionmaking process
which rules out
human meddling
which rules out
human meddling
the doomsday machine
is terrifying
this is simple to understand
and completely credible
and convincing
gee i wish we had one of them
doomsday machines stainesy
but this is fantastic strangelove
how can it be triggered automatically
well its remarkably simple
to do that
when you merely wish
to bury bombs
theres no limit to the size
after that they are connected
to a gigantic complex of computers
now then a specific and
clearlydefined set of circumstances
under which the bombs
are to be exploded
is programmed into
a tape memory bank
a single role of tape can store
strangelove
what kind of a name is that
that aint no kraut name is it
he changed it
when he became a citizen
it used to be merkwürdigliebe
well a kraut by any other name
huh stainesy
is that the whole point of
the doomsday machine
is lost if you keep it a secret
why didnt you tell the world
it was to be announced
at the party congress on monday
as you know
the premier loves surprises
stay with me mandrake
all right mandrake now feed me
feed me bullets
jack dont you think wed be better off
away from all this flying glass
no were okay here
mandrake do you realize that in
addition to fluoridating water why
there are studies underway
to fluoridate salt flour
fruit juices soup sugar
milk ice cream
ice cream mandrake
childrens ice cream
good lord
you know when fluoridation
first began
no i dont jack
1946 mandrake
1946 mandrake
how does that coincide with your
postwar commie conspiracy huh
its incredibly obvious isnt it
a foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids
without the knowledge
of the individual
certainly without any choice
thats the way
a hardcore commie works
jack listen tell me
tell me jack
when did you first become
well develop this theory
well i
i first became aware of it
mandrake
during the physical act of love
yes a profound sense of fatigue
a feeling of emptiness followed
luckily i was able to interpret
these feelings correctly
loss of essence
i can assure you it has not recurred
mandrake
women sense my power
and they seek the life essence
i do not avoid women mandrake
no
but i do deny them my essence
yes yes jack
cease fire
my boys must have surrendered
well there it is
now jack listen
while theres still time i beg you
lets recall the wing and
those boys were like my children
mandrake
now they let me down
no no jack not a bit of it
no im sure they all gave it
their very best
im equally sure they all died
thinking of you
every man jack of them jack
supposing a bit of water
has gone off eh
one can never be too sure
about those things
but you look at me
do i look all rancid and clotted
you look at me jack look
and i drink a lot of water you know
im what you might call a water man
and i can swear to you
my boy swear to you
that theres nothing wrong with
my bodily fluids not a thing jackie
mandrake were you ever
a prisoner of war
well jack
the times running very
what
were you ever a prisoner of war
yes i was
as a matter of fact jack
did they torture you
yes they did i was tortured
by the japanese if you must know
not a pretty story
what happened
i dont know jack its difficult
to think of under these conditions
well what happened was
they got me on the old
rangooninchinawa railway
i was laying train lines
for the bloody japanese puffpuffs
no i mean when they tortured you
did you talk
no i
well i dont think they wanted me
to talk really or say anything
it was their way of having
a bit of fun the swines
the strange thing is they make
such bloody good cameras
those clowns outside
are gonna give me
a pretty good goingover
in a few minutes for the code
yes
yes well you may have
may have quite a point there jack
i dont know how well
i could stand up under torture
well of course the answer to that is
boy no one ever does
and my advice to you jack
is to give me the code now
and if those devils come back
and try any rough stuff
well fight them together
like we did just now on the floor
you with your gun and me with a belt
and the ammo feeding you
feed me you said
and i was feeding you jack
you know mandrake
i happen to believe in a life
after this one
and i know ill have to answer
for what ive done
and i think i can
yes well of course you can jack
of course you can you can
im a religious man myself
you know jack
i believe in all that sort of thing
and im hoping you know jack
youve dropped your gun jack
yes you know what
no jack let me take that for you
ill take that for you jack
you know what im hoping im hoping
youre going to give me the code
and youre going to have a wash
and brush up what a good idea
always did wonders for a man
a wash and brush up
water on the back of the neck
makes you feel marvelous
thats what we need
water on the neck and the code
now supposing i play a little
guessing game with you jack boy
ill try and guess
what the code is
copilot to navigator
im ready with the fuel figures now
we have 109000 total
79000 in the mains
and 30000 in the auxiliaries
and that works out
to roughly
seven hours 15 minutes
endurance from this time

wheres general ripper
hes dead in the bathroom
wheres the bathroom
next to you
i dont know what stupid game
youre playing
but ive got an idea
what the recall code is
i have to get in touch
with sac headquarters
i said put your hands over your head
and keep them there go on
got any witnesses
witnesses
what are you talking about
he shot himself
while he was shaving huh
now look colonel bat guano
if that really is your name
may i tell you that i have
a very very good idea
i think i hope i pray
what the recall code is
its some theme he kept repeating
a variation on peace on earth
or purity of essence one of those
put your hands up on top of
your head start walking
dont you know that general ripper
went mad
and sent the whole wing
to attack the soviets
what are you talking about
ill tell you what im talking about
im gonna pick up this red telephone
which is connected to sac
and i hope
blast blast
shot away i expect by one of your
men during this ridiculous fighting
right
all right charlie ive been
wasting too much time on you
i got a lot of wounded men outside
start walking
all the radio gear is out
including the crm 114
i think the autodestruct mechanism
got hit and blew itself up
the fire is out
the emergency power is on
everything seems to
check out all right will advise
roger navigator
ive worked out our rate of fuel loss
at approximately 162 per minute
this gives us a radius of action
sufficient to take out
primary and secondary targets
but we will not
repeat not be able to make it back
to any base or neutral country
however we would have enough fuel
to ditch at weather ship tango delta
however we would have enough fuel
to ditch at weather ship tango delta
grid coordinates 003 691
well boys
we got three engines out
we got more holes in us
than a horse traders mule
the radio is gone
and were leaking fuel
if we was flying any lower
wed need sleigh bells on this thing
but we got one little budge
on them russkies
at this height
they might harpoon us
but they sure aint gonna spot us
on no radar screen
the other way
where are you taking me
to the main gate
colonel
colonel i must know what you think
has been going on here
you wanna know what i think
yes
i think youre some kind
of deviated prevert
i think ripper found out
about your preversion
and that you were organizing some
kind of mutiny of preverts now move
i dont know anything
about any planes attacking russia
i was told get ripper on the phone
with the president of the united states
now just one second
you just said the president
what about the president
the president wants to speak
to general ripper doesnt he
now general ripper is dead
is he not
i am general rippers
executive officer
so the president will want
to speak to me wont he
theres a telephone box over there
and the line may be open
you wanna talk to
the president of the united states
i dont want to talk to him
ive got to talk to him
and if you dont put that gun away
and stop this stupid nonsense
the court of inquiry on this
will give you such a pranging
youll be lucky to end up wearing the
uniform of a bloody toilet attendant
okay go ahead
try and get the president
of the united states on the phone
if you try any preversions in there
ill blow your head off
operator this is
group captain lionel mandrake

mr president
im not a sentimentalist
by nature
but i think i know
whats in every heart in this room
i think we ought to all
just bow our heads
and give a short prayer of thanks
for our deliverance lord
we have heard the wings
of the angel of death
fluttering over our heads
from the valley of fear
you have seen fit to deliver us
from the forces of evil
excuse me sir
premier kissoffs calling again
and hes hopping mad
fuel flow on active engines
and leakage has increased
now works out at 205
estimate remaining fuel
at 8790
roger confirm 205 per minute
and remaining fuel 8790
no no dimitri
there must be some mistake
no im certain of that
im perfectly certain
of that dimitri
just a second
you know what he says
he says one of the planes
hasnt turned back
according to information
forwarded by our air staffs
its headed for
the missile complex at laputa
thats impossible mr president
i mean look at the big board
thirtyfour planes 30 recalls
acknowledged and four splashes
and one of them
was targeted for laputa
dimitri look weve got an
acknowledgment from every plane
except the four
youve shot down
he hang on a second dimitri
he says their air defense now only
claims three aircraft confirmed
the fourth may only be damaged
mr president im beginning to smell
a big fat commie rat
i mean supposing kissoff
is lying about that fourth plane
just looking for an excuse
to clobber us
if the spaghetti hits the fan now
were in trouble
dimitri look
if this report is true
and the plane manages
to bomb the target
is this gonna set off
the doomsday machine
are you sure
well i guess youre just gonna have
to get that plane dimitri
im sorry theyre jamming
your radar and flying so low
but theyre trained to do it
you know its initiative
look dimitri you know
exactly where theyre going
and im sure your entire air defense
can stop a single plane
listen its not gonna help
either one of us
if the doomsday machine
goes off now is it
dimitri theres no point in you getting
hysterical at a moment like this
dimitri keep your feet on the ground
while youre talking dimitri
i am not i am not getting
no dimitri im just worried
thats all
look if our air staff say
its primary target is laputa
and its secondary target is
borchov i mean its true dimitri
youve gotta believe it
look can i dimitri can i give
you just one word
can i give you just one word
of advice dimitri
listen dimitri
put everything youve got into those
two sectors and you cant miss
sir if we continue to lose fuel
at the present rate
i estimate we only have
38 minutes flying time
which will not even take us
as far as the primary
doggone it sweets you told me
that you could get me to the primary
im sorry sir that estimate was based
on the original loss rate factor
not at 205
i dont give a hoot in hell
how you do it
just get me to the primary
you hear
just get me to the primary
you hear
im sorry sir
but those are the figures
well be lucky to reach
weather ship at tango delta
well shoot
we aint come this far just
to dump this thing in the drink
whats the nearest target
of opportunity
sir if the rate of loss
does not increase
we have a chance
to reach target 384
grid coordinate 003 691
and possibly make it from there
to the tango delta weather ship
what kind of a target
is that anyhow
sir thats the icbm
complex at kotloss
all right
designating new target 384
give me a heading on that as soon
as you get it worked out
well well keep our fingers crossed
remember were all in this together
were right behind you
were with you all the way
yes well well keep the line open
all right dimitri
general turgidson is there really
a chance for that plane to get through
mr president
if i may speak freely
the russki talks big but frankly
we think hes short of knowhow
you cant expect ignorant peons to
understand a machine like our boys
and thats not meant as an insult
we all know how much guts
the average russkis got
look at all of them the nazis
killed off they still wouldnt quit
cant you stick to the point
well sir if the pilots good
see
i mean if hes really sharp
he can barrel that baby in so low
you ought to see it its a sight
a big plane like a 52
its jet exhaust frying chickens
in the barnyard
yeah but has he got a chance
has he got a chance

where in hell is major kong
what about major kong
mr president i would not
rule out the chance
mr president i would not
rule out the chance
to preserve a nucleus
of human specimens
it would be quite easy
at the bottom of some
of our deeper mineshafts
the radioactivity would not penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep
and in a matter of weeks sufficient
improvements in dwelling space
could easily be provided
how long would you have
to stay down there
well lets see now
cobalt thorium g
radioactive halflife of
i would think that
possibly 100 years
you mean people could actually
stay down there for 100 years
it would not be difficult
mein führer
nuclear reactors could
im sorry mr president
nuclear reactors could provide
power almost indefinitely
greenhouses could maintain
plant life
animals could be bred
and slaughtered
a quick survey would have
to be made
of the available mine sites
in the country
but i would guess
that a dwelling space
for several hundred thousand of
our people could easily be provided
well i would hate
to have to decide
who stays up
and who goes down
well that would not be necessary
mr president
it could easily be accomplished
with a computer
the computer could
be set and programmed
to accept factors
from youth health
sexual fertility intelligence
and a crosssection
of necessary skills
of course it would be
absolutely vital
that our top government
and military men be included
that our top government
and military men be included
to foster and impart the required
principles of leadership and tradition
naturally they would breed
prodigiously
there would be much time
and little to do
but with the proper breeding
techniques and a ratio of say
10 females to each male
they could then work their way back
to the present gross national product
within say 20 years
but look here doctor
wouldnt this nucleus of survivors
be so griefstricken
and anguished that theyd
well envy the dead
and not wanna go on living
no sir excuse me
no sir when they go down into the
mine everyone would still be alive
there would be
no shocking memories
the prevailing emotion will be one
of nostalgia for those left behind
combined with a spirit of bold
curiosity for the adventure ahead
doctor
you mentioned the ratio
of 10 women to each man
now wouldnt that necessitate
the abandonment
of the socalled
monogamous sexual relationship
i mean as far as men
were concerned
i mean as far as men
were concerned
regrettably yes
but it is you know a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race
i hasten to add that since each man
will be required to do prodigious
service along these lines
the women will have to be selected
for their sexual characteristics
which will have to be of
a highly stimulating nature
i must confess you have an
astonishingly good idea there doctor
thank you sir
i think we ought to look at this from
the military point of view i mean
supposing the russkies stashed away
some big bombs see and we didnt
when they come out in 100 years
they could take over
i agree mr president
they might try a sneak attack so they
could take over our mineshaft space
itd be extremely naive of us to imagine
that these new developments
are gonna cause any change
in soviet expansionist policy
i mean we must be
increasingly on the alert
to prevent them from taking over
mineshaft space
in order to breed more
than we do
thus knocking us out through
