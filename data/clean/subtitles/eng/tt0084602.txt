i waited at your house for an hour 
your wife said you might be here 
  what are you doin  here 
  business 
if the papers knew we were talkin  like
this  they d think we was crazy  why you 
cos i m the best and you need
somebody to teach you different 
  why 
  you can t pull it off without me 
you still didn t give me the answer 
what s the real reason 
listen  it s quiet  isn t it 
when you retire  it s too quiet 
we too young to retire  anyway 
besides  i could promote this thing into
the biggest gate ever  bigger than ours 
heaven knows  i don t mind being
involved with large numbers  right 
i don t need this no more 
i    i don t want this no more 
look  man  when you beat me   
   i hurt all over  i didn t wanna know
from nobody  not even my kids 
every fighter knows that hurt 
we get sick inside trying to live
with it  so don t back off now 
make it right for yourself
or you ll be sorry you didn t 
we held the greatest title
in the whole world  babe 
you lost that fight for all
the wrong reasons  you lost your edge 
all right  i know your manager dying
had you all messed up inside 
but the truth is you didn t look hungry 
now when we fought   
   you had that eye of the tiger  man 
the edge 
now you gotta get it back  and the way
to do it is to go back to the beginning 
maybe we could win it back together 
eye of the tiger  man 
why d you have to come here 
i have the plan  get back  man 
you got me curious 
you got me curious  rock 
clubber  do you accept the challenge

what s the matter with you 
can i talk to you 
i wanna ask you something important 
and i want you to tell me the truth 
  what 
  why d you come here 
i just don t want it no more 
  if it s over cos you want it to be  i m glad 
  i do 
it s just    you ve never quit
anything since i ve known you 
i don t know what you want me to say 
i mean  what happened 
how did everything
that was so good get so bad 
what s so bad  tell me  what 
i wrecked everything
by not thinking for myself 
why couldn t mickey tell me
where it was really at from the start 
he didn t have to carry me and lie and
make me think i was better than i was 
  he never lied 
  those fights weren t right 
i never fought anybody in their prime 
there was always some angle to keep
the title longer than i shoulda had it 
do you understand 
you ve gotta understand  he loved you 
that was his job  protecting you 
protectin  don t help nothin  
it makes things worse 
you wake up one day thinking you re
a winner  but you re not  you re a loser 
so we wouldn t have had
the title as long  so what 
  at least it would have been real 
  it was real 
nothing is real
if you don t believe in who you are 
i don t believe in myself no more 
when a fighter don t believe 
he s finished  that s it 
that s not it 
why don t you tell me the truth 
what are you puttin  me through 
you wanna know the truth 
i don t wanna lose what i got 
at first  i didn t care about what happened 
i d go in the ring  get bust up 
but now there s you and the kid 
i don t wanna lose what i got 
what do we have that can t be replaced 
what  a house  we got cars  money 
we got everything but the truth 
what s the truth  dammit  
i m afraid  all right 
you wanna hear me say it 
you wanna break me down  i m afraid 
for the first time  i m afraid 
i m afraid too 
there s nothin  wrong with that 
  there is  for me  there is 
  why  you re human 
i don t know what i am  i know i m a liar 
and because of that  mickey ain t here 
you didn t push him into anything  he was
a grown man  he did what he had to do 
and you have no right to feel guilty 
you don t 
you were a champion 
you did what you were expected to do 
you did what everybody
thought you should do 
and you wanna tell me that those fights
weren t real  i don t believe it 
it doesn t matter what i believe 
you ve got to carry that fear inside you   
   afraid everybody ll take things away 
that you ll be remembered as a coward   
   that you re not a man any more 
well  none of it s true 
it doesn t matter if i tell you because
you re the one that s got to settle it 
get rid of it  cos when the smoke clears 
and they stop chanting your name   
   it s just gonna be us 
and you can t live like this 
we can t live like this 
cos it s gonna bother you for the rest of
your life  look what it s doing to you now 
apollo thinks you can do it  so do i 
but you gotta wanna do it for the right
reasons  not for the guilt over mickey 
not for the people  not for the title 
not for money  or me   but for you 
just you  just you alone 
  and if i lose 
  then you lose 
but at least you lose
with no excuses  no fear 
and i know you could live with that 
how d you get so tough 
i live with a fighter 
i really love you 
i love you 
   rocky theme 
no  no  no  rock  no 
just flick it  just flick it 
faster  faster

good evening 
i m stu nahan  with bill baldwin 
we welcome you
to madison square garden 
it s the anxiously awaited rematch   
   between former champion rocky balboa
and the reigning champion clubber lang 
we now switch to our remote
cameras inside the dressing rooms 
would you comment on how you plan
to fight balboa  what s your strategy 
don t need any 
balboa s so predictable and stupid 
the man comes straight ahead  he s
tailor made for me  he s gonna get hurt 
  that s good 
  turn  em over  good 
how does that look  ok 
no  i don t hate balboa  but i pity the fool 
and i will destroy
any man who tries to take what i got 
remember where you came from 
remember what it took to get you here 
and remember what
he did to you last time  right 
both are brawlers  with the edge
and power going to clubber lang   
   so i would say the odds are very long
against balboa regaining his title 
now it s your turn  it s your turn  huh 
what s your prediction for the fight 
  prediction 
  yes  prediction 
pain 
lang likes to hurt a man to the body 
and balboa may never have
psychologically recovered   
   from that vicious knockout
that clubber laid on him 
it s time 
  here 
  what 
i want you to wear these 
come on  apollo  these are the colours
that you wore in our first fight together
