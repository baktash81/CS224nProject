lets give them
some room
come on ben
its all right
lets give them
some room
thanks for that
i go in blind like this
i could make things worse
i trust you
hey
ive been here for days
i want to know about my son
no
dont
karen
sorry for this tom
i hope youre not afraid
whatever you think
theyve done to me
im still karen
this way
you said what they were doing
to ben was a process
whatever it is
can it be stopped
thats up to you
me
tom
its time to face facts
theyve won
theres no use prolonging
hostilities for either side
meaning what theyre asking
for a ceasefire
no theyre allowing
the resistance
to surrender
allowing the resistance
to surrender
sounds like weve been more
trouble than they expected
dont overestimate
a few small victories
the resistance
is an inconvenience
they are offering you
a gift tom
a chance to have a life
a real life
with hal and matt
and ben
after everything
theyve done
you expect me
to take that on faith
no
not on faith
once you hear
what they have to offer
im sure youll understand
everything
so they finally
got the bullet out
but anne says hes looking
pretty weak
your fathers a fighter hal
i know that firsthand
yeah but you saw
the way he looked
theres no telling what else
hes been through
hows ben handling it
hes been keeping
to himself
you know hes got to feel
like hell
you notice anything else
about him
look bens fine
all right
if the skitters are still
pulling his strings
i think theyd make him miss
every now and then
i still want you
to keep an eye on him
now i know
that youre worried
about your father hal
but we got a situation here
yeah like how this
eightminute escape window
just turned into two
those munitions we lucked into
allowed us to inflict
some serious pain
but these ambushes were
supposed to be a holding action
till we got new orders
youre not thinking about
backing down are you
we havent heard word one
from any of the other units
since that attack
on boston
for all i know were the only
ones still left in the fight
and im for killing these
bastards every chance we get
but we get boxed in
we may not come out
so we dont get boxed in
all right
were finally drawing blood
that was the point
right
got to hurt them
as much as they hurt us
im gonna go get some air
if anything changes
just come outside
the girl told us you were
a historian before we came
karen
its not her anymore is it
im talking to you
she is allowing me
to speak through her
allowing
she has no choice
you took her like you took
ben and everything else
there was
no other way
weve studied you
in great detail professor
weve drawn from that
to make a proposal
that would end hostilities
between us
in exchange
for sanctuary
we will set aside
a protected area
where human survivors
will be relocated
some kind
of prison camp
a place where you would be
allowed to live in peace
you must be familiar
with the concept
its taken directly
from your own history
the worst of it
you cant handpick
from our darkest moments
like cambodia
or nazi germany
or nanking my lai
the trail of tears
please
professor mason
we can think of dozens
of more examples
be honest
oppression is in your nature
and that is your justification
for the murder of billions
if those atrocities
are the worst of us
what does that make you
the ones who will decide
if your world lives or dies
ben ive been looking
for you
i wanted to be by myself
for a while
you heard
what happened right
yeah i know you didnt mean
to hurt dad
youre going out again
got no choice
pope and anthony sent another
alien patrol our direction
we dont ambush them
on our terms
they could roll
right over us
its not fair
ii should be going
with you
okay
youre nowhere near ready
because everyone keeps
treating me like a little kid
im old enough to fight
old enough to know how
at least
how about this
when i get back
ill see what i can do
thanks
sure youre up for this
skitters are coming
whether we like it or not
hey thanks buddy
oh sorry
go ahead you first
wow you sure know how
to impress a girl
whats next
his and her grenade launchers
who knows i might do something
crazy like open a door for you
hey ben
hey wait up
hey i know what happened
with dad was an accident
but the next time
i give an order
i need to know
youre gonna listen
whatever you say
hey hold up hey
whats up man
i dont get you
i mean as much as he got
into it with weaver
dad always understood
chain of command
ill follow your orders
but youre not dad okay
pretty sweet spot
for wasting skitters
put a shooter up on the roof
with a barrett
yeah a 50cal will put a hole
through anything
maybe get
a cross fire going
with that dry cleaner
right there
while you kids
get that started
me and the brain trust well
get the cooties attention
well come back
to the north side
get out of the truck
take cover
get out of the truck
do it now
get down
not the harley
pope stop stop
come on man
let it go bro
let it go
come on
what the hell
went wrong
damned if i know
never even got off a shot
theyre onto us
theres something else
the way they kept laying fire
into the truck
after we bugged out
its like that was the target
we know
they can pick up heat
could be the engine
is what got their attention
first time
theyve targeted vehicles
first time for everything
with these beamers
on constant patrol
were screwed and blued
and you can kiss
this ambush plan goodbye
if we cant run our trucks
were not mobile
the skitters got to know
were close
wont be long before
they catch our scent
captain
you wanted to see me
dai tells me
that youre doing a fair job
of taking over for scott
he did
i can only hope
hes right
we think that the aliens have
recalibrated their beamers
to pick up the heat
coming off our vehicles
probably using
some infrared sensor
as long as we stay put
engines off they cant see us
only thats not
an option
our patrols
just saw three alien units
all walking around out there
all within five miles
its only a matter of time
before they nail us
if we cant move our vehicles
we lose our mobility
and we lose most
of our supplies
we need to find
a way to mask the heat
coming off those engines
long enough to put some distance
between us and those patrols
well how far
at least 20 miles
20 miles
that would mean keeping the engines
cooled out for at least an hour
okay
all right ill try
you dont get points
for effort
we dont find a way
to move those vehicles
people are going to die
no pressure
i dont care
what you wanted from us
there must have been a way
to get it peacefully
you didnt even try to talk
to us before the attack
this was never
a negotiation
thats why well never stop
fighting you
we have no patience
for empty bravado
so those
are our alternatives
live as prisoners or die
why would you expect
better from us
than you do
from yourselves
because i look
around this ship
at the technology that
brought you from another world
and i want to believe
that only an advanced species
could have
achieved so much
but i would be wrong
you will lead your people
to the neutral zone
no
then the choice
has been made
i would be careful about drawing
too many lessons from the past
why is that
because our history
has yet to be written
tom mason 2nd mass
i didnt know
they had anybody else
neither did i
bonnie garcia
vermont militia
bastards wanted me
to lead them to my guys
talk them into buying
this sanctuary bull
thats why they took us
to finish what they started
this isnt right
oh my god
everybody run
dont give it a target
run
find your stance
lean forward a bit
hey ben
whats matt doing
with a gun
bens teaching me
how to shoot
figured it was time
he needs to learn
how to defend himself
so you just gave him a rifle
without asking me
i might have to follow
your orders on missions
but not here
hal wait
go back to camp matt
go back to camp
you know maybe hes ready
maybe hes not
but we both know
dad didnt want that for him
three months ago how do you
know what hed say now
i dont know
what hed say right now
and neither do you
okay
so how about we wait
and let dad make that decision
only way we win this war
is by killing
every skitter we see
if matts old enough
to load a gun
hes old enough
to shoot it
after what happened
with dad
you think youre the best one
to be giving lessons
i just dont want him
to be taken away
the way they took me
or your girlfriend
karen
im not the math geek
you used to push around
deal with it
its like i dont
even know him anymore
hal
michigan
stop
quit struggling
stop get off of me
i swear if you dont let go of that bag
i will shoot you
leave me alone its all we have left
please
i will shoot you
no
do you understand
every store within 20 miles
has been picked clean
please please
run
if i see you again
ill use this
my names tom
im not gonna hurt you
i just wanted
to see your bike
no its mine
hey hey
stop it
im not letting you
steal it
come on come on
im sorry
i should have asked
look i know
that youre scared
but im not
gonna hurt you
if he comes back
we dont want to be here
we had a few cans of soup
thats all
go ahead
take it and leave me alone
you hang on to it
im on my way
into boston
i left some people there
friends and family
they can help us
bikes yours but i sure
would love to borrow it
you can come with me
boston
thats hundreds of miles
oh i know it
ive been on foot
for weeks already
sowhat do you say
just remember
its a loan
and only
as long as i say
and only if we dont
leave her like that
fair enough
captain
ill have the med bus packed
and ready to go in a halfhour
hows tom
i need to know what happened
to him on that ship
ben and lourdes are with him
hes weak
but if we have to move
i think its all right
dr glass
do you know anything
about scotch
somes good
somes better
why
i found this
couple of stops back
its a glenfiddich
30 years old
someone
has good tastes
if we have to run
its just dead weight
seemed like itd be a shame
to waste it
cheers
cheers
maybe its a sign
tom coming back
how do you mean
i mean that if i hadnt let him
get on that ship
if hed been here
he would have warned me
that we were
pushing our luck
he would have warned me
but he wasnt here
secondguessing doesnt change
where we are
i think youre wrong
i remember something
he told me once
about making the price
of the occupation so high
the aliens have to leave
that was the idea
he would have said your strategy
is risky but worth it
and when he wakes up
hes gonna be proud
were still fighting
hell he might even have
a historical anecdote
to put it all
in perspective
captain
what the hell is this
fiberglass
its light
its an insulator
and these warehouses
are full of it
we wrap our engines
with it
well get a good hour
before it heats through
i want people going
through every house
every warehouse
on the block
were moving out asap
dr glass
anne
ben
anne
its my dad
somethings wrong

i must have missed
a fragment
he feels feverish
too
we still have a few bottles
of iv antibiotic
okay

ive been seeing
a lot of airships
heading southwest
to connecticut
could be
they went that way
the woman we buried
that was my mom
im sorry
you never told me why you
helped me out with that guy
thats what people
are supposed to do
not anymore
i dont believe that
and id hope that someone
would do the same for my kids
we were going
into the mountains
trying to find
a place to hide
i dont think that we can hide
from them anymore
my middle son ben
youd like him
hes about your age
hes dead
no

thats what happens now
the aliens find you
and they kill you
unless
we kill them first

this truck for a hat
thats another thing
when the hell did i become
a damn baggage handler
i was gonna say
it kind of suits you
yeah well ill tell you
if i had any brains
id steal one
of these rice rockets
and kiss weavers glorious
revolution goodbye
yeah you try that
and your brains
will be scattered
across two states pope
you really are a true believer
arent you
in killing skitters
yeah
yeah well thats pretty
but uh you know
theres no law that says
you got to do it with me
my merry exband of outlaws
wasted your buddy
and yet here you are
tonto to my lone ranger
well first i think you got
that lone ranger thing
a bit backward
and dont think
that i forgot about click

after we went in
on that alien structure
i cant make sense
of either
we all make mistakes
