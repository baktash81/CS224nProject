lourdes

she s right  come on 
let s give them some room 
let s give them
some room 
come on  ben 
it s all right 
let s give them

thanks for that 
i go in blind like this 
i could make things worse 
i trust you 
hey 
i ve been here for days 
i want to know about my son 
no 
don t 
karen 
sorry for this  tom 
i hope you re not afraid 
whatever you think
they ve done to me 
i m still karen 
this way 
you said what they were doing
to ben was a process 
whatever it is 
can it be stopped 
  that s up to you 
  me 
tom 
it s time to face facts 
they ve won 
there s no use prolonging
hostilities for either side 
meaning what  they re asking
for a cease fire 
no  they re allowing
the resistance
to surrender 
 allowing the resistance
to surrender  
sounds like we ve been more
trouble than they expected 
don t overestimate
a few small victories 
the resistance
is an inconvenience 
they are offering you
a gift  tom   
a chance to have a life 
a real life 
with hal and matt
and ben 
after everything
they ve done 
you expect me
to take that on faith 
no 
not on faith 
once you hear
what they have to offer 
i m sure you ll understand   
everything 
so  they finally
got the bullet out 
but anne says he s looking
pretty weak 
your father s a fighter  hal 
i know that firsthand 
yeah  but you saw
the way he looked 
there s no telling what else
he s been through 
how s ben handling it 
he s been keeping
to himself 
you know  he s got to feel
like hell 
you notice anything else
about him 
look  ben s fine 
all right 
if the skitters are still
pulling his strings 
i think they d make him miss
every now and then 
i still want you
to keep an eye on him 
now  i know
that you re worried
about your father  hal 
but we got a situation here 
yeah  like how this
eight minute escape window
just turned into two 
those munitions we lucked into
allowed us to inflict
some serious pain 
but these ambushes were
supposed to be a holding action
till we got new orders 
you re not thinking about
backing down  are you 
we haven t heard word one
from any of the other units
since that attack
on boston 
for all i know  we re the only
ones still left in the fight 
and i m for killing these
bastards every chance we get 
but we get boxed in 
we may not come out 
so we don t get boxed in 
all right 
we re finally drawing blood 
that was the point 
right 
got to hurt them
as much as they hurt us 
i m gonna go get some air 
if anything changes 
just come outside 
the girl told us you were
a historian before we came 
karen 
it s not her anymore  is it 
i m talking to you 
she is allowing me
to speak through her 
 allowing  
she has no choice 
you took her like you took   
ben and everything else 
there was
no other way 
we ve studied you
in great detail  professor 
we ve drawn from that
to make a proposal
that would end hostilities
between us 
in exchange
for sanctuary 
we will set aside
a protected area
where human survivors
will be relocated 
some kind
of prison camp 
a place where you would be
allowed to live in peace 
you must be familiar
with the concept 
it s taken directly
from your own history 
the worst of it 
you can t hand pick
from our darkest moments
like cambodia
or nazi germany 
or nanking  my lai 
the trail of tears 
please 
professor mason 
we can think of dozens
of more examples 
be honest 
oppression is in your nature 
and that is your justification
for the murder of billions 
if those atrocities
are the worst of us   
what does that make you 
the ones who will decide
if your world lives or dies 
ben  i ve been looking
for you 
i wanted to be by myself
for a while 
you heard
what happened  right 
yeah  i know you didn t mean
to hurt dad 
you re going out again 
got no choice 
pope and anthony sent another
alien patrol our direction 
we don t ambush them
on our terms 
they could roll
right over us 
it s not fair 
i i should be going
with you 
okay 
you re nowhere near ready 
because everyone keeps
treating me like a little kid 
i m old enough to fight 
old enough to know how 
at least 
how about this 
when i get back 
i ll see what i can do 
thanks 
sure you re up for this 
skitters are coming 
whether we like it or not 
hey  thanks  buddy 
oh  sorry 
go ahead  you first 
wow  you sure know how
to impress a girl 
what s next   
his and her grenade launchers 
who knows  i might do something
crazy like open a door for you 
hey  ben 
hey  wait up 
hey  i know what happened
with dad was an accident 
but the next time
i give an order 
i need to know
you re gonna listen 
whatever you say 
hey  hold up  hey 
what s up  man 
i don t get you 
i mean  as much as he got
into it with weaver 
dad always understood
chain of command 
i ll follow your orders 
but you re not dad  okay 
pretty sweet spot
for wasting skitters 
put a shooter up on the roof
with a barrett 
yeah  a  50 cal will put a hole
through anything 
maybe get
a cross fire going
with that dry cleaner
right there 
while you kids
get that started 
me and the brain trust  we ll
get the cooties  attention 
we ll come back
to the north side 
get out of the truck 
take cover 
get out of the truck 
do it now 
get down 
not the harley 
pope  stop  stop 
come on  man 
let it go  bro 
let it go 
come on 
what the hell
went wrong 
damned if i know 
never even got off a shot 
they re onto us 
there s something else 
the way they kept laying fire
into the truck
after we bugged out   
it s like that was the target 
we know
they can pick up heat 
could be the engine
is what got their attention 
first time
they ve targeted vehicles 
first time for everything 
with these beamers
on constant patrol   
we re screwed and blued 
and you can kiss
this ambush plan goodbye 
if we can t run our trucks 
we re not mobile 
the skitters got to know
we re close 
won t be long before
they catch our scent 
captain 
you wanted to see me 
dai tells me
that you re doing a fair job
of taking over for scott 
he did 
i can only hope
he s right 
we think that the aliens have
recalibrated their beamers
to pick up the heat
coming off our vehicles 
probably using
some infrared sensor 
as long as we stay put 
engines off  they can t see us 
only that s not
an option 
our patrols
just saw three alien units
all walking around out there 
all within five miles 
it s only a matter of time
before they nail us 
if we can t move our vehicles 
we lose our mobility 
and we lose most
of our supplies 
we need to find
a way to mask the heat
coming off those engines
long enough to put some distance
between us and those patrols 
well  how far 
at least 20 miles 
20 miles 
that would mean keeping the engines
cooled out for at least an hour 
okay 
all right  i ll try 
you don t get points
for effort 
we don t find a way
to move those vehicles 
people are going to die 
no pressure 
i don t care
what you wanted from us 
there must have been a way
to get it peacefully 
you didn t even try to talk
to us before the attack 
this was never
a negotiation 
that s why we ll never stop
fighting you 
we have no patience
for empty bravado 
so those
are our alternatives   
live as prisoners or die 
why would you expect
better from us
than you do
from yourselves 
because i look
around this ship 
at the technology that
brought you from another world 
and i want to believe
that only an advanced species
could have
achieved so much 
but i would be wrong 
you will lead your people
to the neutral zone 
no 
then the choice
has been made 
i would be careful about drawing
too many lessons from the past 
why is that 
because our history
has yet to be written 
tom mason  2nd mass 
i didn t know
they had anybody else 
neither did i 
bonnie garcia 
vermont militia 
bastards wanted me
to lead them to my guys 
talk them into buying
this sanctuary bull 
that s why they took us   
to finish what they started 
this isn t right 
oh  my god 
everybody run 
don t give it a target 
run 
find your stance 
lean forward a bit 
hey  ben 
what s matt doing
with a gun 
ben s teaching me
how to shoot 
figured it was time 
he needs to learn
how to defend himself 
so you just gave him a rifle
without asking me 
i might have to follow
your orders on missions 
but not here 
hal  wait 
go back to camp  matt 
go back to camp 
you know  maybe he s ready 
maybe he s not 
but we both know
dad didn t want that for him 
three months ago  how do you
know what he d say now 
i don t know
what he d say right now 
and neither do you 
okay 
so how about we wait
and let dad make that decision 
only way we win this war
is by killing
every skitter we see 
if matt s old enough
to load a gun 
he s old enough
to shoot it 
after what happened
with dad 
you think you re the best one
to be giving lessons 
i just don t want him
to be taken away
the way they took me 
or your girlfriend 
karen 
i m not the math geek
you used to push around 
deal with it 
it s like i don t
even know him anymore 
hal 
michigan 
  stop 
  quit struggling 
stop  get off of me 
i swear  if you don t let go of that bag 
i will shoot you 
leave me alone  it s all we have left 
please 
i will shoot you 
no 
do you understand  
every store within 20 miles
has been picked clean 
please  please 
run 
if i see you again 
i ll use this 
my name s tom 
i m not gonna hurt you 
i just wanted
to see your bike 
no  it s mine 
hey  hey 
stop it 
i m not letting you
steal it 
come on  come on 
i m sorry 
i should have asked 
look  i know
that you re scared 
but i m not
gonna hurt you 
if he comes back 
we don t want to be here 
we had a few cans of soup 
that s all 
go ahead 
take it and leave me alone 
you hang on to it 
i m on my way
into boston 
i left some people there   
friends and family 
they can help us 
bike s yours  but i sure
would love to borrow it 
you can come with me 
boston 
that s hundreds of miles 
oh  i know it 
i ve been on foot
for weeks already 
so   what do you say 
just remember
it s a loan 
and only
as long as i say 
and only if we don t
leave her like that 
fair enough 
captain 
i ll have the med bus packed
and ready to go in a half hour 
how s tom 
i need to know what happened
to him on that ship 
ben and lourdes are with him 
he s weak 
but if we have to move 
i think it s all right 
dr  glass 
do you know anything
about scotch 
some s good 
some s better 
why 
i found this   
couple of stops back 
it s a glenfiddich 
30 years old 
someone
has good tastes 
if we have to run 
it s just dead weight 
seemed like it d be a shame
to waste it 
cheers 
cheers 
maybe it s a sign   
tom coming back 
how do you mean 
i mean that if i hadn t let him
get on that ship   
   if he d been here 
he would have warned me
that we were
pushing our luck 
he would have warned me 
but he wasn t here 
second guessing doesn t change
where we are 
i think you re wrong 
i remember something
he told me once 
about making the price
of the occupation so high 
the aliens have to leave 
that was the idea 
he would have said your strategy
is risky but worth it 
and when he wakes up 
he s gonna be proud
we re still fighting 
hell  he might even have
a historical anecdote
to put it all
in perspective 
captain 
what the hell is this 
fiberglass 
it s light 
it s an insulator 
and these warehouses
are full of it 
we wrap our engines
with it 
we ll get a good hour
before it heats through 
i want people going
through every house 
every warehouse
on the block 
we re moving out a s a p 
dr  glass  
anne  
ben 
anne 
it s my dad 
something s wrong 
let s go 
we re close now 
we got to keep going 
i don t know what happened 
he just started bleeding again 
i must have missed
a fragment 
he feels feverish 
too 
we still have a few bottles
of i v  antibiotic 
okay 
okay 
i m sorry  ben 
the school s only a few miles
that way 
but they d be long gone
by now 
i ve been seeing
a lot of airships
heading southwest
to connecticut 
could be
they went that way 
the woman we buried 
that was my mom 
i m sorry 
you never told me why you
helped me out with that guy 
that s what people
are supposed to do 
not anymore 
i don t believe that 
and i d hope that someone
would do the same for my kids 
we were going
into the mountains 
trying to find
a place to hide 
i don t think that we can hide
from them anymore 
my middle son  ben   
you d like him 
he s about your age 
he s dead 
no 
they re all dead 
that s what happens now 
the aliens find you 
and they kill you 
unless
we kill them first 
come on 
we got to keep going 
this engine blanket thing
better work 
or we ll be wearing
this truck for a hat 
that s another thing 
when the hell did i become
a damn baggage handler 
i was gonna say
it kind of suits you 
yeah  well  i ll tell you 
if i had any brains 
i d steal one
of these rice rockets
and kiss weaver s glorious
revolution goodbye 
yeah  you try that 
and your brains
will be scattered
across two states  pope 
you really are a true believer 
aren t you 
in killing skitters 
yeah 
yeah  well  that s pretty 
but  uh  you know 
there s no law that says
you got to do it with me 
my merry ex band of outlaws
wasted your buddy 
and yet here you are 
tonto to my lone ranger 
well  first  i think you got
that  lone ranger  thing
a bit backward 
and don t think
that i forgot about click   
or when you patched me up
after we went in
on that alien structure 
i can t make sense
of either 
we all make mistakes 
captain
