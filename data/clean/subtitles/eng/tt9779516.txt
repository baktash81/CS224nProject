jean luc

never look at you again 
melissa

what if this is destiny 
what if we were
supposed to meet

there s a reason 
if one person s life
is changed

i ve never seen a faith
like yours  babe 
it s a beacon for me 
it s a beacon for everyone
who knows you 
it reminds me of a story 
there was a woman who
was sick for a long time 
a really long time 
but she had this   
this total faith
that if she could
just touch jesus 
just touch his clothes 
that she would be healed 
and that s exactly
what she did 
she broke through the crowd 
and with everything
that she had 
she reached for him 
just like i see you do at
every single concert  melissa 
reaching out in faith 
touching heaven 
can we do something special
for the most special person
in my life tonight 
 all cheer and applaud 
can we pray for her 
because i believe
that god still heals 
  you guys agree

the chemotherapy 
we re seeing growth
in your scan 
i m seeing them
on your ovaries 
and i m sorry 
but you re going to need
a hysterectomy 
i know that this is
a serious decision 
but i recommend that
it be done very soon 
how soon 
in the next week 
two at the most 
our doctors are extremely
skilled  and the risks are low 
wait 
are you telling me that i m not
gonna be able to have children 
i m afraid so 
jeremy  hey  it s okay 
no  no  it s not 
i love kids 
you re so good
with kids 
dr  furst  melissa 
it s my professional opinion
that this is
absolutely necessary 
given your condition
and what we re seeing
on the tests 
well  then run more tests 
please  just run more tests 
we ve run them all 
and they re very conclusive 
mmm 
 clears throat

she s with jesus 
jannette   crying  no 
i didn t get to say goodbye 
i m tom camp 
i m looking for my son 
jeremy 
mr  camp 
he s still in the room 
 somber music playing 
get some sleep 
see you in the morning 
mom and i will have breakfast
ready for you when you get up 
jeremy  dad 
can i ask you a question 
anything 
i remember i prayed
and prayed in this room
for josh to be
born healthy 
it didn t happen 
and you prayed for so long
for your ministry 
still nothing 
dad  i begged god
to heal melissa 
what am i supposed
to do with that 
are you asking
if josh s disabilities
were disappointing 
yes  they are 
did i have big dreams
that didn t come true 
sure 
do i understand why melissa
isn t here anymore 
no  son  i don t 
i m sorry 
but i know
my life is full 
i feel rich 
and i m proud
of this family 
honestly  at the time 
i didn t agree
with what you did 
i didn t understand it 
you chose willingly to walk
into the fire with her 
right beside her 
all the way to the end 
but then 
that s exactly what i would do
for your mom and you boys 
that s what love is 
and i got to watch
my son do that 
for his wife 
that was a privilege 
i don t know the answers
to your questions 
but i do know this 
that my life is not full
in spite of
the disappointments 
it s full because of them 
i m proud of you 
i love you  dad 
 exhales deeply 
 thunder rumbling 
melissa  jeremy 
i m healed 
  i think i m healed  it s god 
   ekg beeping 
you know the stars
that shine the brightest 
the ones
with the shortest life 
you re going to be healed 
heather  i need a doctor 
jeremy  i promise you 
melissa 
it doesn t hurt anymore 
i can t feel it 
you were right 
you have to believe   
 thunder rumbling 
why did you do this 
melissa  jeremy 
i know
you ll find this someday 
see  i m finally letting you
read my journal 
and i ve thought a lot about
the day i realized i loved you 
remember 
i just watched you there 
awestruck by your gift 
knowing god would use it
someday to touch the world 
i felt that day
the same way i do now 
you re asleep on my shoulder
right now 
i guess one of the benefits
of the pain is that
it s hard to sleep 
which means i have
a lot of time to think 
and i ve thought a lot
about the stories
you love to tell
at your concerts 
you re so good at it 
ancient stories 
still relevant and true 
in one story 
god grants healing 
miracles do happen 
yet to another  his call
is to suffer  and even die 
and i realized something 
they both have value 
because each is a chapter
in a bigger story 
each is the stroke of a brush
on his beautiful canvas 
each is the light of one star
helping to form a galaxy 
and i think i m one of
those lucky people
meant to experience both 
i had my miracle 
it led to the perfect day
with you 
it was enough 
i ve learned that suffering
doesn t destroy faith 
it refines it 
and god is worth trusting 
even when we can t see 
i m safe in his arms
going bravely into the light
with a peace
that i can t understand 
so  do one thing
for me  jeremy camp 
for my sake 
for the sake of your gift
and everyone meant to hear it 
when you re ready 
pick up your guitar 
 inaudible 
 crowd cheering 
jean luc  and now 
we have an artist
with his first gold record
with five number one
hit singles 
he has a story to tell 
let s welcome
my friend jeremy camp 
 crowd cheering
and applauding 
what s going on  guys 
my name is jeremy camp 
uh   
a few years ago 
i met a girl named melissa 
and she is  and always will
be  the love of my life 
melissa died
with this incomprehensible 
selfless faith 
she was always
reaching for heaven 
and i believe
she finally touched it 
i believe
she finally touched it 
and she had to tell me that
there would be another day 
with no more pain 
with no more tears 
with no more sorrow 
another day where i would
get to see her again 
i know i m not the only one
hurting here today 
she told me that
if just one person s life
was changed by her story 
then it would ve
all been worth it 
just one 
so  this one s for her 
 crowd cheering 
  i still believe
in your faithfulness
  i still believe in your truth
  i still believe
in your holy word
  even when i don t see
i still believe
 crowd cheering 
  though the questions
fog up my mind
  with promises
i still seem to bear
  even when answers
slowly unwind
  it s my heart
i see you prepare
  but it s now that i feel
  your grace fall like rain
  from every fingertip
  washing away my pain
  yeah
  i still believe
in your holy word
  even when i don t see
i still believe
  i still believe
  i still believe
  oh
  i still believe in you
  i still believe
 cheering and applause 
 indistinct chatter 
jeremy 
uh  you don t 
uh  know me 
i feel like i knew her 
your wife 
melissa 
i was there the night
that you prayed over her 
we were the next band 
i d just gotten in
from south africa
and i was  uh 
going through a really hard time 
and i honestly
was trapped
in this web of  like 
apathy and disappointment 
i had lost someone
close to me 
i was angry
and hurt and   
i thought the world
was full of hypocrites
and i was the worst of them 
 chuckles 
i guess
i just wanted to know
that god was real 
somewhere in the universe 
like  to a person 
an actual person in an
actual  meaningful way 
and i looked at her 
your wife  that night 
 sniffles 
she was  like  glowing
with something
i ve never had 
her story
and your story  it   
it rescued me 
i m the one
whose life was changed 
and there will be
millions more 
i just wanted you
to know that 
thank you 
it means a lot 
hey 
what s your name  again 
adrienne 
jeremy  you were right 
i ve never seen stars
like this before 
i love you  melissa 
and i m gonna tell your story 
 inaudible 
adrienne 
i feel very protective
of jeremy and melissa s story 
 voice breaking 
i think  because of how much
the lord did in my life 
that it was something
that i needed to hear 
jeremy  god was telling me to
pick my guitar up  and i m like 
 the last i wanna do
is pick my guitar up  
i remember feeling the presence
of god so thick in that room 
like  just  like 
i needed that 
right what came out was just 
 okay  i still believe  
literally  like 
 i still believe in you  
that s what i wanted to say
