last gleaming   
  whose broad stripes
and bright stars  
  through the
perilous fýght  
  o er the ramparts
we watched  
  were so gallantly
streaming  
  and the rocket s
red glare  
  the bombs bursting
in air  
  gave proof
through the night  
  that our flag
was still there  
  oh  say  does that  
  star spangled banner  
  yet wave  
  o er the land
of the free  
  and the home
of the brave   
gentlemen

i want to point out three flags
you ll have to obey 
first  the green flag

the green flag means

the yellow flag means

or someone has a problem
that will slow down the track 
please follow
your leader 
the third flag is
the checkered flag 
this needs
no explanation 
this is a 200 lap 
50 mile bicycle race 
it will consist of 33
4 man teams 
for the fýrst year 
an out of town team has
been invited to participate

the green flag is up 
the little 500
is underway 
and here they come 
rounding the corner
for the completion of
the fýrst of 200 laps today 
so after 25 laps  
two of the perennial
favorites
are up front   
the sigma tau omega team
and the acacia team  
i should point out
what a remarkable job
the cutter team is doing  
they started in
34th position
and are moving up
through the field  
oh   
the acacia team just signaled
for an exchange  
the single rider is
accelerating away  
getting a lead
so the receiver
will not be behind
when the pack comes by  
beautiful exchange  
the other team is exchanging
right behind them  
sigma tau omega team  
another team is moving in
on the outside  
it s team 34 
the cutter team  
he is fighting hard
to take the lead  
he has taken the lead  
team 34 has succeeded
in taking the lead
from the last position  
what an incredible effort
by the leader of this race  
come on 
you got him 
the delta chis
and the acacia team  
the rider for
the cutters team   
dave stohler   
that s my boy 
is pulling
ahead even further    
pulling ahead 
it s incredible
what he s    
come on  dave 
he s turning in
some terrific
lap times here  
i don t happen to have
a stopwatch  but   
he won t last 
it s utterly amazing  
after 25 miles   
that s 100 laps  folks   
the rider for the cutters
is still out front 
he has yet to
come in for an exchange  
we re
number one 
someone s down  
there s an accident  
i can t see who  
just a second  
it s dave stohler
from the cutter team  
he had a 3 4 lap lead  
i can t see
if he s hurt  
he s getting back
on the bike  
but he s obviously
in agony  
come on  dave 
no way 
he wants off  man 
that s the signal 
he s coming in 
here you go 
i don t want
to race 
get on the bike 
it s ours now 
it s our race 
we got it 
get going 
no one is going 
the other riders
are holding the bike 
get out there 
mike 
get on the bike 
the little
guy s riding 
  you o k  
  what s the matter 
what
happened 
as a result of that
terrible exchange  
the cutter team has
dropped from the lead  
the sigma tau omega team
has regained the lead  
the cutter team has fallen
into second position  
another team has passed
the cutter team  
the cutters
are in third place
and seem to be
losing ground  
well  ev  he tried 
even the announcer
said he tried 
it s all over 
help 
nice try  kid 
the lead team has just
completed 170 laps  
there are 30 laps
remaining  
sigma tau omega
looks unbeatable  
many things can happen  
as we ve already seen  
things can change
like the wind  
stay on
this side 
bring it in 
go  you cutter  go 
the cutters now have
a new man on the bike  
he s doing a good job  
he has moved the cutters
into fourth position  
he might make a serious
challenge for third position  
we ll wait to see
if this happens  
we re not
doing too bad 
this once again points out
the fact that this
is a team effort  
one man may fall back  
another may be exceptional    
we showed them 
showed them what 
come on  mike 
bring it in 
come on 
stohler is on the bike  
his teammates are taping
his feet to the pedals  
this means he won t be able
to exchange riders  
he must ride
15 laps by himself  
pick it up 
pick it up 
pick it up 
he s back in
the race 
he has dropped from fourth
into sixth position  
there are only
15 laps remaining  
go  son 
go  damn you 
stay behind him
till the third turn 
the cutters  
team number 34 
now in second place  
they have completed
198 laps  
198 laps  
still leading  sigma tau omega  
team number 1 
and here comes your leader
through turn number four  
coming down
to take the white flag  
one lap to go  
it s a duel between
sigma tau omega and cutters  
teams number 1 and 34 
as they battle out
through the last lap  
teams number 1 and 34
battling neck and neck
as they come down
the short stretch  
half a lap to go  
they re going into
turn number three  
number 1 
still leading  
34 coming up very close
on the inside  
they re going
for the checkered flag  
and 34 wins  
and 34 wins  
and now  this is what
you have been waiting for 
the winning team 
from bloomington 
indiana 
the winner of
the little 500
