  sitting outside
in the sunshine  
  but soon  
  we ll be apart  
  and soon  
  it ll be night in bloom  
  now things are fine  
  the clouds are far away
up in the sky  
  but soon  
  i ll be on a plane  
  and soon  
  you ll feel the cold rain  
  you promised
to stay in touch  
  when we re apart  
  you promised
before i left  
  that you ll always love me  
  time goes by  and people cry  
  and everything
goes too fast  
woman 
do you consider the book
to be autobiographical 
mm hmm  um  well  i mean   
isn t everything
autobiographical 
i mean  we all see the world
through our own   
tiny keyhole  right 
i mean  i always think
of thomas wolfe 
you know  have you
ever seen that  
that little one page
 note to reader 
in the front of
look homeward  angel 
right  you know
what m talking about 
anyway  h he says that
we are the sum
of all the moments of our lives 
and that anybody
who sits down to write
is gonna use the clay
of their own life 
that you can t avoid that 
so when i look at my own life 
you know 
i have to admit  right 
that i ve  
i ve never been around
a bunch of guns  or violence 
you know  not really 
no   political intrigue 
or helicopter crash  right 
but my life 
from my own point of view 
has been full of drama  right 
and  uh  so i thought
if i could write a book that   
that could capture
what it s like
to really meet somebody 
i mean  one of the most
exciting things
that s ever
happened to me  right 
is to really meet somebody 
make that connection 
and if i could   
make that valuable 
you know  to capture that 
that would be
the attempt  or   
did i answer your question 
i   
i ll try to be more specific 
okay 
okay 
were there ever
a french young woman on a train 
you met
and spent an evening with 
ahhh   
um   
see  to me  that   
i mean  uh   
that s not important 
you know 
woman 
so that s a yes 
all right 
since i m in france 
and this is the last stop
of my book tour 
yes 
 crowd laughing 
thank you 
mr  wallace  um 
the book ends
on an ambiguous note 
we don t know 
d do you think they get
back together
in six months
like they promise each other 
jesse 
like they promised  um   
i think i answered that 
you know  it s a  
it s a good test  right 
if you re a romantic
or a cynic 
right  i mean 
you think   you think
they get back together  right 
you don t  for sure 
no 
and you hope they do 
but  you know  you re not sure 
that s why you re
asking the question 
and   and do you think
they get back together 
i mean  did you
in real life 
 sighs 
did i in real   
 man laughs 
look  in the words
of my grandfather  okay 
 to answer that   
would take the piss
out of the whole thing  
oh  no 
 speaks french 
we just have
the time
for one last question  hmm 
what   
what is your next book 
uh   
i don t know  man 
i don t know 
i ve been   
i ve been thinking about this  
well  i always
kind of wanted to write a book
that all took place
within the space of a pop song 
you know 
like three or four minutes long 
the whole thing 
the story  the idea 
is that there s this guy 
all right  and   
he s totally depressed 
i mean  his great dream
was to be a lover 
an adventurer 
you know  riding motorcycles
through south america 
and instead  he s sitting at
a marble table  eating lobster 
and he s got a good job
and a beautiful wife  right 
but   you know 
everything that he needs   
but that d   doesn t matter 
because what he wants   
is to fight for meaning 
you know 
i mean  happiness
is in the doing  right 
not in the getting
what you want 
so he s sitting there 
and just that second 
his little 5 year old daughter
hops up on the table 
and he knows
that she should get down 
because she could get hurt 
but she s dancing
to this pop song
in a summer dress 
and he looks down 
and all of a sudden 
he s 16   
and his high school sweetheart
is dropping him off at home 
and they just lost
their virginity 
and she loves him 
and the same song
is playing on the car radio 
and she climbs up
and starts dancing
on the roof of the car 
and now   now
he s worried about her 
and she s beautiful  with a   
a facial expression  you know 
just like his daughter s 
in fact  you know  maybe
that s why he even likes her 
you know  i mean  see   
he knows he s not
remembering this dance 
he s there 
he s there in  
in both moments 
simultaneously 
and just  like  for an instant 
all his life is just
folding in on itself 
and it s obvious
to him that time is a lie 
uh   
that it s all happening
all the time 
and inside every moment
is another moment  all   
you know 
happening simultaneously 
and  anyway  that s  
that s kind of the idea 
anyway 
well  our author
has to be going
to the airport soon

congratulations 
thank you  thank you 
wait

before we go anywhere

i have to ask you

did you show up in vienna
that december

but did you 
i need to know 
it s important to me

well  did you 
no 
oh 
oh  thank god 
you didn t 
well  thank god  you didn t 
oh  my god 
i mean  thank god 
i didn t  and you didn t 
if only one of us
had showed up there  alone 
i know 
then that would ve sucked 
i know  i was
so concerned with that 
i always felt horrible
about not being there 
but i couldn t 
you know  my grandma
died a few days before 
and she was buried
that day  december 16th 
that day 
she died  the one in budapest 
yes  you remember that 
yeah  i remember
everything 
of course 
it was in your book 
i know  so   
but anyway  i was about
to fly to vienna 
you know  and i  
and we heard
the news about her 
and  of course  i had
to go to the funeral
with my parents 
yeah  well 
i m sorry
to hear that 
i know   
but you weren t
there  anyway 
wait 
why weren t you there 
i would ve been there
if i could ve 
i made plans and   
wait 
you better have
a good reason 
what 
oh  no 
no  you were there 
weren t you 
oh  no 
 laughing 
oh  that s terrible 
i know i m laughing 
but i don t mean it 
did you hate me 
you must ve hated me 
have you been hating me
all this time  you have 
no 
yes  you have 
no  no 
oh  but you can t hate me now  right 
i don t  
my grandma  
i don t hate you 
all right  come on 
it s no big deal 
all right 
i flew all the way
over there 
you blew the thing off 
and my life s been
a big nosedive since then 
but i mean 
it s not a problem 
you can t say that 
i m kidding 
oh  i can t
believe it 
you must have been
so angry with me 
i m so sorry 
i really wanted
to be there
more than anything
in the world 
i swear 
honestly  i swear  
you can t be angry now  
my grandmother 
no  i know  i know 
i honestly thought
that something like that
might ve happened 
i was definitely bummed 
 sighs 
but   mostly 
i was just mad
we hadn t exchanged
any phone numbers
or any information 
i know 
i know 
that was so stupid 
no way to get in touch 
we had nothing to go on 
i didn t know
your last name  nothing 
i know  i know  remember 
we were both afraid
that if we started
writing and calling 
that it would slowly   
you know  fade out 
yeah  it definitely
wasn t a slow fade 
no  it sure wasn t 
 laughs 
i know  we wanted to
pick it up where we left off 
which would ve been fine
if it had worked 
yes  a good idea  yep 
oh  well 
 sighs 
so   
so   
how long were you
in vienna  then 
eh  just a couple days 
did you meet
another girl 
uh  yeah 
her name was gretchen 
and she was amazing 
you did 
yeah  the book s really
a composite of the two of you 
really  oh  no 
no  i m kidding 
you wouldn t believe it 
i even went back
to the train station 
i put up signs  you know 
of my number at the hotel
oh   
in case you d been delayed 
i was a total dork 
let s go this way 
did you get any calls 
just a couple hookers
looking for a gig  you know 
no 
it was awful 
i mean  what do you
want me to say  like   
oh  that s so sad 
i m so sorry 
i walked around
for a couple days 
eventually  i flew home 
i owed my dad 2000 bucks 
who had warned me about
french chicks  i have to say 
what did he tell you
about french women 
nothing  the guy  
he s never met any french women 
okay 
he s never been east
of the mississippi 
so why didn t you put
that six months later
the french bitch
didn t show up 
no  but i did  i did 
you did  no 
yeah  no  
i mean  i made it
more hopeful 
i   i wrote this
whole fictional version
where you actually
do show up 
oh  what happens 
well  um   
what 
uh  we  
we make love
for about 10 days straight 
that s one part of it 
oh  that s interesting 
so the french slut  right 
yeah  exactly 
yeah  okay  great  okay 
it s just then 
you know  they  
they start to get to
know each other better 
and they realize that
they don t get along at all 
oh  i like that 
it s more real 
yeah  well  my editor
didn t think that way 
no  everyone wants
to believe in love 
it sells  right 
yeah  exactly  so   
so things are going well
for you  right 
i mean  your book
is a best seller in the u s 
yeah   er  it s
a tiny best seller 
oh  come on 
no  uh  
all right  yeah  right 
officially  yes 
but most people haven t read
moby dick  you know 
so why should
they read my book 
i haven t read moby dick 
and i liked your book  so   
oh  thanks 
i mean  
even though   
 chuckles 
i thought you idealized
the night of it 
oh  come on 
it s officially
fiction  right 
no  no 
i mean  i m supposed to   
i know  i know 
i thought  you know 
there were times
where you made me  
 gasps 
what 
well  i mean 
 her   right 
no   me  
okay  whatever 
uh  a little bit neurotic 
all right  but you are a little
bit like that  aren t you 
you think i m neurotic 
no  no  no 
no  come on 
i m kidding 
where did i do that 
i didn t do that 
well  maybe it s just me 
you know  um   
reading something 
knowing that the character
in the story is based on you 
it s both   flattering
and disturbing at the same time 
yeah  h how is
it disturbing 
i don t know 
um  just being part of
someone else s memory 
seeing myself
through your eyes 
how long did it
take you to write it 
um    uh   
three or four years 
on and off 
wow  that s
a really long time
to be writing
about one night 
yeah  i know 
tell me about it 
 groans 
i always assumed
you had forgotten me 
 chuckles 
no  i had a pretty clear picture
of you in my mind 
i have to tell you
something 
i just  
what 
i ve wanted to
talk to you for so long 
but now  
yeah  me too 
it s just surreal 
i know  i know 
i feel like everything
out of my mouth should be  
how long do we have 
twenty minutes and 30 seconds 
let s go 
no  we got more than that 
i want to know about you 
tell me  what are you doing 
you know 
what are you up to 
uh    where to start 
i  uh   
i work for green cross 
it s an environmental
organization 
yeah  what are
they all about 
well  we basically work
on different
environment issues 
from clean water
right 
to disarmament
of chemical weapons 
you know 
international laws
that deal
with the environment 
and wh what do you
do for them 
we re going this way 
oh 
uh    different things 
like  last year i was in india
for quite a while 
working on
a water treatment plant 
wow 
yeah  well 
the cotton industry there
is a major source
of pollution  so   
i mean  itust sounds
like you re actually
doing something 
you know 
i mean  most people 
myself included 
just sit around
and bitch 
america s consuming
all the world s resources 
yep 
suvs suck 
global warming is real 
you know  i m really
relieved to hear
you re not one of those
 freedom fries 
kind of americans 
yeah  well   
hey  you know   
but how d you
get into that 
ah  i came out
of political science 
and i was hoping to work
for the government 
and i did
for a little while 
ugh  terrible 
not good 
yeah  no  anyway 
i got really tired  
let s go this way 
  of having this endless
conversation with friends
about how the world
was falling to pieces 
so i decided
what i really wanted to do
was to find things
that could be fixed
and try to fix them 
you know 
yeah  you know  i just  
well   
i ve always thought you d be
doing something cool like that 
i did  i   
thanks 
i just  
i just feel really   
really lucky to be doing
a job i like  you know 
yeah 
you know 
i actually alternated
between thinking that 
you know 
everything is
irrevocably screwed up 
and that things might be
getting better in some ways 
better  how could you
possibly say that 
well  i just mean 
you know  like   
i mean  i know
it sounds weird 
but there are things
to be optimistic about 
okay 
um  i know your book is selling 
which is great 
i m very happy for you 
i  
but let me break
the news to you  okay 
the world is a mess right now 
i m not  
i wasn t  
from a western point of view 
things are getting
a bit better  okay 
we re moving all our industry
to developing nations
i know  
where we can get cheap labor
free of any
environmental laws  okay 
the weapon industry
is booming 
five million people
die every year
from preventable water diseases 
right  i know  i  
so how is the world
getting any better 
i m not getting angry 
but come on  i want to know 
i m interested 
okay  okay 
i realize   
 sighs 
that there are a lot of
serious problems in the world 
okay  thank you 
okay 
i mean  i don t
even have one publisher
in the whole asian market 
okay  all right 
 laughs 
say  stop  
what  what 
stop 
ohhh 
no  look  all i m saying
is there s more awareness
out there  right 
people are gonna fight back 
okay 
you know  i mean  
i mean  i think the world
might be getting better
because people like you
are educated and speaking out 
even the very notion
of conservation
and environmental issues 
yeah 
those weren t even
in the vocabulary
until fairly recently 
you know 
and they re becoming
the norm 
and eventually 
might be what s expected
all over the world 
you d think 
i agree with
what you re saying 
but at the same time 
it s dangerous 
an imperialist country
can use that kind
of thinking
to justify
their economic greed 
yeah 
you know  hu   human rights  
is there any particular
imperialist country
you have in mind
there  frenchie 
hmm  no  not really 
no 
mm mmm 
bonsoir 
bonsoir 
 sighs 
so you want
to sit over there 
yeah  all this is perfect 
oh  wow 
maybe what i m saying is 
is the world might be
evolving the way
a person evolves  right 
mm hmmm 
like  i mean  me  for example 
am i getting worse 
am i improving 
i don t know 
when i was younger   
i was healthier 
but i was  uh  wracked
with insecurity  you know 
now i m older 
and my problems are deeper 
but i m more equipped
to handle them 
so  what are
your problems 
right now   
i don t have any 
i don t  you know 
i m just   
 inhales 
damn happy to be here 
me too 
so how long have you
been in paris 
i got in last night  i ve done
10 cities in 12 days  and i m   
i m wrecked  i m so glad
it s over  you know 
i m tired of being
a huckster 
hello 
 speaks french 
what do you want 
um    a cup of coffee 
 speaks french 
 sighs 
god  i love this café 
i wish they had places
like this in the u s 
yeah  i missed cafés
when i was living over there 
i mean  i find a few places
i really liked 
but there was  
wait  you  
you were living in the u s  
yes  from  uh 
 96 to  99 
i was studying at nyu 
oh  god 
don t tell me that  celine 
what 
no  no  it s just   
nothing  i mean  i  
what 
i ve been living in new york
since  98  you know 
we were there at the same time 
in new york 
yeah 
wow  that s weird 
it actually crossed my mind
a few times
that i might run into you 
but the odds are so
slim  right  so   
i didn t even know
what city you were living in 
weren t you
somewhere in texas 
point  texas 
yeah  yeah  yeah  definitely 
i just  
i was for a long time 
i just   you know 
wanted to try new york 
hmmm  wow 
what brought you
back here 
uh    i had finished
my master s  for one 
and no visa 
no more visa 
and anyway  i was
starting to get paranoid 
all the violence
in the medias 
gang violence  murders 
oh  yeah  right 
especially
serial killers 
 laughs 
but the final straw was
one night i heard some noise
on my fire escape 
so i called 911 
and the cops came
eventually 
yeah  three hours later 
yeah  after i d been   
raped and killed
about three times 
 laughs 
no  but   it was a man
and a woman officer 
and i was explaining to them
what i had heard
when the woman
had to run downstairs
to move the police car 
so i was left alone
with the male cop 
and right away he asked me
if i had a gun 
and i said 
 no  of course not  i    
and he told me 
 well  you d better think
about getting one 
this is america 
not france  
okay  and i said to him 
you know 
 i have no idea
how to shoot a gun 
and i have no interest
in firearms whatsoever  
and that s when he pulled out
his gun like this 
and he went 
 well  one day   
 you re gonna have something
like this in your face 
 and if you wanna have
a long life   
you re gonna have to choose
between you or them  
and then they left 
and the next morning 
i called for an application
to get a gun 
 laughs 
me  with a gun 
i mean 
that s really scary 
but then i realized
something was wrong 
the way that cop
had pulled his gun out 
and everything  right 
yeah  sure 
so i cancelled
my demand for the gun 
and i called
the police station
and tried to complain
about that cop s behavior  but  
what happened with that 
it was so much paperwork 
 laughs 
and then i got
scared with my shitty
student visa 
yeah  he thought
you d get deported 
yeah  exactly 
yeah 
so i gave up  and i forgot about
the whole thing 
well  i guess
i never forgot 
well  obviously 
i ll get through 
yeah 
 chuckles 
but still  you know 
 sighs 
i really enjoyed
being there 
there s a lot of things
i miss about the u s 
yeah  like what 
um   
well   
the overall good mood
people have there 
like  you know  even if
it can be bullshit sometimes 
like   how you doing  
 great  how you doing  
 great  
 laughs 
 have a great day  
i don t know 
parisians can be so grumpy 
have you noticed 
mmm    no  everybody seems
no 
pretty happy to me 
mmm  they re not happy 
they re not happy 
nnnn   no 
 both laugh 
no  they are 
i don t know  really 
i just mean french men 
they drive me nuts 
what is it 
what about them 
well  they re very nice 
they  
they re great  you know 
to be around 
they love food  wine 
they re great cooks 
but i don t know 
maybe i ve   i ve had
really bad luck with them 
well  why 
what do you mean 
um  well 
i guess
they re not as   
what 
what s the word 
um   
horny 
 laughs 
they re not as horny 
horny 
all right  now  wait

i am proud to be an american 
and you should be 
in that regard only 
merci 
have you ever spent some time
in eastern europe 
eastern    no  i don t

i went to warsaw
when it was still
a strict communist regime  
which i don t
approve of at all 
oh  yeah  sure you do 
no  i don t 
no  i was just kidding 
but anyway 
something about being there
was very interesting 
i found 
after a couple of weeks 
something changed in me 
the city was
quite gloomy and gray  and   
but after a while 
my brain seemed clearer 
i was writing a lot more
in my journal 
ideas i d never
thought of before  
communist ideas 
listen  i am not
a communist  no 
sorry  i can t  
well  okay 
go on 
okay 
 both laugh 
i ll send you to a gulag 
okay 
no  well  it took me a while
to figure out
why i felt  you know 
so different 
and then one day 
as i was walking through
the jewish cemetery 
i don t know why 
but it occurred to me there 
i realized that i had spent
the last two weeks
away from most of my habits 
tv was in a language
i didn t understand 
there was nothing to buy 
no advertisements anywhere 
so all i d been doing
was   
walk around  think
and write 
my brain felt like
it was at rest 
free from
the  consuming  frenzy 
and i have to say  it was
almost like a natural high 
i felt so peaceful
inside 
no strange urge
to be somewhere else 
to shop   
mm hmm 
maybe it could have seemed
like boredom at first 
but it quickly became
very  very soulful 
hmm 
it was interesting 
you know 
can you believe
it was nine years ago
that we were
walking around vienna 
nine years 
no  that s impossible 
nine  i was 
i know  it feels
like two months ago to me 
but it was summer  94 
mm hmm 
do i look any different 
i do 
i d have to see you naked 
what  
i know  i m sorry 
 both laugh 
no  your hair was
different back then 
it was like   
well  it s the same  
yeah  take it down 
let s see 
down  it was down  okay 
yeah 
well  voilà 
so 
well   
okay  come on  tell me 
uh   
skinnier  i think 
little thinner 
did you think
i was fat before 
no 
 laughs 
yeah  you thought
i was a fatty 
no  you thought
i was a fatty 
yeah  you wrote a book
about a fat french girl 
no  listen 
oh  no   
seriously  all right 
you look beautiful 
do i look any different 
no 
mmm 
not at all 
oh  actually 
you have this line 
i know 
it s like a scar 
a scar 
what  like a gunshot wound 
 laughs 
no  no  no  i like it 
i m sorry 
i had this   funny  
well   horrible dream
the other day  um   
i was having
this awful nightmare
that i was 32 
really 
and then i woke up 
and i was 23 
so relieved 
right 
and then i woke up for real 
and i was 32 
shit  i know 
scary 
it happens 
yeah  time goes
faster and faster 
apparently 
it s because we don t
renew our synapses after 20 
so it s pretty much
downhill from then on  oh  well 
yeah 
 laughs 
i like getting older 
you know 
life feels   
i don t know 
it feels more immediate 
mm hmm 
you know  like 
i can appreciate things more 
no  me too  actually 
i   i really love it 
i was once a   
a drummer in a band 
you were 
yeah 
we were pretty good  actually 
wow 
mm hmm 
but the lead singer guy 
he was just so obsessed with us
getting a record deal  you know 
yeah 
it s all we talked about 
it s all we thought about 
getting bigger shows 
everything was just focused
on the future all the time 
and now the   
band doesn t even
exist anymore  right 
and looking back at the   
at the shows we did play 
even rehearsing  you know 
it was so much fun 
now i d be able to enjoy
every minute of it 
could i have a drag of that 
mm hmm 
well  your book
has been published 
that s   that s
a pretty big deal 
and you ve been
all around europe with it 
are you enjoying
every minute of it 
not really 
not really 
no 
 both laugh 
you have
another one of those 
yes  of course 
um   
here 
in my field  i see
these people that  
oh  sorry 
  come into it
with big idealist visions
of becoming the new leader
that will create a better world 
they enjoy the goal 
but not the process 
right 
but the reality of it is
that the true work
of improving things
is in the little achievements
of the day 
and that s what you need
to enjoy  to stay in that field 
what do you mean here  exactly 
well  for example 
i was working
for this organization
that helped
villages in mexico 
and their concerns
was how to get the pencils
sent to the kid
in those little country schools 
it was not about big 
revolutionary ideas 
hmm 
it was about pencils 
i see the people
that do the real work 
and what s really sad 
in a way  is that
the people that are
the most giving  hard working 
and capable
of making this world better
usually don t have the ego
and ambition to be a leader 
they don t see any interest
in superficial rewards 
they don t care
if their name ever appear
in the press 
they actually enjoy
the process of helping others 
they re in the moment 
yeah  but that s so hard 
you know  to be in the moment 
yeah 
i mean  i just feel
like i m   
designed to be   
slightly dissatisfied
with everything  you know 
i mean  like  always trying to
better my situation  you know 
i satisfy one desire 
and it just agitates another 
you know  but then i think
ah  to hell with it  right 
i mean 
desire s the fuel of life 
yes 
i mean  do you think
it s true that if   
if we never wanted anything 
we d never be unhappy 
i don t know 
not wanting anything is  
isn t that
a sympm of depression 
 laughs 
yeah  that is  right 
yes  i   
i mean  it s healthy
to desire  right 
yeah  i don t know 
i mean  it s what all
those buddhist guys say  right 
you know 
liberate yourself from desire 
and you ll find that you already
have everything you need 
yeah  but i feel really alive
when i want something more
than just basic survival needs 
i mean  wanting  whether it s
intimacy with another person 
or a new pair of shoes 
is kind of beautiful 
i like that we have
those ever renewing desires 
you know 
yeah  well 
maybe it s just
a sense of entitlement 
you know  like 
whenever you feel
like you deserve
that new pair of shoes 
you know  i mean 
it s okay to want things
as long as
you don t get pissed off
if you don t get them  right 
yeah 
life s hard 
it s supposed to be 
if we didn t suffer 
we wouldn t learn a thing 
you know 
so  what are you 
buddhist or something 
no 
no  why not 
i don t know  uh   
same reason i don t
really consider myself
anything  really 
yeah  i know 
i decided a long time ago
that i was gonna
be open to everything 
but not buy into
any one and only belief system 
i went to
this trappist monastery
a couple years ago 
trappist 
yeah  they re
catholic  cistercian 
oh 
yeah 
why did you do that 
why  i d just been doing
some reading  i guess 
i don t know 
i thought it d be cool 
have you ever spent any time
with any monks or nuns 
no 
it s not really my style 
no 
no 
 both laugh 
but go ahead 
well  i  
i expected them to be
all glowering and stern 
you know  but they weren t 
they were really quick to laugh 
really easy to be around 
seriously  very attuned
to everything 
 chuckles 
they were just  uh   
you know  they weren t
trying to hustle anybody 
mm hmm 
they re trying to live
and die in peace with god 
you know  or whatever part
of them they feel is eternal 
you know  and it was just
so refreshing to be around 
you know  you realize that most
of the people that you meet
are trying
to get somewhere better 
you know  they re trying
to make a little bit more cash 
they re trying to get
a little more respect 
have more people admire them 
you know 
it s just exhausting 
no kidding 
you know  and it s exhausting
to be one of those
people yourself  you know 
 laughs 
i mean  there i am  right 
you know  all greedy
to be more spiritual  you know 
i wanna be a better person 
you know 
you can t escape 
i had this  uh   
this boyfriend of mine 
many years ago 
that wanted to be
a buddhist 
so he went to asia to visit
some of those monasteries 
yeah  i thought
about doing that too 
yeah  and you should 
really 
i ll tell you why 
uh  he was
quite good looking 
and each time he went
to one of those monasteries 
a monk offered
to suck his cock 
 both laugh 
true story 
well  it all comes down to that 
doesn t it 
mmm 
and i think that s why i
really admire what you re doing 
you know 
what do you mean 
sucking cock 
uh  no 
no 
 both laugh 
wrong answer 
no  yeah  
no  i was gonna say 
uh   
you know  you re not detached
from life  you know 
you ve put in your  
passion into action 
well  i try 
hey  you know something 
what 
i m gonna be on planes
and  like  in an airport
for the next eight hours 
uh huh 
i d just love to see
a little bit more of paris 
would you walk around
with me a little 
yeah  let s do that 
do you mind 
no  let s  yeah  that s great 
do you want to 
what do we owe here  4 50 
uh  
no  i got it  i got it 
okay 
i got a little per diem
going on here 
this good for  like 
a tip and everything 
yeah  that s fine 
yeah 
that s more than enough 
i ll throw that in there too 
all right  is there
anywhere to go around here 
uh  it s sales day today 
what s that 
it s when everything
is on sale in paris 
it s twice a year 
au revoir  merci 
 man speaks french 
au revoir  merci 
oh  let s
go shopping 
no  no  no  no 
that s a bad idea 
i don t want
to inflict that on you 
no 
it s madness 
let s just go
on this garden path 
all right 
it s really nice 
jesse 
all right  all right 
that sounds better
than shopping  actually 
i mean  not that i wouldn t
do whatever you wanted 
you know  sometimes  i don t
even need to buy anything 
i just get high on trying on
and looking at things 
you know  a therapist
would tell you  
is this where we re going 
yeah 
a therapist would tell you
that s all good 
really 
yeah 
are you ever in therapy 
no 
jesse 
do i seem like i m in therapy 
celine 
i m kidding 
has it helped
your sex problems 
my sex problems 
no  i m kidding 
oh  come on 
tell me the truth 
we didn t have
any problems that night 
no  i m kidding 
we didn t even
have sex anyway 
wait  that s a joke  right 
no  we didn t 
well  what   
that was the whole thing 
no  of course we did 
no  no  no  no 
we didn t 
you didn t
have a condom 
and i never have sex
without one 
especially
on a one night thing 
i m extremely paranoid
about my health 
there s no way  
whoa  whoa 
i m finding this scary
that you don t remember 
why    no  listen 
okay  i didn t write
an entire book 
 chuckles 
but i kept a journal  okay 
and i wrote
the whole night in it 
that s what i meant 
you idealizing the night 
all right  listen 
i even remember what brand
of condom we used 
okay  that s disgusting 
i don t want to hear it 
that s not disgusting 
no 
well   
okay  you know what 
when i get home 
i ll check my journal from  94 
but i know i m right 
all right 
wait a minute 
what 
was it in the cemetery 
 scoffs 
no 
no  we went to the cemetery
in the afternoon 
it was in the park 
very late at night 
in the park 
park   
wait a minute  wait a minute 
this is   
i can t   
 chuckles 
no  i  
is it that forgettable 
i mean 
you really don t remember 
in the park 
okay  wait a minute 
i   i think
you might be right 
all right  no  you re
messing with me now 
no   
are you messing with me 
okay  no  i m sorry 
i think you re  
i mean 
you re right  okay 
sometime i put things
in drawers inside my head
and forget about it 
i guess it s less painful
to put certain things away
than to live with it 
i m sorry  it s  
so that night was
like a sad memory for you 
no  i didn t mean
that night in particular 
i just meant certain things
are better off forgotten 
i remember that night
better than i do entire years 
me too 
really 
well  i thought i did   
uh huh 
 both chuckle 
but maybe i   
maybe i put it away
because of the fact
that my grandmother s
funeral was the day
we were supposed to
meet again 
yeah  right  it was
a tough day for me 
but it must ve been
worse for you 
it was unreal 
i remember looking at
her dead body in the coffin   
 sighs 
   at her beautiful hands 
so warm  so sweet 
that used to
hold me but   
nothing in that coffin resembled
what i remembered of her 
all the warmth was gone 
and then i was crying 
so confused 
if i was crying
because i was
never gonna see her again 
or never gonna see   
you again  or   
i m sorry 
no  it s all right 
i m sorry to go
on like this 
i ve been a little down
this week  i don t know 
why 
i don t know  nothing bad 
just  um   
reading your book 
maybe 
no  but thinking
of how hopeful i was
that summer and fall 
and since then
it s been kind of  um   
 sighs 
i don t know 
memory is
a wonderful thing
if you don t have to   
deal with the past 
 both laugh 
what 
 memory is
a wonderful thing
if you don t have to
deal with the past  
can put that
on a bumper sticker 
you know  if you wrote
a book about our night 
that d be a good title 
yeah  and it would be
a total different book 
yeah  there d be no sex scenes 
 laughs  yeah 
but you know what 
what 
now that we ve met again 
we can change our memory
of that december 16th 
it no longer has
that sad ending
of us never seeing
each other again  right 
yeah  you re right 
i mean  i guess
a memory s never finished
as long as you re alive 
yeah  i know 
 chuckles 
i have this memory
from my childhood
that i realized
recently never happened 
what 
well   
when i was
eight nor nine 
my mom was so paranoid
when i was walking home
from my piano lesson at night 
mm hmm 
she would always warn me
about dirty old men
giving me candies
and then showing me
their pee pees 
 laughs 
she was
so obsessed with it
that later in life 
you know 
i   i had this image in my head
that this really happened 
to the point that
i even associated sex
with that walk home 
i mean  and sometimes
even now when i m   
 laughs 
when i m hav   
when i m having sex 
i see myself walking
down that street 
 laughs 
i swear 
it s so weird  right 
well 
is that street nearby 
i mean  could   
could we  no 
very far 
did you ever keep a journal
when you were a kid 
mmm  yeah 
on and off  i guess 
it s funny 
i read  uh   
one of mine
from  83 the other day 
yeah 
and what really
surprised me is
that i was dealing with life
the same way i am now 
i was much more hopeful
and naive 
mm hmm 
but the core and the way
i was feeling things
is exactly the same 
mmm 
it made me realize
i haven t changed much at all 
yeah  i don t think
anybody does 
i mean  people don t
wanna admit it 
but it s  like 
we just  
we have these innate
set points  you know 
uh huh 
and it s  like 
nothing much
that happens to us
changes our disposition 
really  you believe that 
i think so 
i read this study
where they followed people
who d won the lottery
mm hmm 
and people who d
become paraplegics  right 
i mean  you d think that 
you know  one extreme
is gonna make you euphoric
and the other suicidal 
but the study shows
that after about six months 
mm hmm 
right  it  
as soon as people had gotten
used to their new situation 
uh  they were
more or less the same 
the same 
well   yeah 
like  if they were basically
an optimistic  jovial person 
mm hmm 
they re now an optimistic 
jovialerson in a wheelchair 
if they re a petty 
miserable asshole 
okay  they re a petty 
miserable asshole
with a new cadillac 
a house and a boat 
 chuckles 
so you mean
i ll be forever depressed
no matter what great things
happen in my life 
definitely 
great 
no  come on 
are you depressed now 
no  no 
i m not depressed   
but sometimes i worry
that i ll get
to the end of my life 
feeling i haven t done
all i wanted to do 
well  what do you
want to do 
 sighs 
i  um   
i want to paint more 
i want to
play my guitar everyday 
i want to learn chinese 
i want to write more songs 
there s so many things
i want to do 
and i end up doing
not much 
 laughs 
all right 
well  let me ask you this 
do you believe in  like  uh 
what 
ghosts or spirits 
uh   no 
no 
no 
okay  what about
reincarnation 
not at all 
god 
no 
 both laugh 
all right 
that   that sounds terrible 
no  no  no 
but at the same time
i don t want to be
one of those people
that don t believe
in any kind of magic 
you know 
oh  so then astrology 
yes  of course 
there we go 
i mean  that makes sense  right 
right  obviously 
i mean  you re a scorpio 
i m a sag  we get along 
 both laugh 
no    no  no 
there s an einstein quote
i really  really like 
he said 
 if you don t believe
 in any kind of
magic or mystery 
you re basically
as good as dead  
hmm  yeah  i like that 
yeah
i ve always felt
there was
some kind of mystical core
to the universe  you know 
but more recently 
i ve started to think that   
that me  you know 
my personality  whatever 
mm hmm 
that i don t have
any permanent place here 
mm hmm 
you know  in eternity
or whatever  you know 
and the more i think that 
i can t go through life 
saying that this is
no big deal  you know 
i mean  this is it 
this is actually happening 
what do you think
is interesting 
what do you think
is funny 
what do you think
is important  you know 
every day is our last 
 chuckles 
when i feel that way 
i usually call my mom
to tell her
how much i love her   
yeah 
and she s always 
 are you okay 
do you have cancer 
 laughs 
are you gonna commit suicide  
it s almost
not worth it 
so  uh   
so  what about us 
what about us 
look  i   
what i mean is 
um   
if we were both
going to die tonight  
what  like 
if the apocalypse was coming 
no  no 
that s too dramatic 
but what if  you know 
just the two of us
were going to die 
i mean   
hmmm 
would we talk
about your book 
the environment  or    
if today
was our last day 
yeah  what would
we talk about 
what would you tell me 
for example 
well   
that s hard  huh 
no  well  
no  i ll do it 
i definitely would stop
talking about my book 
okay 
i have to admit
i would probably
drop the environment 
okay 
but i would still  ih6t want to
talk about  you know 
the magic in the universe 
mm hmm 
i d just want to
do it from a   
what 
a hotel room  you know 
in between sessions of us
wildly fucking until we die 
wow 
well  why waste time
with an hotel room 
why not do it
right there on a bench 
okay  come on 
no 
come here 
come here  come here 
no 
 laughs 
okay 
we re not gonna
die tonight 
all right  too bad 
okay 
yeah 
i m sorry 
that was
an extreme example 
i was   okay 
i m sorry 
what i  
my point was  you know 
to truly communicate
with people
is very hard to do 
no  i know  i mean 
most of our   
most of our day to day
exchanges  
yeah  i know  i mean 
not to bring everything
back to sex  but  
but why not 
no  no 
this example 
this friend of mine 
she was talking about
she and her boyfriend 
problems in bed   
right 
and how when they had
been dating for a year 
she started telling him
what he could do
to please her more 
and it totally freaked him out 
why 
totally 
well  he felt all threatened 
and he thought it meant
he was a bad lover   
maybe she shouldn t have
waited so long 
after a year 
well  yeah 
but men are
so easily offended 
oh  what  more than women 
you think 
oh  definitely
on that subject 
you think so 
yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah 
hmm 
well  maybe it s because 
you know   
men are easier to 
you know   
to please 
to please 
well  i don t know 
yeah 
yeah  they are 
they definitely  
definitely 
anyway  this friend of mine 
she was telling me
that  um  next time
she dates another man 
she s gonna make
a little questionnaire
about what they like
and dislike before they  
what  like  written down
or out loud 
yeah  yeah  written down 
mostly written down   
but it wouldn t be
just  you know  yes or no 
it would be a bit more
complex than that 
like what 
for example  if the question is   
 are you into s and m  
uh  the answer could be 
 no  but   
a good spanking
once in a while doesn t hurt  
right 
right  or like  what 
 do you   
so do you like
talking dirty in bed  
that kind of thing 
yeah  yeah  yeah  but not
just like any dirty talk 
mm hmm 
just like   what specific word
would you like to hear  
you know 
right  what  me 
well  yeah 
like  for example  like 
what specific word
would you like to hear 
i don t know 
um   
what do you feel
about the word  pussy  
i   love it 
good 
 laughs 
it s azing
what perverts we ve become
i know  i know 
in the past nine years 
well  at least now
we don t have to pretend
that each new sexual experience
is  like  a life altering event 
i know  by now i know
you ve stuck it
in so many places 
it s  like 
about to fall off  right 
mmm  yeah  you know 
i can t realistically expect
u ve become
anything but a total ho
at this point  you know 
yeah  thank you 
 laughs 
no  i m s  
that s true 
what can you do 
hmm  what can you do 
so   
 clears throat 
what kind of songs
do you write 
i didn t know
you did that 
what kind 
yeah  sure 
i don t know  just songs 
like  
like  some are about

in new delhi 
and we passed a bum
that was lying down  
a bomb 
a bum 
a bum 
a homeless 
 laughs 
all right 
all right 
anyway  like  he looked
like he needed help 
but his first reaction
was to photograph him 
he went  like 
really close to his face 
fixing his collar
to make it look better 
he was  like  totally detached
from the person 
yeah  but don t you kind of
have to be like that
to be good at that job

yeah  so we ll
be there in   
i don t know 
it s the next stop 
okay  au revoir 
okay 
yeah  yeah 
oh  wow 
notre dame  man 
check that out 
oh  wow 
i heard this story once
about when the germans
were occupying paris 
and they had
to retreat back 
they wired
notre dame to blow 
but they had to  
they had to leave one guy
in charge
of hitting the switch 
and the guy 
the soldier  he  
he couldn t do it 
you know  he just
sat there knocked out
by how beautiful
the place was   
and then when
the allied troops came in 
they found all the explosives
just lying there 
and the switch unturned 
and they found
the same thing
at the sacré coeur 
eiffel tower   
a couple other places 
i think 
is that true 
i don t know 
i always liked
the story  though 
yeah  that s
a great story 
but you have to think
that notre dame will
be gone one day 
there used to
be another church
or cathedral at the seine 
right there 
what  right in the same spot 
yeah 
hmm 
yeah  this is great 
i ve never done this 
yeah 
i forget about
how beautiful paris is 
this isn t so bad 
being a tourist  huh 
thank you for getting me
on the boat 
oh  you re welcome 
you know  i think
that book that i wrote 
in a way  was like
building something
so that
i wouldn t forget
the details of the time
that we spent together 
you know  like 
just as a reminder that   
that once we really did meet 
you know  that this was real 
this happened 
i m happy you re saying that 
because  
i mean  i always feel
like a freak
because i m never able
to move on like this 
you know 
people just
have an affair
or even
entire relationships 
they break up
and they forget 
they move on like they would ve
changed brand of cereals 
i feel i was never able
to forget anyone i ve been with 
because each person had
their own   
specific qualities 
you can never
replace anyone 
what is lost is lost 
each relationship 
when it ends really damages me 
i never fully recover 
that s why i m very careful with
getting involved because   
it hurts too much 
even getting laid 
 laughs 
i actually don t do that because   
i will miss of the person
the most mundane things 
like  i m obsessed
with little things 
maybe i m crazy 
but   when i was a little girl 
my mom told me that i was
always late to school 
one day she followed me
to see why 
i was looking at chestnuts
falling from the trees 
rolling on the sidewalk 
or ants crossing the road 
the way a leaf cast a shadow
on a tree trunk 
little things 
i think it s
the same with people 
i see in them
little details 
so specific
to each of them 
that move me 
and that i miss
and will always miss 
you can never replace anyone 
because everyone is made of such
beautiful  specific details 
like i remember the way
your beard has
a bit of red in it 
and how the sun was
making it glow that   
that morning
right before you left 
i remembered that 
and i missed it 
really crazy  right 
all right 
now i know for sure 
you wanna know why
i wrote that stupid book 
why 
so that you might
come to a reading
in paris 
and i could walk up to you
and ask 
 where the fuck were you  
 chuckles 
no  you think
i d be here today 
i m serious 
i think i   
i wrote it in a way
to try to find you 
okay  that s  
i know that s not true 
but that s sweet of you
to say 
well  i think
it is true 
what do you think
the chances were
of us ever meeting again 
after that december 
i d say almost zero 
but we re not real anyway 
right 
we re just characters
in that old lady s dream 
she s on her deathbed
fantasizing about her youth 
so of course
we had to meet again 
 groans 
oh  god 
why weren t you there in vienna 
i told you why 
yeah  i know why 
i just   
i wish you would have been 
our lives might have been
so much different 
 quietly  you know 
do you think so 
i actually do 
maybe not 
maybe we would have
hated each other eventually 
oh  what  like we hate
each other now 
you know 
maybe we re   
we re only good
at brief encounters
walking around
in european cities 
in warm climate 
 chuckles 
oh  god  why didn t we exchange
phone numbers and stuff 
why didn t we do that 
because we were
young and stupid 
do you think we still are 
i guess when you re young 
you just believe
there will be many people
with whom you ll connect with 
and later in life  you realize
it only happens a few times 
yeah  and you can
screw it up 
you know  misconnect 
well  the past
is the past 
it was meant
to be that way 
what  you really
believe that 
that everything s fated 
well   you know 
the world might be
less free than we think 
yeah 
yeah  when given
these exact circumstances 
that s what will
happen every time 
two part hydrogen 
one part oxygen 
you ll get water
every time 
no  no  no  i mean 
what if your grandmother had
lived a week longer  you know 
or passed away a week earlier 
days  even  you know 
things might ve been different 
i believe that 
no  you can t think
like that  it s  
no  i mean  i know you shouldn t
on most things  but   
it s just it   
on this one  it seemed like
something was off  you know 
i mean   
in the months leading up
to my wedding  okay 
i was thinking abo 
i mean 
even on my way there 
i m in the car 
and a buddy of mine
is driving me downtown 
and i m staring
out the window 
and i think i see you
not far from
the church  right 
folding up an umbrella
and walking into a deli
on the corner
of 13th and broadway   
and i thought i was
going crazy  you know 
but now i think
it probably was you 
i lived on
11th and broadway 
 softly 
you see 
 inhales 
so   what is it like
to be married 
you haven t talked much
about that 
i haven t 
how weird 
i don t know 
we met   
you know 
when i was in college 
and  uh  we broke up 
and got back together
for a period of years 
and then  um   
what  we were
sort of back together 
and she was pregnant   
so marriage 
what is she like 
she s a great teacher 
a good mom 
uh  she s smart  pretty 
you know 
i remember thinking
at the time
that   so many of the men
that i admired most  you know 
that their lives were   
were dedicated to something
greater than themselves 
so you got married
because men you admired
were married 
no  no  no  it   
it s more like i had this idea
of my best self  you know 
and i wanted
to pursue that 
even if it might ve been
overriding my honest self 
do you know
what i m saying 
i mean 
it s funny  like 
in the moment
i remember thinking
that it didn t much matter
the who of it all 
i mean  that nobody
is gonna be everything to you 
and that ultimately
it s just the simple action of
committing yourself  you know 
meeting your responsibilities 
that matters 
i mean 
what is love  right 
if it s not respect 
trust  admiration 
and i   i felt
all those things 
so cut to
the present tense 
and i feel like
i m running a small nursery
with somebody
i used to da  you know 
i mean  i m like a monk 
you know 
i mean  i ve had sex
less than   
10 times
in the last four years 
 laughs 
what  what  what 
you laughing at me 
no 
it sounds pathetic 
what monastery do the monk
have sex 10 times 
okay  you re right 
 laughs 
i m doing better
than most monks  all right 
but i do  i feel like
if somebody were to touch me 
you know  i would dissolve
into molecules 
well  we re here 
we ve gotta go 
come on 
shit 
 speaking french 
bonsoir 
bonsoir 
bonsoir 
oh  sacré coeur 
i m sorry to hear that 
what 
you know  you re not that
happy with your marriage 
well  this friend of mine 
she s a shrink and  
yeah  how s she doing 
she s a mess  but  
 both laugh 
no  she was telling me
that she s been dealing
with a lot of couples
that are breaking up
for the same exact reason 
mmm  what reason
is that 
well  all
those couples expected
after a few years
of living together
for the passion  that consuming
desire  to be the same
than in the beginning 
yeah  right 
it s impossible 
no  i know that 
and thank god 
otherwise we would end up
with aneurysms if we were
in that constant state
of excitement  right 
we would end up doing nothing
at all with our lives 
do you think you would
have finished your book
if you were fucking
someone every five minutes 
i might have
welcomed the challenge 
no   
 both laugh 
but  you know 
it s natural for your wife
after the birth of your son 
no 
she has to giveall her love
to the little one 
of course 
imagine if she was
totally obsessed with sex 
riding you
like a wild cat 
that wouldn t make
any sense  right 
no  no  it wo  
everything you re
saying makes sense 
it s  
it s not about sex 
no  i know 
it s obvious 
i  um   
you know  couples
are so confused lately 
i think
it must be that   
men need to feel essential 
and they don t anymore 
because it s been
imprinted in their head
for so many years
that they have
to be the provider 
like  i   i m a strong 
independent woman
in my professional life 
really 
i don t need a man
to feed me 
but i still need a man
to love me
and that i could love 
you know 
so  uh   
your driver s here 
yeah 
well  i guess
this is goodbye 
you better give me your  
no  why don t we just
give you a ride home 
wherever you re going  huh 
well  i can take
the métro  i m fine 
no  no  no  no  no 
my flight s
not until 10 00  right 
they ve got me arriving
two hours early 
it s not really  
this way we can keep talking 
no  no  monsieur 
it s not really on the way 
can    
 speaks french 
oui 
 speaks french 
 both speaking french 
so you told him where you are 
and all that jazz 
yeah 
 celine speaks french 
 engine starts 
so he knows where he s going 
yes 
glad somebody does 
 chuckles 
no  but this is better
than the métro  right 
definitely 
i was thinking 
for me it s better
i don t romanticize things
as much anymore 
i was suffering so much
all the time 
i still have
lots of dreams 
but they re not in regard
to my love life 
it doe t make me sad 
it s just the way it is 
is that why you re in
a relationship
with somebody
who s never around 
 chuckles 
yes  obviously i can t deal
with the day to day life
of a relationship 
yeah  we have  you know 
this exciting time together 
and then he leaves 
and i miss him 
but at least
i m not dying inside 
when someone
is always around me 
i m  like  suffocating 
no  wait  you just said that
you need to love and be loved 
yeah  but when i do  it
quickly makes me nauseous 
 laughs 
it s a disaster 
i mean  i m really happy
only when i m on my own 
even being alone 
it s better than   
sitting next to a lover
and feeling lonely 
it s not so easy
for me
to be a romantic 
you start off that way 
and after you ve been
screwed over a few times 
you   you forget about
all your delusional ideas 
and you just take
what comes into your life 
that s not even true 
i haven t been
screwed over 
i ve just had too many
 blah  relationship 
they weren t mean 
they cared for me 
but there were no real
connection or excitement 
at least 
not from my side 
god  i m sorry  is it   
is it really that bad 
it s not  right 
you know   
it s not even that 
i was   i was fine   
until i read your fucking book 
it stirred shit up 
you know 
it reminded me
how genuinely romantic i was 
how i had so much hope
in things 
and now it s like   
i don t believe in anything
that relates to love 
i don t feel things
for people anymore 
in a way   
i put all my romanticism
into that one night 
and i was never able
to feel all this again 
hey 
like  somehow this night
took things away from me 
and i exprsed them to you 
and you took them with you 
it made me feel cold 
like if love wasn t for me 
no  no 
i don t believe that 
 sighs 
i don t believe that 
you know what 
reality and love
are almost contradictory for me 
it s funny 
every single of my exes 
they re now married 
men go out with me 
we break up 
and then they get married 
 chuckles 
and later they call me
to thank me
for teaching them what love is 
oh  god   
and that i taught them
to care and respect women 
yeah  i think i m
one of those guys 
you know 
i want to kill them 
why didn t they ask me
to marry them 
i would have said no  but
at least they could ve asked 
but it s my fault 
i know it s my fault
because i never felt
it was the right man 
never 
but what does it mean 
the right man  the love of your
life  the concept is absurd 
the idea that we can only be
complete with another person
is evil  right 
can i talk 
you know   
i guess i ve been
heartbroken
too many times 
and then i recovered 
so now  you know 
from the starts 
i make no effort 
because i know
it s not gonna work out 
you can t  you can t do that 
you can t live your life
trying to avoid pain
at the expense  
okay  you know what 
those are words 
i ve gotta get away from you 
stop the car 
i wanna get out 
no  don t  
no  it s  
don t get out 
you know what 
keep talking 
it s being around you 
no  don t touch me 
okay 
i wanna get a cab 
 speaks french 
monsieur  monsieur   
no  no  no  just  
don t   keep going 
keep  
hey  no  listen 
i m just so happy  
 sighs 
thank you 
just keep going 
all right 
 sighs 
look  i am just so happy 
all right  to be with you 
i am  i m so glad
you didn t forget about me 
okay 
no  i didn t 
and it pisses me off 
okay 
you come here to paris 
all romantic and married  okay 
screw you 
don t get me wrong 
i m not trying
to get you or anything 
i mean  all i need
is a married man   
and there s been so much
water under the bridge 
it s not even about you anymore 
it s about that time 
that moment in time 
that is forever gone 
i don t know 
you say all that 
but you didn t even
remember having sex  so   
of course i remembered 
you did 
yes 
women pretend things
like that  i don t know 
they do 
yeah  what was i
supposed to say 
that i remember
the wine in the park 
and us looking up
at the stars fading away
as the sun came up 
we had sex twice 
you idiot 
 chuckles 
 chuckles 
all right 
you know what 
i m just happy to see you 
even if you ve become
an angry  manic depressive
activist  i still like you 
 giggles 
i still enjoy being around you 
and i feel the same 
i m sorry  i don t know
what happened 
i just    i had to
let it all out 
ah  don t worry about it 
i m so miserable
in my love life 
 exhales 
in my relationship 
i always act as  like 
you know  i m detached 
but i m dying inside 
i m dying because
i m so numb 
i don t feel pain
or excitement 
i m not even bitter 
i m just   
you think you re
the one dying inside 
my life is 24 7 bad 
 giggles 
i m sorry 
no  no 
i mean 
the only happiness i get
is when i m out
with my son 
i ve been
to marriage counseling 
i ve done things
i never thought
i would have to do 
i ve lit candles 
bought self help books 
lingerie   
did the candles help 
hell  no  all right 
i don t love her the way
she needs to be loved 
and i don t even
see a future for us 
but then i look
at my little boy   
sitting at the table
across from me 
and i think i would suffer
any torture to be with him
for all the minutes
of his life  you know 
don t want to
miss out on one 
but then  th there s no joy
or laughter in my home 
you know 
and i don t want him
growing up in that 
ah  no laughter 
that s terrible 
my parents have been
together for 35 years 
and even when
they have a bad fight 
they end up
laughing like crazy 
yeah  i just   i don t want
to be one of those people
who are getting
divorced at 52 
and falling down
into tears 
admitting that they never
really loved their spouse 
and they feel their life
has been   
sucked up into
a vacuum cleaner 
you know  i want a great life 
i want her to have a great life 
she deserves that 
all right 
but we re just living
in the pretense of a marriage 
responsibility  you know 
all these  just   
ideas of how people
are supposed to live   
but then i   
i have these dreams 
what dreams 
i have these dreams 
you know  that  um   
i m standing on a platform   
and  uh   
what 
you keep going by
on a train 
and   
you go by 
and you go by 
and you go by 
you go by 
and i wake up with
the fucking sweats  you know 
and then i have
this other dream   
ohhhh  where you re pregnant
in bed beside me naked 
and i want so badly
to touch you 
but you tell me not to 
and then
you look away  and  
and i  
i touch you anyway   
right on your ankle 
and your skin is so soft
that i wake up in sobs 
all right 
 sighs 
and my wife is sitting there
looking at me 
and i feel like
i m a million miles from her 
and i know that
there s something wrong 
you know  that i  
 groans 
god  that i can t keep living
like this  that there s gotta be
something more to love
than commitment 
but then i think
that i might ve given up
on the whole idea
of romantic love
that i   i might have
put it to bed that   
that day when
you weren t there 
you know  i think
i might ve done that 
why are you telling me
all this 
i m sorry 
i don t know 
i   i shouldn t have 
i shouldn t have 
you know  it s so weird 
people think
they are
the only ones
going through
tough times 
i mean  when i read
the article 
i thought
your life was perfect 
 both chuckle 
a wife  a kid 
published author 
 laughs 
but your personal life
is more of a mess than mine 
mmmm   
i m sorry 
well  i m glad it s good
for something 
 speaks french

this is where you live 
yeah 
so are you just relieved
that i m in even more
deep shit than you are 
yes  you ve made me
feel better 
oh  good  i m glad 
 laughs 
no  i really
wish you the best 
 sighs 
it s not because
i m incapable of having
a good relationship
or a family
that i wish everyone
to be doomed like me 
i m sure you make  
be a great mom someday 
really  you think so 
oh  yeah 
a few anti depressants

 laughs  oh  no
