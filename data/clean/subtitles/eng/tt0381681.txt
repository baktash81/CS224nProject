sitting outside
in the sunshine
but soon
well be apart
and soon
itll be night in bloom
now things are fine
the clouds are far away
up in the sky
but soon
ill be on a plane
and soon
youll feel the cold rain
you promised
to stay in touch
when were apart
you promised
before i left
that youll always love me
time goes by and people cry
and everything
goes too fast
woman
do you consider the book
to be autobiographical
mmhmm um well i mean
isnt everything
autobiographical
i mean we all see the world
through our own
tiny keyhole right
i mean i always think
of thomas wolfe
you know have you
ever seen that
that little onepage
note to reader
in the front of
look homeward angel
right you know
whatm talking about
anyway hhe says that
we are the sum
of all the moments of our lives
and that anybody
who sits down to write
is gonna use the clay
of their own life
that you cant avoid that
so when i look at my own life
you know
i have to admit right
that ive
ive never been around
a bunch of guns or violence
you know not really
nopolitical intrigue
or helicopter crash right
but my life
from my own point of view
has been full of drama right
and uh so i thought
if i could write a book that
that could capture
what its like
to really meet somebody
i mean one of the most
exciting things
thats ever
happened to me right
is to really meet somebody
make that connection
and if i could
make that valuable
you know to capture that
that would be
the attempt or
did i answer your question
i
ill try to be more specific
okay
okay
were there ever
a french young woman on a train
you met
and spent an evening with
ahhh
um
see to me that
i mean uh
thats not important
you know
woman
so thats a yes
all right
since im in france
and this is the last stop
of my book tour
yes
crowd laughing
thank you
mr wallace um
the book ends
on an ambiguous note
we dont know
ddo you think they get
back together
in six months
like they promise each other
jesse
like they promised um
i think i answered that
you know its a
its a good test right
if youre a romantic
or a cynic
right i mean
you think you think
they get back together right
you dont for sure
no
and you hope they do
but you know youre not sure
thats why youre
asking the question
and and do you think
they get back together
i mean did you
in real life
sighs
did i in real
man laughs
look in the words
of my grandfather okay
to answer that
would take the piss
out of the whole thing
oh no
speaks french
we just have
the time
for one last question hmm
what
what is your next book
uh
i dont know man
i dont know
ive been
ive been thinking about this
well i always
kind of wanted to write a book
that all took place
within the space of a pop song
you know
like three or four minutes long
the whole thing
the story the idea
is that theres this guy
all right and
hes totally depressed
i mean his great dream
was to be a lover
an adventurer
you know riding motorcycles
through south america
and instead hes sitting at
a marble table eating lobster
and hes got a good job
and a beautiful wife right
but you know
everything that he needs
but that d doesnt matter
because what he wants
is to fight for meaning
you know
i mean happiness
is in the doing right
not in the getting
what you want
so hes sitting there
and just that second
his little 5yearold daughter
hops up on the table
and he knows
that she should get down
because she could get hurt
but shes dancing
to this pop song
in a summer dress
and he looks down
and all of a sudden
hes 16
and his highschool sweetheart
is dropping him off at home
and they just lost
their virginity
and she loves him
and the same song
is playing on the car radio
and she climbs up
and starts dancing
on the roof of the car
and now now
hes worried about her
and shes beautiful with a
a facial expression you know
just like his daughters
in fact you know maybe
thats why he even likes her
you know i mean see
he knows hes not
remembering this dance
hes there
hes there in
in both moments
simultaneously
and just like for an instant
all his life is just
folding in on itself
and its obvious
to him that time is a lie
uh
that its all happening
all the time
and inside every moment
is another moment all
you know
happening simultaneously
and anyway thats
thats kind of the idea
anyway
well our author
has to be going
to the airport soon

i honestly thought
that something like that
mightve happened
i was definitely bummed
sighs
butmostly
i was just mad
we hadnt exchanged
any phone numbers
or any information
i know
i know
that was so stupid
no way to get in touch
we had nothing to go on
i didnt know
your last name nothing
i know i know remember
we were both afraid
that if we started
writing and calling
that it would slowly
you know fade out
yeah it definitely
wasnt a slow fade
no it sure wasnt
laughs
i know we wanted to
pick it up where we left off
which wouldve been fine
if it had worked
yes a good idea yep
oh well
sighs
so
so
how long were you
in vienna then
eh just a couple days
did you meet
another girl
uh yeah
her name was gretchen
and she was amazing
you did
yeah the books really
a composite of the two of you
really oh no
no im kidding
you wouldnt believe it
i even went back
to the train station
i put up signs you know
of my number at the hotel
oh
in case youd been delayed
i was a total dork
lets go this way
did you get any calls
just a couple hookers
looking for a gig you know
no
it was awful
i mean what do you
want me to say like
oh thats so sad
im so sorry
i walked around
for a couple days
eventually i flew home
i owed my dad 2000 bucks
who had warned me about
french chicks i have to say
what did he tell you
about french women
nothing the guy
hes never met any french women
okay
hes never been east
of the mississippi
so why didnt you put
that six months later
the french bitch
didnt show up
no but i did i did
you did no
yeah no
i mean i made it
more hopeful
i i wrote this
whole fictional version
where you actually
do show up
oh what happens
well um
what
uh we
we make love
for about 10 days straight
thats one part of it
oh thats interesting
so the french slut right
yeah exactly
yeah okay great okay
its just then
you know they
they start to get to
know each other better
and they realize that
they dont get along at all
oh i like that
its more real
yeah well my editor
didnt think that way
no everyone wants
to believe in love
it sells right
yeah exactly so
so things are going well
for you right
i mean your book
is a bestseller in the us
yeah er its
a tiny bestseller
oh come on
no uh
all right yeah right
officially yes
but most people havent read
moby dick you know
so why should
they read my book
i havent read moby dick
and i liked your book so
oh thanks
i mean
even though
chuckles
i thought you idealized
the night of it
oh come on
its officially
fiction right
no no
i mean im supposed to
i know i know
i thought you know
there were times
where you made me
gasps
what
well i mean
her right
no me
okay whatever
uh a little bit neurotic
all right but you are a little
bit like that arent you
you think im neurotic
no no no
no come on
im kidding
where did i do that
i didnt do that
well maybe its just me
you know um
reading something
knowing that the character
in the story is based on you
its bothflattering
and disturbing at the same time
yeah hhow is
it disturbing
i dont know
um just being part of
someone elses memory
seeing myself
through your eyes
how long did it
take you to write it
um uh
three or four years
on and off
wow thats
a really long time
to be writing
about one night
yeah i know
tell me about it
groans
i always assumed
you had forgotten me
chuckles
no i had a pretty clear picture
of you in my mind
i have to tell you
something
i just
what
ive wanted to
talk to you for so long
but now
yeah me too
its just surreal
i know i know
i feel like everything
out of my mouth should be
how long do we have
twenty minutes and 30 seconds
lets go
no we got more than that
i want to know about you
tell me what are you doing
you know
what are you up to
uh where to start
i uh
i work for green cross
its an environmental
organization
yeah what are
they all about
well we basically work
on different
environment issues
from clean water
right
to disarmament
of chemical weapons
you know
international laws
that deal
with the environment
and whwhat do you
do for them
were going this way
oh
uh different things
like last year i was in india
for quite a while
working on
a watertreatment plant
wow
yeah well
the cotton industry there
is a major source
of pollution so
i mean itust sounds
like youre actually
doing something
you know
i mean most people
myself included
just sit around
and bitch
americas consuming
all the worlds resources
yep
suvs suck
global warming is real
you know im really
relieved to hear
youre not one of those
freedom fries
kind of americans
yeah well
hey you know
but howd you
get into that
ah i came out
of political science
and i was hoping to work
for the government
and i did
for a little while
ugh terrible
not good
yeah no anyway
i got really tired
lets go this way
of having this endless
conversation with friends
about how the world
was falling to pieces
so i decided
what i really wanted to do
was to find things
that could be fixed
and try to fix them
you know
yeah you know i just
well
ive always thought youd be
doing something cool like that
i did i
thanks
i just
i just feel really
really lucky to be doing
a job i like you know
yeah
you know
i actually alternated
between thinking that
you know
everything is
irrevocably screwed up
and that things might be
getting better in some ways
better how could you
possibly say that
well i just mean
you know like
i mean i know
it sounds weird
but there are things
to be optimistic about
okay
um i know your book is selling
which is great
im very happy for you
i
but let me break
the news to you okay
the world is a mess right now
im not
i wasnt
from a western point of view
things are getting
a bit better okay
were moving all our industry
to developing nations
i know
where we can get cheap labor
free of any
environmental laws okay
the weapon industry
is booming
five million people
die every year
from preventable water diseases
right i know i
so how is the world
getting any better
im not getting angry
but come on i want to know
im interested
okay okay
i realize
sighs
that there are a lot of
serious problems in the world
okay thank you
okay
i mean i dont
even have one publisher
in the whole asian market
okay all right
laughs
say stop
what what
stop
ohhh
no look all im saying
is theres more awareness
out there right
people are gonna fight back
okay
you know i mean
i mean i think the world
might be getting better
because people like you
are educated and speaking out
even the very notion
of conservation
and environmental issues
yeah
those werent even
in the vocabulary
until fairly recently
you know
and theyre becoming
the norm
and eventually
might be whats expected
all over the world
youd think
i agree with
what youre saying
but at the same time
its dangerous
an imperialist country
can use that kind
of thinking
to justify
their economic greed
yeah
you know hu human rights
is there any particular
imperialist country
you have in mind
there frenchie
hmm no not really
no
mmmmm
bonsoir
bonsoir
sighs
so you want
to sit over there
yeah all this is perfect
oh wow
maybe what im saying is
is the world might be
evolving the way
a person evolves right
mmhmmm
like i mean me for example
am i getting worse
am i improving
i dont know
when i was younger
i was healthier
but i was uh wracked
with insecurity you know
now im older
and my problems are deeper
but im more equipped
to handle them
so what are
your problems
right now
i dont have any
i dont you know
im just
inhales
damn happy to be here
me too
so how long have you
been in paris
i got in last night ive done
10 cities in 12 days and im
im wrecked im so glad
its over you know
im tired of being
a huckster
hello
speaks french
what do you want
um a cup of coffee
speaks french
sighs
god i love this café
i wish they had places
like this in the us
yeah i missed cafés
when i was living over there
i mean i find a few places
i really liked
but there was
wait you
you were living in the us
yes from uh
96 to 99
i was studying at nyu
oh god
dont tell me that celine
what
no no its just
nothing i mean i
what
ive been living in new york
since 98 you know
we were there at the same time
in new york
yeah
wow thats weird
it actually crossed my mind
a few times
that i might run into you
but the odds are so
slim right so
i didnt even know
what city you were living in
werent you
somewhere in texas
point texas
yeah yeah yeah definitely
i just
i was for a long time
i justyou know
wanted to try new york
hmmm wow
what brought you
back here
uh i had finished
my masters for one
and no visa
no more visa
and anyway i was
starting to get paranoid
all the violence
in the medias
gang violence murders
oh yeah right
especially
serial killers
laughs
but the final straw was
one night i heard some noise
on my fire escape
so i called 911
and the cops came
eventually
yeah three hours later
yeah after id been
raped and killed
about three times
laughs
no but it was a man
and a woman officer
and i was explaining to them
what i had heard
when the woman
had to run downstairs
to move the police car
so i was left alone
with the male cop
and right away he asked me
if i had a gun
and i said
no of course not i
and he told me
well youd better think
about getting one
this is america
not france
okay and i said to him
you know
i have no idea
how to shoot a gun
and i have no interest
in firearms whatsoever
and thats when he pulled out
his gun like this
and he went
well one day
youre gonna have something
like this in your face
and if you wanna have
a long life
youre gonna have to choose
between you or them
and then they left
and the next morning
i called for an application
to get a gun
laughs
me with a gun
i mean
thats really scary
but then i realized
something was wrong
the way that cop
had pulled his gun out
and everything right
yeah sure
so i cancelled
my demand for the gun
and i called
the police station
and tried to complain
about that cops behavior but
what happened with that
it was so much paperwork
laughs
and then i got
scared with my shitty
student visa
yeah he thought
youd get deported
yeah exactly
yeah
so i gave up and i forgot about
the whole thing
well i guess
i never forgot
well obviously
ill get through
yeah
chuckles
but still you know
sighs
i really enjoyed
being there
theres a lot of things
i miss about the us
yeah like what
um
well
the overall good mood
people have there
like you know even if
it can be bullshit sometimes
like how you doing
great how you doing
great
laughs
have a great day
i dont know
parisians can be so grumpy
have you noticed
mmm no everybody seems
no
pretty happy to me
mmm theyre not happy
theyre not happy
nnnn no
both laugh
no they are
i dont know really
i just mean french men
they drive me nuts
what is it
what about them
well theyre very nice
they
theyre great you know
to be around
they love food wine
theyre great cooks
but i dont know
maybe ive ive had
really bad luck with them
well why
what do you mean
um well
i guess
theyre not as
what
whats the word
um
horny
laughs
theyre not as horny
horny
all right now wait
now listen to me on this one
all right in that regard
i am proud to be an american
and you should be
in that regard only
merci
have you ever spent some time
in eastern europe
eastern no i dont
no
thank you
i remember as a teenager
i went to warsaw
when it was still
a strict communist regime
which i dont
approve of at all
oh yeah sure you do
no i dont
no i was just kidding
but anyway
something about being there
was very interesting
i found
after a couple of weeks
something changed in me
the city was
quite gloomy and gray and
but after a while
my brain seemed clearer
i was writing a lot more
in my journal
ideas id never
thought of before
communist ideas
listen i am not
a communist no
sorry i cant
well okay
go on
okay
both laugh
ill send you to a gulag
okay
no well it took me a while
to figure out
why i felt you know
so different
and then one day
as i was walking through
the jewish cemetery
i dont know why
but it occurred to me there
i realized that i had spent
the last two weeks
away from most of my habits
tv was in a language
i didnt understand
there was nothing to buy
no advertisements anywhere
so all id been doing
was
walk around think
and write
my brain felt like
it was at rest
free from
the consuming frenzy
and i have to say it was
almost like a natural high
i felt so peaceful
inside
no strange urge
to be somewhere else
to shop
mmhmm
maybe it could have seemed
like boredom at first
but it quickly became
very very soulful
hmm
it was interesting
you know
can you believe
it was nine years ago
that we were
walking around vienna
nine years
no thats impossible
nine i was
i know it feels
like two months ago to me
but it was summer 94
mmhmm
do i look any different
i do
id have to see you naked
what
i know im sorry
both laugh
no your hair was
different back then
it was like
well its the same
yeah take it down
lets see
down it was down okay
yeah
well voilà
so
well
okay come on tell me
uh
skinnier i think
little thinner
did you think
i was fat before
no
laughs
yeah you thought
i was a fatty
no you thought
i was a fatty
yeah you wrote a book
about a fat french girl
no listen
oh no
seriously all right
you look beautiful
do i look any different
no
mmm
not at all
oh actually
you have this line
i know
its like a scar
a scar
what like a gunshot wound
laughs
no no no i like it
im sorry
i had thisfunny
wellhorrible dream
the other day um
i was having
this awful nightmare
that i was 32
really
and then i woke up
and i was 23
so relieved
right
and then i woke up for real
and i was 32
shit i know
scary
it happens
yeah time goes
faster and faster
apparently
its because we dont
renew our synapses after 20
so its pretty much
downhill from then on oh well
yeah
laughs
i like getting older
you know
life feels
i dont know
it feels more immediate
mmhmm
you know like
i can appreciate things more
no me too actually
i i really love it
i was once a
a drummer in a band
you were
yeah
we were pretty good actually
wow
mmhmm
but the lead singer guy
he was just so obsessed with us
getting a record deal you know
yeah
its all we talked about
its all we thought about
getting bigger shows
everything was just focused
on the future all the time
and now the
band doesnt even
exist anymore right
and looking back at the
at the shows we did play
even rehearsing you know
it was so much fun
now id be able to enjoy
every minute of it
could i have a drag of that
mmhmm
well your book
has been published
thats thats
a pretty big deal
and youve been
all around europe with it
are you enjoying
every minute of it
not really
not really
no
both laugh
you have
another one of those
yes of course
um
here
in my field i see
these people that
oh sorry
come into it
with big idealist visions
of becoming the new leader
that will create a better world
they enjoy the goal
but not the process
right
but the reality of it is
that the true work
of improving things
is in the little achievements
of the day
and thats what you need
to enjoy to stay in that field
what do you mean here exactly
well for example
i was working
for this organization
that helped
villages in mexico
and their concerns
was how to get the pencils
sent to the kid
in those little country schools
it was not about big
revolutionary ideas
hmm
it was about pencils
i see the people
that do the real work
and whats really sad
in a way is that
the people that are
the most giving hardworking
and capable
of making this world better
usually dont have the ego
and ambition to be a leader
they dont see any interest
in superficial rewards
they dont care
if their name ever appear
in the press
they actually enjoy
the process of helping others
theyre in the moment
yeah but thats so hard
you know to be in the moment
yeah
i mean i just feel
like im
designed to be
slightly dissatisfied
with everything you know
i mean like always trying to
better my situation you know
i satisfy one desire
and it just agitates another
you know but then i think
ah to hell with it right
i mean
desires the fuel of life
yes
i mean do you think
its true that if
if we never wanted anything
wed never be unhappy
i dont know
not wanting anything is
isnt that
a sympm of depression
laughs
yeah that is right
yes i
i mean its healthy
to desire right
yeah i dont know
i mean its what all
those buddhist guys say right
you know
liberate yourself from desire
and youll find that you already
have everything you need
yeah but i feel really alive
when i want something more
than just basic survival needs
i mean wanting whether its
intimacy with another person
or a new pair of shoes
is kind of beautiful
i like that we have
those everrenewing desires
you know
yeah well
maybe its just
a sense of entitlement
you know like
whenever you feel
like you deserve
that new pair of shoes
you know i mean
its okay to want things
as long as
you dont get pissed off
if you dont get them right
yeah
lifes hard
its supposed to be
if we didnt suffer
we wouldnt learn a thing
you know
so what are you
buddhist or something
no
no why not
i dont know uh
same reason i dont
really consider myself
anything really
yeah i know
i decided a long time ago
that i was gonna
be open to everything
but not buy into
any one and only belief system
i went to
this trappist monastery
a couple years ago
trappist
yeah theyre
catholic cistercian
oh
yeah
why did you do that
why id just been doing
some reading i guess
i dont know
i thought itd be cool
have you ever spent any time
with any monks or nuns
no
its not really my style
no
no
both laugh
but go ahead
well i
i expected them to be
all glowering and stern
you know but they werent
they were really quick to laugh
really easy to be around
seriously very attuned
to everything
chuckles
they were just uh
you know they werent
trying to hustle anybody
mmhmm
theyre trying to live
and die in peace with god
you know or whatever part
of them they feel is eternal
you know and it was just
so refreshing to be around
you know you realize that most
of the people that you meet
are trying
to get somewhere better
you know theyre trying
to make a little bit more cash
theyre trying to get
a little more respect
have more people admire them
you know
its just exhausting
no kidding
you know and its exhausting
to be one of those
people yourself you know
laughs
i mean there i am right
you know all greedy
to be more spiritual you know
i wanna be a better person
you know
you cant escape
i had this uh
this boyfriend of mine
many years ago
that wanted to be
a buddhist
so he went to asia to visit
some of those monasteries
yeah i thought
about doing that too
yeah and you should
really
ill tell you why
uh he was
quite goodlooking
and each time he went
to one of those monasteries
a monk offered
to suck his cock
both laugh
true story
well it all comes down to that
doesnt it
mmm
and i think thats why i
really admire what youre doing
you know
what do you mean
sucking cock
uh no
no
both laugh
wrong answer
no yeah
no i was gonna say
uh
you know youre not detached
from life you know
youve put in your
passion into action
well i try

even need to buy anything
i just get high on trying on

any problems that night
no im kidding
we didnt even
have sex anyway
wait thats a joke right
no we didnt
well what
that was the whole thing
no of course we did
no no no no
we didnt
you didnt
have a condom
and i never have sex
without one
especially
on a onenight thing
im extremely paranoid
about my health
theres no way
whoa whoa
im finding this scary
that you dont remember
why no listen
okay i didnt write
an entire book
chuckles
but i kept a journal okay
and i wrote
the whole night in it
thats what i meant
you idealizing the night
all right listen
i even remember what brand
of condom we used
okay thats disgusting
i dont want to hear it
thats not disgusting
no
well
okay you know what
when i get home
ill check my journal from 94
but i know im right
all right
wait a minute
what
was it in the cemetery
scoffs
no
no we went to the cemetery
in the afternoon
it was in the park
very late at night
in the park
park
wait a minute wait a minute
this is
i cant
chuckles
no i
is it that forgettable
i mean
you really dont remember
in the park
okay wait a minute
i i think
you might be right
all right no youre
messing with me now
no
are you messing with me
okay no im sorry
i think youre
i mean
youre right okay
sometime i put things
in drawers inside my head
and forget about it
i guess its less painful
to put certain things away
than to live with it
im sorry its
so that night was
like a sad memory for you
no i didnt mean
that night in particular
i just meant certain things
are better off forgotten
i remember that night
better than i do entire years
me too
really
well i thought i did
uhhuh
both chuckle
but maybe i
maybe i put it away
because of the fact
that my grandmothers
funeral was the day
we were supposed to
meet again
yeah right it was
a tough day for me
but it mustve been
worse for you
it was unreal
i remember looking at
her dead body in the coffin
sighs
at her beautiful hands
so warm so sweet
that used to
hold me but
nothing in that coffin resembled
what i remembered of her
all the warmth was gone
and then i was crying
so confused
if i was crying
because i was
never gonna see her again
or never gonna see
you again or
im sorry
no its all right
im sorry to go
on like this
ive been a little down
this week i dont know
why
i dont know nothing bad
just um
reading your book
maybe
no but thinking
of how hopeful i was
that summer and fall
and since then
its been kind of um
sighs
i dont know
memory is
a wonderful thing
if you dont have to
deal with the past
both laugh
what
memory is
a wonderful thing
if you dont have to
deal with the past
can put that
on a bumper sticker
you know if you wrote
a book about our night
thatd be a good title
yeah and it would be
a total different book
yeah thered be no sex scenes
laughs yeah
but you know what
what
now that weve met again
we can change our memory
of that december 16th
it no longer has
that sad ending
of us never seeing
each other again right
yeah youre right
i mean i guess
a memorys never finished
as long as youre alive
yeah i know
chuckles
i have this memory
from my childhood
that i realized
recently never happened
what
well
when i was
eight nor nine
my mom was so paranoid
when i was walking home
from my piano lesson at night
mmhmm
she would always warn me
about dirty old men
giving me candies
and then showing me
their peepees
laughs
she was
so obsessed with it
that later in life
you know
i i had this image in my head
that this really happened
to the point that
i even associated sex
with that walk home
i mean and sometimes
even now when im
laughs
when im hav
when im having sex
i see myself walking
down that street
laughs
i swear
its so weird right
well
is that street nearby
i mean could
could we no
very far
did you ever keep a journal
when you were a kid
mmm yeah
on and off i guess
its funny
i read uh
one of mine
from 83 the other day
yeah
and what really
surprised me is
that i was dealing with life
the same way i am now
i was much more hopeful
and naive
mmhmm
but the core and the way
i was feeling things
is exactly the same
mmm
it made me realize
i havent changed much at all
yeah i dont think
anybody does
i mean people dont
wanna admit it
but its like
we just
we have these innate
setpoints you know
uhhuh
and its like
nothing much
that happens to us
changes our disposition
really you believe that
i think so
i read this study
where they followed people
whod won the lottery
mmhmm
and people whod
become paraplegics right
i mean youd think that
you know one extreme
is gonna make you euphoric
and the other suicidal
but the study shows
that after about six months
mmhmm
right it
as soon as people had gotten
used to their new situation
uh they were
more or less the same
the same
well yeah
like if they were basically
an optimistic jovial person
mmhmm
theyre now an optimistic
jovialerson in a wheelchair
if theyre a petty
miserable asshole
okay theyre a petty
miserable asshole
with a new cadillac
a house and a boat
chuckles
so you mean
ill be forever depressed
no matter what great things
happen in my life
definitely
great
no come on
are you depressed now
no no
im not depressed
but sometimes i worry
that ill get
to the end of my life
feeling i havent done
all i wanted to do
well what do you
want to do
sighs
i um
i want to paint more
i want to
play my guitar everyday
i want to learn chinese
i want to write more songs
theres so many things
i want to do
and i end up doing
not much
laughs
all right
well let me ask you this
do you believe in like uh
what
ghosts or spirits
uhno
no
no
okay what about
reincarnation
not at all
god
no
both laugh
all right
that that sounds terrible
no no no
but at the same time
i dont want to be
one of those people
that dont believe
in any kind of magic
you know
oh so then astrology
yes of course
there we go
i mean that makes sense right
right obviously
i mean youre a scorpio
im a sag we get along
both laugh
no no no
theres an einstein quote
i really really like
he said
if you dont believe
in any kind of
magic or mystery
youre basically
as good as dead
hmm yeah i like that
yeah
ive always felt
there was
some kind of mystical core
to the universe you know
but more recently
ive started to think that
that me you know
my personality whatever
mmhmm
that i dont have
any permanent place here
mmhmm
you know in eternity
or whatever you know
and the more i think that
i cant go through life
saying that this is
no big deal you know
i mean this is it
this is actually happening
what do you think
is interesting
what do you think
is funny
what do you think
is important you know
every day is our last
chuckles
when i feel that way
i usually call my mom
to tell her
how much i love her
yeah
and shes always
are you okay
do you have cancer
laughs
are you gonna commit suicide
its almost
not worth it
so uh
so what about us
what about us
look i
what i mean is
um
if we were both
going to die tonight
what like
if the apocalypse was coming
no no
thats too dramatic
but what if you know
just the two of us
were going to die
i mean
hmmm
would we talk
about your book
the environment or
if today
was our last day
yeah what would
we talk about
what would you tell me
for example
well
thats hard huh
no well
no ill do it
i definitely would stop
talking about my book
okay
i have to admit
i would probably
drop the environment
okay
but i would still ih6twant to
talk about you know
the magic in the universe
mmhmm
id just want to
do it from a
what
a hotel room you know
in between sessions of us
wildly fucking until we die
wow
well why waste time
with an hotel room
why not do it
right there on a bench
okay come on
no
come here
come here come here
no
laughs
okay
were not gonna
die tonight
all right too bad
okay
yeah
im sorry
that was
an extreme example
i was okay
im sorry
what i
my point was you know
to truly communicate
with people
is very hard to do
no i know i mean
most of our
most of our daytoday
exchanges
yeah i know i mean
not to bring everything
back to sex but
but why not
no no
this example
this friend of mine
she was talking about
she and her boyfriend
problems in bed
right
and how when they had
been dating for a year
she started telling him
what he could do
to please her more
and it totally freaked him out
why
totally
well he felt all threatened
and he thought it meant
he was a bad lover
maybe she shouldnt have
waited so long
after a year
well yeah
but men are
so easily offended
oh what more than women
you think
oh definitely
on that subject
you think so
yeah yeah yeah yeah
hmm
well maybe its because
you know
men are easier to
you know
to please
to please
well i dont know
yeah
yeah they are
they definitely
definitely
anyway this friend of mine
she was telling me
that um next time
she dates another man
shes gonna make
a little questionnaire
about what they like
and dislike before they
what like written down
or out loud
yeah yeah written down
mostly written down
but it wouldnt be
just you know yes or no
it would be a bit more
complex than that
like what
for example if the question is
are you into s and m
uh the answer could be
no but
a good spanking
once in a while doesnt hurt
right
right or like what
do you
so do you like
talking dirty in bed
that kind of thing
yeah yeah yeah but not
just like any dirty talk
mmhmm
just like what specific word
would you like to hear
you know
right what me
well yeah
like for example like
what specific word
would you like to hear
i dont know
um
what do you feel
about the word pussy
ilove it
good
laughs
its azing
what perverts weve become
i know i know
in the past nine years
well at least now
we dont have to pretend
that each new sexual experience
is like a lifealtering event
i know by now i know
youve stuck it
in so many places
its like
about to fall off right
mmm yeah you know
i cant realistically expect
uve become
anything but a total ho
at this point you know
yeah thank you
laughs

what can you do
hmm what can you do

that was lying down
a bomb
a bum
a bum
a homeless
laughs

like he needed help

was to photograph him
he went like
really close to his face
fixing his collar

he was like totally detached
from the person
yeah but dont you kind of
have to be like that

and you have my bags
right
yeah so well
be there in
i dont know
its the next stop
okay au revoir
okay
yeah yeah
oh wow
notre dame man
check that out
oh wow
i heard this story once
about when the germans
were occupying paris
and they had
to retreat back
they wired
notre dame to blow
but they had to
they had to leave one guy
in charge
of hitting the switch
and the guy
the soldier he
he couldnt do it
you know he just
sat there knocked out
by how beautiful
the place was
and then when
the allied troops came in
they found all the explosives
just lying there
and the switch unturned
and they found
the same thing
at the sacrécoeur
eiffel tower
a couple other places
i think
is that true
i dont know
i always liked
the story though
yeah thats
a great story
but you have to think
that notre dame will
be gone one day
there used to
be another church
or cathedral at the seine
right there
what right in the same spot
yeah
hmm
yeah this is great
ive never done this
yeah
i forget about
how beautiful paris is
this isnt so bad
being a tourist huh
thank you for getting me
on the boat
oh youre welcome
you know i think
that book that i wrote
in a way was like
building something
so that
i wouldnt forget
the details of the time
that we spent together
you know like
just as a reminder that
that once we really did meet
you know that this was real
this happened
im happy youre saying that
because
i mean i always feel
like a freak
because im never able
to move on like this
you know
people just
have an affair
or even
entire relationships
they break up
and they forget
they move on like they wouldve
changed brand of cereals
i feel i was never able
to forget anyone ive been with
because each person had
their own
specific qualities
you can never
replace anyone
what is lost is lost
each relationship
when it ends really damages me
i never fully recover
thats why im very careful with
getting involved because
it hurts too much
even getting laid
laughs
i actually dont do that because
i will miss of the person
the most mundane things
like im obsessed
with little things
maybe im crazy
butwhen i was a little girl
my mom told me that i was
always late to school
one day she followed me
to see why
i was looking at chestnuts
falling from the trees
rolling on the sidewalk
or ants crossing the road
the way a leaf cast a shadow
on a tree trunk
little things
i think its
the same with people
i see in them
little details
so specific
to each of them
that move me
and that i miss
and will always miss
you can never replace anyone
because everyone is made of such
beautiful specific details
like i remember the way
your beard has
a bit of red in it
and how the sun was
making it glow that
that morning
right before you left
i remembered that
and i missed it
really crazy right
all right
now i know for sure
you wanna know why
i wrote that stupid book
why
so that you might
come to a reading
in paris
and i could walk up to you
and ask
where the fuck were you
chuckles
no you think
id be here today
im serious
i think i
i wrote it in a way
to try to find you
okay thats
i know thats not true
but thats sweet of you
to say
well i think
it is true
what do you think
the chances were
of us ever meeting again
after that december
id say almost zero
but were not real anyway
right
were just characters
in that old ladys dream
shes on her deathbed
fantasizing about her youth
so of course
we had to meet again
groans
oh god
why werent you there in vienna
i told you why
yeah i know why
i just
i wish you would have been
our lives might have been
so much different
quietly you know
do you think so
i actually do
maybe not
maybe we would have
hated each other eventually
oh what like we hate
each other now
you know
maybe were
were only good
at brief encounters
walking around
in european cities
in warm climate
chuckles
oh god why didnt we exchange
phone numbers and stuff
why didnt we do that
because we were
young and stupid
do you think we still are
i guess when youre young
you just believe
there will be many people
with whom youll connect with
and later in life you realize
it only happens a few times
yeah and you can
screw it up
you know misconnect
well the past
is the past
it was meant
to be that way
what you really
believe that
that everythings fated
wellyou know
the world might be
less free than we think
yeah
yeah when given
these exact circumstances
thats what will
happen every time
two part hydrogen
one part oxygen
youll get water
every time
no no no i mean
what if your grandmother had
lived a week longer you know
or passed away a week earlier
days even you know
things mightve been different
i believe that
no you cant think
like that its
no i mean i know you shouldnt
on most things but
its just it
on this one it seemed like
something was off you know
i mean
in the months leading up
to my wedding okay
i was thinking abo
i mean
even on my way there
im in the car
and a buddy of mine
is driving me downtown
and im staring
out the window
and i think i see you
not far from
the church right
folding up an umbrella
and walking into a deli
on the corner
of 13th and broadway
and i thought i was
going crazy you know
but now i think
it probably was you
i lived on
11th and broadway
softly
you see
inhales
sowhat is it like
to be married
you havent talked much
about that
i havent
how weird
i dont know
we met
you know
when i was in college
and uh we broke up
and got back together
for a period of years
and then um
what we were
sort of back together
and she was pregnant
so marriage
what is she like
shes a great teacher
a good mom
uh shes smart pretty
you know
i remember thinking
at the time
thatso many of the men
that i admired most you know
that their lives were
were dedicated to something
greater than themselves
so you got married
because men you admired
were married
no no no it
its more like i had this idea
of my best self you know
and i wanted
to pursue that
even if it mightve been
overriding my honest self
do you know
what im saying
i mean
its funny like
in the moment
i remember thinking
that it didnt much matter
the who of it all
i mean that nobody
is gonna be everything to you
and that ultimately
its just the simple action of
committing yourself you know
meeting your responsibilities
that matters
i mean
what is love right
if its not respect
trust admiration
and i i felt
all those things
so cut to
the present tense
and i feel like
im running a small nursery
with somebody
i used to da you know
i mean im like a monk
you know
i mean ive had sex
less than
10 times
in the last four years
laughs
what what what
you laughing at me
no
it sounds pathetic
what monastery do the monk
have sex 10 times
okay youre right
laughs
im doing better
than most monks all right
but i do i feel like
if somebody were to touch me
you know i would dissolve
into molecules
well were here
weve gotta go
come on
shit
speaking french
bonsoir
bonsoir
bonsoir
oh sacrécoeur
im sorry to hear that
what
you know youre not that
happy with your marriage
well this friend of mine
shes a shrink and
yeah hows she doing
shes a mess but
both laugh
no she was telling me
that shes been dealing
with a lot of couples
that are breaking up
for the same exact reason
mmm what reason
is that
well all
those couples expected
after a few years
of living together
for the passion that consuming
desire to be the same
than in the beginning
yeah right
its impossible
no i know that
and thank god
otherwise we would end up
with aneurysms if we were
in that constant state
of excitement right
we would end up doing nothing
at all with our lives
do you think you would
have finished your book
if you were fucking
someone every five minutes
i might have
welcomed the challenge
no
both laugh
but you know
its natural for your wife
after the birth of your son
no
she has to giveall her love
to the little one
of course
imagine if she was
totally obsessed with sex
riding you
like a wild cat
that wouldnt make
any sense right
no no it wo
everything youre
saying makes sense
its
its not about sex
no i know
its obvious
i um
you know couples
are so confused lately
i think
it must be that
men need to feel essential
and they dont anymore
because its been
imprinted in their head
for so many years
that they have
to be the provider
like i im a strong
independent woman
in my professional life
really
i dont need a man
to feed me
but i still need a man
to love me
and that i could love
you know
so uh
your drivers here
yeah
well i guess
this is goodbye
you better give me your
no why dont we just
give you a ride home
wherever youre going huh
well i can take
the métro im fine
no no no no no
my flights
not until 1000 right
theyve got me arriving
two hours early
its not really
this way we can keep talking
no no monsieur
its not really on the way
can
speaks french
oui
speaks french
both speaking french
so you told him where you are
and all that jazz
yeah
celine speaks french
engine starts
so he knows where hes going
yes
glad somebody does
chuckles
no but this is better
than the métro right
definitely
i was thinking
for me its better
i dont romanticize things
as much anymore
i was suffering so much
all the time
i still have
lots of dreams
but theyre not in regard
to my love life
it doet make me sad
its just the way it is
is that why youre in
a relationship
with somebody
whos never around
chuckles
yes obviously i cant deal
with the daytoday life
of a relationship
yeah we have you know
this exciting time together
and then he leaves
and i miss him
but at least
im not dying inside
when someone
is always around me
im like suffocating
no wait you just said that
you need to love and be loved
yeah but when i do it
quickly makes me nauseous
laughs
its a disaster
i mean im really happy
only when im on my own
even being alone
its better than
sitting next to a lover
and feeling lonely
its not so easy
for me
to be a romantic
you start off that way
and after youve been
screwed over a few times
you you forget about
all your delusional ideas
and you just take
what comes into your life
thats not even true
i havent been
screwed over
ive just had too many
blah relationship
they werent mean
they cared for me
but there were no real
connection or excitement
at least
not from my side
god im sorry is it
is it really that bad
its not right
you know
its not even that
i was i was fine
until i read your fucking book
it stirred shit up
you know
it reminded me
how genuinely romantic i was
how i had so much hope
in things
and now its like
i dont believe in anything
that relates to love
i dont feel things
for people anymore
in a way
i put all my romanticism
into that one night
and i was never able
to feel all this again
hey
like somehow this night
took things away from me
and i exprsed them to you
and you took them with you
it made me feel cold
like if love wasnt for me
no no
i dont believe that
sighs
i dont believe that
you know what
reality and love
are almost contradictory for me
its funny
every single of my exes
theyre now married
men go out with me
we break up
and then they get married
chuckles
and later they call me
to thank me
for teaching them what love is
oh god
and that i taught them
to care and respect women
yeah i think im
one of those guys
you know
i want to kill them
why didnt they ask me
to marry them
i would have said no but
at least they couldve asked
but its my fault
i know its my fault
because i never felt
it was the right man
never
but what does it mean
the right man the love of your
life the concept is absurd
the idea that we can only be
complete with another person
is evil right
can i talk
you know
i guess ive been
heartbroken
too many times
and then i recovered
so now you know
from the starts
i make no effort
because i know
its not gonna work out
you cant you cant do that
you cant live your life
trying to avoid pain
at the expense
okay you know what
those are words
ive gotta get away from you
stop the car
i wanna get out
no dont
no its
dont get out
you know what
keep talking
its being around you
no dont touch me
okay
i wanna get a cab
speaks french
monsieur monsieur
no no no just
dont keep going
keep
hey no listen
im just so happy
sighs
thank you
just keep going
all right
sighs
look i am just so happy
all right to be with you
i am im so glad
you didnt forget about me
okay
no i didnt
and it pisses me off
okay
you come here to paris
all romantic and married okay
screw you
dont get me wrong
im not trying
to get you or anything
i mean all i need
is a married man
and theres been so much
water under the bridge
its not even about you anymore
its about that time
that moment in time
that is forever gone
i dont know
you say all that
but you didnt even
remember having sex so
of course i remembered
you did
yes
women pretend things
like that i dont know
they do
yeah what was i
supposed to say
that i remember
the wine in the park
and us looking up
at the stars fading away
as the sun came up
we had sex twice
you idiot
chuckles
chuckles
all right
you know what
im just happy to see you
even if youve become
an angry manicdepressive
activist i still like you
giggles
i still enjoy being around you
and i feel the same
im sorry i dont know
what happened
i just i had to
let it all out
ah dont worry about it
im so miserable
in my love life
exhales
in my relationship
i always act as like
you know im detached
but im dying inside
im dying because
im so numb
i dont feel pain
or excitement
im not even bitter
im just
you think youre
the one dying inside
my life is 247 bad
giggles
im sorry
no no
i mean
the only happiness i get
is when im out
with my son
ive been
to marriage counseling
ive done things
i never thought
i would have to do
ive lit candles
bought selfhelp books
lingerie
did the candles help
hell no all right
i dont love her the way
she needs to be loved
and i dont even
see a future for us
but then i look
at my little boy
sitting at the table
across from me
and i think i would suffer
any torture to be with him
for all the minutes
of his life you know
dont want to
miss out on one
but then ththeres no joy
or laughter in my home
you know
and i dont want him
growing up in that
ah no laughter
thats terrible
my parents have been
together for 35 years
and even when
they have a bad fight
they end up
laughing like crazy
yeah i just i dont want
to be one of those people
who are getting
divorced at 52
and falling down
into tears
admitting that they never
really loved their spouse
and they feel their life
has been
sucked up into
a vacuum cleaner
you know i want a great life
i want her to have a great life
she deserves that
all right
but were just living
in the pretense of a marriage
responsibility you know
all these just
ideas of how people
are supposed to live
but then i
i have these dreams
what dreams
i have these dreams
you know that um
im standing on a platform
and uh
what
you keep going by
on a train
and
you go by
and you go by
and you go by
you go by
and i wake up with
the fucking sweats you know
and then i have
this other dream
ohhhh where youre pregnant
in bed beside me naked
and i want so badly
to touch you
but you tell me not to
and then
you look away and
and i
i touch you anyway
right on your ankle
and your skin is so soft
that i wake up in sobs
all right
sighs
and my wife is sitting there
looking at me
and i feel like
im a million miles from her
and i know that
theres something wrong
you know that i
groans
god that i cant keep living
like this that theres gotta be
something more to love
than commitment
but then i think
that i mightve given up
on the whole idea
of romantic love
that i i might have
put it to bed that
that day when
you werent there
you know i think
i mightve done that
why are you telling me
all this
im sorry
i dont know
i i shouldnt have
i shouldnt have
you know its so weird
people think
they are
the only ones
going through
tough times
i mean when i read
