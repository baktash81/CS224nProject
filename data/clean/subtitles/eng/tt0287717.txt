the president s daughter 
big smile  big smile 
hello  alexandra 
where s your father 
he ll be here 
i ll make sure of it 
well  hey there 
little miss first lady 
i m dinky winks  owner
of this fine establishment 
you ready to ride the ride
and shrill to the thrills 
spills  and chills 
yes  i am 
right this way 
of course  that behind me   
the world famous whippersnapper 
  guaranteed to make
grown men howl
  like a cub woke
at weaning time 
over on our left   
the nervewracker   
oh ho  painful 
good fun 
on your other left
is  well 
my personal favorite
the vomiter 
now  we tell people
not to ride it
on a full stomach 
but you know folks 
they just don t listen 
but   
why bother with any
of those 
you re here
for my latest and greatest 
for your personal amusement
and complete gratification 
i humbly offer   
the juggler 
but is it fast 
is it fast 
well  let s see  shall we 
the riders are strapped
into the bubble 
the hydrobot lifts the bubble
high into the air 
and spins it round and round
as fast
as the united states government
will allow 
the bubble spins  turns 
flips  and bounces 
and then    it juggles you 
i want to go on 
i thought so 
now  understand   the override
precautions are top notch 
modified by yours truly 
i thought her father
was supposed to be here 
the president
has more pressing business
than to spend
an entire sunday
in a theme park 
no one s that busy 
have fun  kid 
  we ll take it a little slow 
just make it fun 
can t you get her down 
somebody s jammed
the override 
why  that
little troublemaker 
remain calm 
remain calm 
we are the secret service 
everything is under control 
  there s nothing
we can do  sir 
  what 
the weight of our agents
will prevent us from ascending
the shaky precipice
on which she now stands 
she ll fall 
don t we have
any smaller agents 
bring me agents sk1 and sk2 
  coming through 
  coming through 
we re ready 
use this   the latest gear 
we get to keep them
afterwards 
  n no 
yes 
of course 
let s rock 
you re sure
they can handle this 
if not 
there are two others who can 
bring me agents sk3 and sk4
as backup 
we got company 
gary and gerti

now you done it 
over here 
get away from me 
alexandra  take my hand 
back off 
i want my father
to come up here and get me 
but he s the president
of the united states 
no  he s my father 
he was my father
before he ever became president 
and he should still
be my father now 
i want him up here 
sir  we have a situation 
she s got the transmooker 
this is now
a code red situation 
get her down now 
the point is 
you and your father
need to have a talk 
up here may not be
the best place 
come with me 
and i promise you 
  the two of you will have
that talk 
how can you promise that 
i m level 2 
i can order him
to talk to you 
hi  gerti 
whatcha doing 
i m trying to stop the ride 
  without disengaging
the axis 
  exactly 
then stop what you re doing

is designed to work
like a giant magnet 
if you reverse
the polarization 
bye bye

my father s office this morning

that we ve learned so much 
juni and i are more
than capable of taking
bigger assignments 
but that s not
your decision to make 
the spy kids organization
is still new 
and if you re a level 3
or even a level 2 
you cannot
go on a mission alone 
you need more experience 
come on

it s bunching up
around your gut 
and it makes your head
look way too big 
you have to excuse
my little brother

controls his temper 
just be glad

and their newly formed
spy kids division 
for their outstanding
accomplishments yesterday 
gary and gerti giggles
not only saved
my daughter   
what is he talking about 
i saved her 
juni   
but more importantly 
if not most importantly 
they safely retrieved
the transmooker device
that my daughter accidentally
took from my office
earlier that day 
now it is my great pleasure
to announce
the new director
of the o s s   
gregor
    donnagon giggles 
gary and gerti giggles
are the kind of agents
we need
to turn the o s s  around 
i am proud to award them
  these level 1 badges 
  what 
  which will enable them
to take on real missions 
something challenging 
like the ukata assignment 
yes 
  i wanted that assignment 
this is so unfair 
i am proud to claim them
as our organization s
top spy kid operatives 
something s not right 
and i m also proud
to claim them  of course 
as my children 
this is all wrong 
to our spy kids 
  to our spy kids 
  to our spy kids 
  to our spy kids 
to our spy kids 
this   
secure the perimeter 
sleepers

  it s my turn  too 
  are you sure

hold on a second 
i had the transmooker
in my hand 
but you know juni
he wanted to claim it
for himself 
  okay  that should do it 
thank you  son 
  right 
if that transmooker device
falls into the wrong hands   
we re doomed 
thank you  mr  president 
that ll be all 
we re doomed 
understood  sir 
here 
 floop s fooglie    
starring minion   
and carmenita   
thanks 
i was fired 
i know 
i hacked
into the o s s  data files
and saw the news 
it was probably my fault 
i suppose 
i m sorry 
well  i guess that s that 
let s go to the tree house 
i got an idea 
i guess
i could always set up
a small detective agency
out here or something 
you re thinking
small again  juni 
the old tree house
needs another helicopter pad 
it needs a paint job 
is what it needs 
your name 
carmen elizabeth juanita
echo sky brava cortez 
  your name 
juni rocket racer
rebelde cortez 
you know   
i m kind of looking forward
to retirement 
get back to all the projects
and dreams i left behind 
oh  stop it  juni 
look  do you want
your job back or not 
that s right   
reinstated level 2 
so now we can get back
the missing transmooker 
how 
looks like gary and gerti
are about to get briefed
on the ukata assignment 
we should listen in 
is r a l p h  still
at your office 
if they haven t
cleaned it out yet 
r a l p h  
get to the briefing room 
we need you to spy
on gary and gerti 
make sure no one sees you 
  there is
a bermuda triangle of sorts
off the coast
of madagascar 
as you may remember 
this is an area
where some of our o s s  cargo
ships have been disappearing 
good boy  r a l p h 
the survivors
of these disappearances
tell delusional tales
of a mysterious island
populated by strange creatures 
obviously  no land mass
is located anywhere near there 
  so these tales were
dismissed  and the agents fired 
however   
the magnet ship that captured
the transmooker device
was last seen
in this same area 
so  we need a small ship 
piloted by two small agents
to go in and take
a closer look 
if you find anything
out of the ordinary 
you return 
you report it back here 
  we accept 
  we accept 
you bet we accept 
come home  r a l p h 
good work 
it s a great assignment 
but gary and gerti have it 
and i m fired 
and i m reassigning you
to the o s s 
  don t tell me
you re hacking into
  already done 
level 2 status
reinstated 
carmen  you can t do this 
i already did it 
i d take it one step further 
we re assigning ourselves
to the ukata assignment 
i m programming a new
destination for gary and gerti

the transmooker device back

ukata   
transmooker   
  the president s
daughter is unavailable

press  1  to record 
  mean anything to you 
smells like the work
of donnagon giggles 
he had first contact
with the transmooker technology 
you think donnagon s the one
behind all this 
you re talking
to a man with four heads 
trust me   
the guy is dirt 
what should we look for 
first  find the island 
then find the island man 
that would have been
donnagon s contact 
okay 
thanks  minion 
be a good girl
and swat your brother for me 
oh  i will 
something s wrong 
take the wheel 
got to go 
good luck 
slow down  we re nearing

rebreathers

here we go 
should we travel light
or heavy 
we may not be coming
back down here 
let s go heavy 
inflate a suits 
we don t have much choice 
at least the masks work 
i think it s because
they re valve operated 
not electrical based 
it s so strange 
good luck 
you too 
stay close 
ugh  great 
i m fat 
was it supposed to do this 
it has an electrical
automatic shutoff
which didn t work 
luckily  we ran out of air
before the suits exploded 
well  we can still laugh 
at what 
at whatever you can imagine
gary and gerti are doing
right about now 
gerti  where are we 
well

to my coordinates 
  we are   
i think that
camel poop 
someone s gonna pay 
cordezes

that was the one mission
we never accomplished 
ingrid

you should mention them 
no  when i mention your
parents  it is the exact
opposite of funny 
  doesn t it bother
you that we never got
their full blessing

chance to show them
  all right  all right

but i won t be here

  greg  lngrid 
you guys risked your lives
once before to save me 
let me go now
and personally bring
your children back

thank you  donnagon 
but  respectfully 
we have to do this ourselves 
  if you could provide
tactical backup
and surveillance support
of our efforts 
we ll leave immediately 
okay  yeah 
uh  lngrid   
i know this may be
a bad time  but  um   
your parents are here

were working 
gary would be brave enough
to do it

back up there 
uh  okay 
i m gonna grab your hand 
okay 
my cellphone 
why d you stop 
  something wrong 
close your eyes 
why 
juni 
what 
i m sorry 
how long
have we been falling 
i don t know 
my watch doesn t tell time 
best guess 
i d say about three hours 
feels like four 
how could you be eating
at a time like this 
you know that tickling sensation
you get when you fall 
of course 
that pretty much went away
after the first hour 
what happened 
i don t know 
we re floating 
who are you 
  do you see something 
  over there  hiding 
what do you want 
i want to get down 
i m carmen cortez 
special agent of the o s s 
i m romero 
sole inhabitant
of this island of leeke leeke   
    sole human inhabitant 
that is 
and you are 
tired and hungry 
nice to meet you 
tired and hungry 
  careful  you ll crush my island 
sorry 
we just fell four hours 
we re a little clumsy right now 
you weren t falling 
it was an illusion 
magic 
science 
quickly 
we must get somewhere safe 
i m a genetic specialist 
i needed a controlled
environment for my experiments 
the creatures
we ve been hearing 
my experiments   
run amok 
what happened 
i thought i would make
a fortune from it 
kids everywhere would have
their own miniature zoos 
  right there
in their bedrooms 
a miniature zoo 
god s creatures   
on a manageable scale 
unbelievable 
i called it
 romero s zoo    
  genetically miniaturized
animals 
lions  tigers  bears 
penguins   
monkeys 
monkeys in a barrel 
careful 
careful 
one day 
i accidentally mixed up
two or three
different test tubes
and created
a new species    altogether 
romero s zoo too   
an entirely new   
miniature zoo   
  where each species
is unlike
any creature
you ve ever seen 
horse fly 
uh    cat fish 
spider monkey 
bull frog 
uh   
slizzards 
  whoa 
  stay away from those 
  and so  i started to think 
   lf only i could make
them all a wee bit bigger  
you know  for kids
with meatier hands 
that s where things went
very wrong 
i applied a growth serum 
and they took to it
all too well 
n n no 
no 
and i ve been locked up
in here ever since 
i m afraid to go
out there again 
they ve tried to gobble me up
on more than one occasion 
why do they despise me so 
i created them 
do you think   
god stays in heaven
because he  too 
lives in fear
of what he s created   
here on earth 
stop looking at me like that 
i m no loon 
what i m still trying
to figure out
is why this island
doesn t show up
on even
our most advanced satellites 
i created a cloaking
device to shield my island
from curious eyes 
anything electronically
powered that comes
within a mile radius
instantly shuts down 
any radar that passes
over me is displaced 
creating the illusion
that my island doesn t exist 
the transmooker device 
how did you know 
your cloaking device
is highly coveted 
people everywhere are trying
to get their hands on it 
are you sure
we re the only humans here 
there they are
two children 
judging by their size 
what is this 
it s a miniature
of the island 
the center point of
the volcano provides
a gravitational basis
for which
my miniature creatures
can line up exactly
to their larger
clone counterparts 
  so  wherever your miniature
creatures are on this model 
it s where the bigger ones
are outside 
correct  i can keep track
of their whereabouts this way 
  see 
the two intruder children are
being chased by a slizzard 
  gary and gerti 
  leave em 
we have to go help them 
they shouldn t be
snooping around my
island to begin with 
  i m with you  dude 
  we have to help them 
i m not going out there 
i ll be eaten 
what a bizarre man 
  help us 
  help 
somebody 
what are you guys doing
down there 
that s real funny  clown 
get us out 
we tried to activate
our micrograpplers 
but they didn t deploy 
nothing works here 
yeah  we know that now 
thanks for the update 
carrot top 
  juni  come back 
they need our help 
  i ll help them 
i want to get him
back over here
so i can push him
back over myself 
  hurry up 
  come on 
here  gary 
gimme your hand 
thank you  carmen 
here  gerti   
gimme your hand 
just wait
till my father gets here 
your father s coming 
where are you
taking me now  carmen 
hold on 
why are you still hiding 
we re kids  not monsters 
what s the difference 
relax 
they re o s s  agents  as well 
  level one 
  they re donnagon s kids 
agent donnagon 
you work for the o s s  
don t you 
i work
for a man named donnagon 
who is this guy 
  donnagon s not interested
in your creatures 
  why not 
the transmooker device
that hides your island
that s what donnagon
really wants 
that s not nearly
as interesting 
now that donnagon s head
of the o s s  
he has the power
to take it from you 
what are you babbling
about now  juni 
the transmooker you took
from the president s
daughter  gary 
it was just a prototype 
the real transmooker device
is here on this island 
it s even more powerful
and can shut down
all technology on the planet 
you said
your father s on his way 
i think he s coming
to pick it up 
you re all liars 
do you really think you re
gonna turn us on our own father 
did your dad tell you
the mission you went on
was just a setup
for carmen and me 
  why not 
  he has his reasons 
that s what being a good spy
is all about
trust no one 
how to be a spy   
we ve read it 
well  read it again 
a good spy makes
no binding connections
with family or friends 
well  i don t believe
in that   do you 
if you want to be a good spy 
you better believe it 
my father s a great spy 
so let s grow up  shall we 
whatever my father s done 
it s what it takes to play
in the big world   
iike it or not 
come on  gerti 
let s go 
he s right 
oh  why can t you side with me
just once 
there are no sides   
you re right 
and he s right  too 
that s what
being a spy means 
well  i don t like it 
  then quit 
  i will 
yeah  right 
  donnagon was right   
  their dragonspy doesn t
show up anywhere on radar 
i am not interested
in finding the sub 
remember that year
i insisted on doing the
children s dental work    myself 
how could i forget 
well   
i installed
a nonelectrical tracking device
in their teeth
my own invention 
but i haven t been able
to test it 
until   
now 
  honey  it works 
  whoa   
hard to believe 
but according to this   
they re in
the middle of the ocean 
above sea level 
but where they are on the map 
there s no land mass 
  how can that be 
now what 
something s got us 
  aaah 
  what is it 
your mother 
  mom 
  we wanted to join you 
are you nuts 
we needed a bigger boat 
and we brought real food
none of that freeze dried stuff
you think s so chic 
  son in law 
  yeah 
make yourself useful 
why are you here 
we wanted to help
get our grandchildren back 
we will get
our grandchildren back 
gracias 
oh  wait 
  you ve got something
on your lip 
  what 
  got it 
uh  mom   
dad  i am a big girl now 
and i can take care
of myself  okay 
and gregorio and l 
we can take care of
finding our children 
no  you don t seem
to understand 
this isn t you and gregorio
simply saving the world again 
this time  we all have much more
to lose if you fail
carmen and juni 
you cannot come with us 
it is too dangerous 
oh  you mean 
we can t handle ourselves 
may i have
my moustache back   
please 
if donnagon really is
on his way   
    we have to destroy
the transmooker 
where is it 
the other side of the island 
not easy to get to 
the journey alone
is more dangerous than
the transmooker itself 
  i made sure of it 
show us 
you re not going out there 
are you 
we don t have much choice 
do we 
with those monsters
running around 
i don t believe
they re monsters 
maybe you shouldn t  either 
  well  what should i believe 
  i don t know 
you re always in here hiding 
maybe they
just wanna be with you 
be with me 
they wanna be picking me
out of their teeth 
is what they wanna be 
you just gotta show them
who s boss 
you re not afraid 
first thing
you gotta do is   
    fall into this pit 
how does it work 
supposedly 
they re run magnetically 
we should be able to ride over
a determined path 
we have to get the transmooker
before they do 
right 
slizzards 
oh  no 
this is cool 
juni 
juni 
  i think we should
get off now 
why 
trust me 
jump now 
gary and gerti 
i told you
they were following us 
you have one new message 
message one   
hello  alexandra 
it s me
agent juni cortez 
i m on a mission   
i know i shouldn t be 
but i had an idea
for you and your father 
simply tell him
you need to talk to him 
tell him it s nothing urgent 
but someday
it might be urgent 
and you need to open the
communication lines right now 
so give me a call 
love to hear from you 
and right now it s about
silly me  i forgot my watch
doesn t tell time 
heh 
and  uh
something s wrong 
take the wheel 
gotta go  good luck 
  juni 
  computer  end of message 
  gregorio  the signal requires
that you go around it 
  he won t listen to you 
  he won t listen to you 
mother 
  choose another directi
  he wants to make sure
he loses the children again 
if you would only listen to us
and do what we re saying
you re tracking them
all wrong 
ingrid  tell him
he s tracking them all wrong 
mom  dad 
i have told you before 
and i will tell you again   
no backseat driving 
  thank you 
  when gregorio is at the wheel 
no one tells him what to do 
turn here  honey 
sorry 
okay 
  you re sure you re
reading that map correctly 
the coordinates correspond
to carmen and juni s
current position 
these are my children 
and i will find them my way 
blah  blah  blah 
i never understand
a single word he s saying 
never 
not only were we set up 
but i bet donnagon
knew all along
that you d hack your way
into taking this assignment 
i was wondering
the same thing 
juni  open up 
what 
  dad installed these trackers
in case we ever got lost 
hurry  take mine out 
and why are we doing this 
when we get lost 
who saves us 
mom and dad 
now  if mom and dad
also disappear 
who s gonna stop donnagon from
using the transmooker device 
donnagon wants us
all together
so he can destroy the island
and all of us with it 
mom and dad   even romero 
we can t let mom and dad
find us   
or donnagon wins 
  a big sacrifice 
family is sacrifice 
what happened 
what did   
what did you just do 
we lost carmen 
  a and juni 
juni s still on line 
i love you 
that can t be 
  okay  okay 
what do we do 
i don t know 
maybe this is like
the mission of the spies
who didn t want to be found 
you know   
if they
don t want to be found 
maybe their position
is compromised 
now  gregorio  don t tell me
you didn t have a backup plan 
ingrid  was juni wearing
that charm necklace
i sent him for christmas
last year 
he never takes it off 
then we got him 
i was worried about
juni s well being 
so i put a tracer
in his necklace 
there he is 
thanks  dad 
are you sure you don t want me
to take over the wheel 
i   that s funny 
  it s funny 
back to work 
where are we 
well   
not far from
the antechamber 
i think it s behind us 
don t move 
maybe it s friendly 
maybe it s not 
let s go 
it s an underwater cave 
we ll have to go
all the way around 
that ll take all day 
there must be a faster
wow   
what is this place 
do you think
that s real gold 
gross 
this is so slimy 
i hate mold 
i can hear your thoughts 
what 
and you can hear mine 
our mouths aren t moving 
but we can hear
what we re thinking 
say something 
how strange 
we can only communicate
by thought 
  magic 
think something 
um    your feet stink 
i wonder 
okay  this place
is really weird 
let s go 
good thinking 
now  this is more like it 
treasure 
skeletons 
dead skeletons 
is there any other kind 
this must ve been where
the pirate prisoners
and treasure were kept 
this must ve been
a pretty special necklace
for them to die
fighting over it 
one necklace
to rule them all
put it back  juni 
i didn t take it yet 
i can read your mind 
remember 
this land
is ancient and cursed 
if you take anything 
you ll doom us both
