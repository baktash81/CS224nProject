mr perry read opening paragraph preface
entitled understanding poetry
understand poetry dr j evans pritchard phd
fully understand poetry must first fluent
metre rhyme figures speech
ask two questions
one artfully objective poem rendered
two important objective
question one rates poems perfection
question two rates importance
questions answered
determining poems greatness becomes relatively simple matter
poems score perfection plotted
horizontal graph
importance plotted vertical
calculating total area poem
yields measure greatness
sonnet byron might score high vertical
average horizontal
shakespearean sonnet hand
would score high horizontally vertically
yielding massive total area
thereby revealing poem truly great
proceed poetry book practise rating method
ability evaluate poems manner grows
enjoyment understanding poetry
excrement
