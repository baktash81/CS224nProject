    murmuring  chattering  
     continues  
  o captain  my captain   
who knows
where that comes from 
anybody 
  coughing 
blowing nose  
not a clue 
it s from a poem by walt whitman
about mr abraham lincoln 
now in this class you can
either call me mr keating   
or  if you re slightly more daring 
  o captain  my captain   
  scattered snickering  
now  let me dispel a few rumours
so they don t fester into facts 
yes  i  too  attended hell ton
and survived 
and  no  at that time  i was not
the mental giant you see before you 
i was the intellectual equivalent
of a 98 pound weakling 
i would go to the beach  and people
would kick copies of byron in my face 
  chuckling  
now    mr pitts 
that s a rather
unfortunate name 
  mr pitts  where are you 
    boys snickering  
mr pitts  would you open
your hymnal to page 542 
read the first stanza
of the poem you find there 
  spaz coughs  
  to the virgins
to make much of time   
  keating  
yes  that s the one 
  somewhat appropriate  isn t it 
    boys chuckling  
  pitts  
  gather ye rosebuds while ye may 
  old time is still a flying 
and this same flower that smiles today 
tomorrow will be dying   
thank you  mr pitts 
  gather ye rosebuds while ye may   
the latin term for that sentiment
is   carpe diem    
now  who knows what that means 
carpe diem 
that s   seize the day   
  very good  mister  
  meeks 
meeks 
another unusual name 
seize the day 
  gather ye rosebuds while ye may   
why does the writer
use these lines 
  because he s in a hurry 
  no  ding 
thank you
for playing anyway 
because we are food
for worms  lads 
because  believe it or not 
each and every one of us in this room   
is one day going to stop breathing 
turn cold and die 
i would like you
to step forward over here   
and peruse some of the faces
from the past 
you ve walked past them
many times  i don t think
you ve really looked at them 
they re not that different
from you  are they 
same haircuts 
full of hormones 
just like you 
invincible  just like you feel 
the world is their oyster 
they believe they re destined for
great things  just like many of you 
their eyes are full of hope 
just like you 
did they wait
until it was too late   
to make from their lives even one iota
of what they were capable 
because  you see  gentlemen  these
boys are now fertilizing daffodils 
but if you listen
real close   
you can hear them whisper
their legacy to you 
go on  lean in 
listen 
do you hear it 
  keating whispering  
carpe 
hear it 
  whispering  
carpe 
  continues whispering  
carpe diem 
seize the day  boys 
make your lives
extraordinary 
  chattering  
  that was weird 
  but different 
spooky  if you ask me

  radio continues humming  
gentlemen  open your text
to page 2 1 of the introduction 
mr perry  will you read
the opening paragraph of the preface 
entitled
  understanding poetry   
   understand poetry 
by dr j  evans pritchard  ph d 
  to fully understand poetry 
we must first be fluent   
  with its metre  rhyme
and figures of speech 
  then ask two questions 
  one   how artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered 
 and  two   how important
is that objective 
  question one rates
the poem s perfection 
  question two rates
its importance 
 and once these questions
have been answered   
  determining a poem s greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter 
  if the poem s score
for perfection is plotted   
  on the horizontal
of a graph   
  and its importance
is plotted on the vertical 
  then calculating
the total area of the poem   
  yields the measure
of its greatness 
  a sonnet by byron might
score high on the vertical 
  but only average
on the horizontal 
 a shakespearean sonnet 
on the other hand 
  would score high both
horizontally and vertically 
 yielding
a massive total area  
  thereby revealing
the poem to be truly great 
 as you proceed through the poetry in
this book  practise this rating method 
 as your ability to evaluate
poems in this manner grows 
so will   so will your enjoyment
and understanding of poetry   
excrement 
that s what i think
of mr j  evans pritchard 
we re not laying pipe 
we re talking about poetry 
i mean  how can you describe poetry
like american bandstand 
  i like byron  i give him a 42 
but i can t dance to it   
now  i want you
to rip out that page 
go on 
rip out the entire page 
you heard me 
rip it out 
rip it out 
go on 
rip it out 
thank you  mr dalton 
gentlemen  tell you what 
don t just tear out that page 
tear out the entire introduction 
i want it gone  history  leave nothing 
rip it out  rip  be gone 
j  evans pritchard  ph d  
rip  shred  tear 
rip it out  i want to hear nothing
but ripping of mr pritchard 
  we ll perforate it  put it on a roll 
    boys chuckling  
it s not the bible 
you re not gonna go to hell for this 
    boys chuckling  
    mumbling  
go on  make a clean tear 
i want nothing left of it 
    boys chattering  
  we shouldn t be doing this 
rip  rip  rip 
  keating  
rip it out  rip 
  boys chattering 
pages ripping  
  boys laughing  
rip it  yeah  rip it out 
  muffled chattering  laughing  
    boy   rip it 
  what the hell is going on here 
  i don t hear enough rips 
  mr keating 
mr mcallister 
i m sorry  i  
i didn t know you were here 
  i am 
  ah  so you are 
excuse me 
  keating  
keep ripping  gentlemen 
this is a battle  a war 
and the casualties could be
your hearts and souls 
thank you  mr dalton 
armies of academics
going forward measuring poetry 
no  we will not
have that here 
no more
of mrj  evans pritchard 
now  my class  you will learn
to think for yourselves again 
you will learn
to savour words and language 
no matter what
anybody tells you 
words and ideas
can change the world 
i see that look
in mr pitts  eye   
like 1 9th century literature
has nothing to do   
with going to business school
or medical school 
right  maybe 
mr hopkins  you may agree
with him  thinking 
  yes  we should simply study
our mr pritchard   
  and learn our rhyme and metre
and go quietly about the business   
of achieving other ambitions   
i have a little secret for you 
huddle up 
huddle up 
we don t read and write
poetry because it s cute 
we read and write poetry because
we are members of the human race 
and the human race
is filled with passion 
medicine  law 
business  engineering 
these are noble pursuits
and necessary to sustain life 
but poetry 
beauty  romance  love  
these are what
we stay alive for 
to quote from whitman  
  o me  o life of the questions
of these recurring 
  of the endless trains
of the faithless 
  of cities filled
with the foolish 
  what good amid these 
o me  o life 
  answer 
that you are here 
  that life exists
and identity 
  that the powerful play
goes on 
and you may contribute
a verse   
  that the powerful play
goes on 
and you may contribute
a verse    
what will your verse be 
  all   for what we are
about to receive 
may the lord make us
truly grateful 
amen 
quite an interesting class
you gave today  mr keating 
  sorry if i shocked you  mr mcallister 
  there s no need to apologise 
it was very fascinating 
misguided though it was 
you think so 
you take a big risk by encouraging them
to become artists john 
when they realize that they re
not rembrandts  shakespeares or mozarts 
they ll hate you for it 
we re not talking artists  george 
we re talking freethinkers 
freethinkers at 1 7 
funny  i never pegged you
as a cynic 
not a cynic 
a realist 
  show me the heart unfettered
by foolish dreams 
and i ll show you
a happy man   
  but only in their dreams
can men be truly free 
 twas always thus 
and always thus will be

  chuckling  
hey  i found his senior
annual in the library

    chuckling   god 
  what was the dead poets society 
i doubt the present administration
would look too favourably upon that 
why 
what was it 
  gentlemen  can you keep a secret 
  sure 
the dead poets were dedicated
to sucking the marrow out of life 
that s a phrase from thoreau we d invoke
at the beginning of every meeting 
you see  we would gather
at the old indian cave   
and take turns reading from thoreau 
whitman  shelley   the biggies 
even some of our own verse 
and in the enchantment of the moment 
we d let poetry work its magic 
you mean it was a bunch of guys
sitting around  reading poetry 
no  mr overstreet 
it wasn t just guys 
we weren t a greek organization 
we were romantics 
we didn t just read poetry  we let it
drip from our tongues  like honey 
spirits soared  women swooned
and gods were created  gentlemen 
not a bad way
to spend an evening  eh 
hmm 
thank you  mr perry

it was a dark and rainy night 
and this old lady 
who had a passion
for jigsaw puzzles 
sat by herself in her house at her table
to complete a new jigsaw puzzle 
but as she pieced
the puzzle together 
she realized 
to her astonishment 
that the image that was formed
was her very own room 
and the figure
in the centre of the puzzle 
as she completed it 
was herself 
and with trembling hands 
she placed the last four pieces   
and stared in horror at the face
of a demented madman at the window 
the last thing that
this old lady ever heard   
  was the sound of breaking glass 
  no  she didn t 
    laughing  chattering  
  yes  this is true  this is true 
  i ve got one that s better than that 
    charlie laughs

married couple 
and they re driving through the forest
at night on a long trip

  last year 
  in a mean abode
in the shanking road 
  lived a man named
william bloat 
  now  he had a wife 
the plague of his life 
  who continually
got his goat 
  and one day at dawn 
with her nightshift on 
he slit
her bloody throat

   tis not too late
to seek a newer world 
  for my purpose holds
to sail beyond the sunset 
  and though we are not
now that strength   
  which in old days
moved earth and heaven 
  that which we are  we are 
  one equal temper
of heroic hearts   
  made weak by time and fate 
but strong in will   
  to strive  to seek  to find 
and not to yield   
  then i had religion 
then i had a vision

about shakespeare   
as someone who writes
something very interesting 
now  many of you have seen shakespeare
done very much like this 
  british accent  
  o  titus  bring your friend hither   
but if any of you have seen
mr marlon brando 
  imitating brando   you know
that shakespeare can be different 
  friends  romans  countrymen 
lend me your ears   
  boys laughing  
you can also imagine maybe
john wayne as macbeth going

  laughing  
  dogs  sir 
oh  not just now 
  i do enjoy a good dog

  you can have yourself
a three course meal from one dog 
  start with a canine croquette 
  go to your fido flambe
for main course 
 and for dessert 
a pekingese parfait 
and you can pick your teeth
with the little paw    
why do i stand up here 
 anybody 
  to feel taller 
  no  thank you for playing 
    rings bell  
    laughing  
  i stand upon my desk   
to remind myself that we must constantly
look at things in a different way 
see  the world looks
very different from up here 
you don t believe me 
come see for yourselves 
come on 
come on just when you
think you know something 
you have to look at it
in another way 
even though it may seem
silly or wrong 
you must try 
now when you read  don t just
consider what the author thinks 
  consider what you think 
    jumps down  
boys  you must strive
to find your own voice 
because the longer
you wait to begin 
the less likely you are
to find it at all 
thoreau said    most men lead
lives of quiet desperation   
don t be resigned to that 
break out 
don t just walk off the edge

maybe not  i don t know   
mr overstreet 
driven by a deeper force  yes 
we know that  all right  now  i didn t
bring them up here to ridicule them 
i brought them up here to
illustrate the point of conformity 
the difficulty in maintaining your
own beliefs in the face of others 
now  i see the look in your eyes like 
  i would have walked differently   
well  ask yourselves
why you were clapping 
now we all have a great need
for acceptance 
but you must trust that
your beliefs are unique  your own 
even though others may think
them odd or unpopular 
even though the herd may go 
  that s ba a a a ad   
    boys laughing  
    keating   robert frost said 
  two roads diverged in the wood and i 
i took the one less traveled by 
and that has made
all the difference   
i want you to find
your own walk right now 
your own way of striding 
pacing any direction 
anything you want  whether it s proud 
whether it s silly  anything 
  gentlemen  the courtyard is yours 
    boys murmuring  chuckling  
you don t have to perform 
just make it for yourself 
mr dalton 
will you be joining us 
exercising the right
not to walk

that s part of what this club is about

i d like to announce   
i published an article in the school
paper in the name of the dead poets 
  what 
  demanding girls
be admitted to welton   
  you didn t 
  so we can all stop beating off 
  how did you do that 
    charlie   i m one of the proofers 
  i slipped the article in 
  it s it s over now 
why 
nobody knows who we are 
well  don t you think
they re gonna figure out who wrote it 
they re gonna come to you and ask
to know what the dead poets society is 
charlie  you had no right
to do something like that 
it s nuwanda  cameron 
  gloria  
that s right  it s nuwanda 
are we just playing around out here 
or do we mean what we say 
if all we do is come together
and read a bunch of poems to each other 
  what the hell are we doing 
    neil   all right 
but you still shouldn t
have done it  charlie 
this could mean trouble 
you don t speak for the club 
hey  would you not worry about
your precious little neck 
if they catch me 
i ll tell them i made it up 
    whispering  
  fine 
sit 
in this week s issue
of welton honor 
there appeared a profane
and unauthorized article 
rather than spend my valuable time
ferreting out the guilty persons  
and let me assure you
i will find them  
i m asking any and all students
who know anything about this article   
to make themselves known
here and now 
whoever the guilty persons are 
this is your only chance to avoid
expulsion from this school 
  phone ringing 
teachers murmuring  
welton academy 
hello 
yes  he is 
just a moment 
mr nolan  it s for you 
it s god 
he says we should have girls
at welton 
  boys laughing  
wipe that smirk off your face 
if you think  mr dalton 
that you re the first to try to get
thrown out of this school  think again 
others have had similar notions and have
failed just as surely as you will fail 
  assume the position 
    sighs  
count aloud  mr dalton 
  paddle strikes  
one 
  strikes dalton  
two 
  strikes dalton  
three

  low murmuring  
    neil   you kicked out 
  no 
    neil   so what happened 
    sighs  
i m to turn everybody in 
apologise to the school 
and all will be forgiven 
so what are you gonna do 
  charlie  
  damn it  neil 
the name is nuwanda 
  door closes  
  both chuckling  
excuse me 
may we have a word  mr keating 
certainly 
this was my first classroom john 
did you know that 
my first desk 
i didn t know you taught 
mr nolan 
english 
long before your time 
it was hard giving it up 
i can tell you 
i m hearing rumours
about some unorthodox
teaching methods in your classroom 
i m not saying they ve had anything
to do with the dalton boy s outburst 
but i don t think i have to warn you
boys his age are very impressionable 
well  your reprimand made
quite an impression  i m sure 
  what was going on
in the courtyard the other day 
  courtyard 
  boys marching  clapping in unison 
  oh  that 
that was an exercise to prove a point 
dangers of conformity 
well john  the curriculum here is set 
it s proven  it works 
if you question it  what s to
prevent them from doing the same 
i always thought the idea of education
was to learn to think for yourself 
at these boys  age 
not on your life 
tradition john  discipline 
prepare them for college 
and the rest will take care of itself 
  footsteps departing  
  creak    hits bongo drum  
    chuckling  
he starts walking around
towards my left 
creak  creak 
  hitting bongo drum  
 assume the position  mr dalton    
which means  
  keating  
all right  gentlemen 
  mr keating 
  mr dalton 
that was a pretty lame stunt
you pulled today 
you re siding with mr nolan 
what about carpe diem
and sucking all the marrow   
  out of life and all that 
  sucking the marrow out of life   
doesn t mean
choking on the bone 
there is a time for daring 
and there is a time for caution 
and a wise man understands
which is called for 
but i thought you d like that 
no 
you being expelled from school
is not daring to me  it s stupid 
 cause you ll miss some
golden opportunities 
yeah  like what 
like  if nothing else 
the opportunity to attend my classes 
got it  ace 
aye  aye  captain 
keep your head about you 
that goes
for the lot of you 
  yes  captain

  makes it a little difficult 
  how do you stand it

i don t want to be anywhere else 
  what s up 
  i just talked to my father 
he s making me quit the play
at henley hall 
but acting is everything to me 
i mean  
but he doesn t know  he  
i can see his point  we re not
a rich family like charlie s  i mean  
but he s planning the rest
of my life for me 
and he he s never asked me
what i want 
have you ever told your father
what you just told me 
about your passion for acting 
have you showed him that 
  i can t 
  why not 
i can t talk to him this way 
then you re acting for him too 
you re playing the part
of the dutiful son 
i know this sounds impossible 
but you have to talk to him 
you have to show him
who you are  what your heart is 
i know what he ll say 
he ll tell me that acting s a whim
and i should forget it 
  sniffling  
they re counting on me 
he ll just tell me to put it
out of my mind for my own good 
you are not
an indentured servant 
it s not a whim for you  you prove it to
him by your conviction and your passion 
you show him that 
and if he still doesn t believe you  
well  by then  you ll be out of school 
and you can do anything you want 
no 
  sniffling  
what about the play 
the show s tomorrow night 
then you have to talk
to him before tomorrow night

knavish sprite called robin goodfellow 
thou speak st aright 
i am that merry wanderer
of the night 
i jest to oberon
and make him smile   
when i a fat and bean fed
horse beguile    snorts  
  whinnies   neighing in the likeness
of a filly foal 
sometime lurk i
in a gossip s bowl   
in very likeness
of a roasted crab 
and when she drink 
against her lips i bob   
and on her withered dewlap
pour the ale 
  the wisest aunt
telling the saddest tale 
  he s good  he s really good 
sometime for three foot stool
mistaketh me 
then slip i from her bum 
down topples she and   tailor   cries   
and falls into a cough 
and then the whole quire
hold their hips and laugh   
and waxen in their mirth
nee e e eze   
    all laughing  
  and swear 
a merrier hour
was never wasted there 
but  room  fairy 
  here comes oberon 
  and here  my mistress 
would that he were gone 
  lysander   then by your side 
no bed room me deny 
for lying so  hermia 
i do not lie 
  hermia   lysander riddles very
prettily  much beshrew my manners   
and my pride if hermia
meant to say lysander lied 
but  gentle friend 
for love and courtesy   
lie further off 
in human modesty 
such separation as may well be said
becomes a virtuous bachelor and maid 
good night  sweet friend  thy love
ne er alter  til thy sweet life end 
  lysander   amen 
amen to that fair prayer  say i 
 and then end life when i end loyalty 
    girl   neil  that s your cue  neil 
come on  neil 
here s your crown  let s go 
if we shadows have offended   
think but this
and all is mended 
that you have but slumber d here
while these visions did appear 
and this weak and idle theme 
no more yielding but a dream 
gentles  do not reprehend 
if you pardon  we will mend 
and as i am an honest puck 
if we have unearned luck 
now to  scape
the serpent s tongue 
we will make amends ere long 
else the puck a liar call 
so  good night
unto you all 
give me your hands
if we be friends 
and robin shall
restore amends

todd anderson 
  hello  son 
  hello  darling 
  softly  
mom 
have a seat  mr anderson 
mr anderson  i think we ve pretty well
put together what s happened here 
you do admit to being a part
of this dead poets society 
answer him  todd 
  softly  
yes  sir 
i have here
a detailed description   
of what occurred at your meetings 
it describes how your teacher 
mr keating 
encouraged you boys
to organize this club   
and to use it as a source
of inspiration   
for reckless
and self indulgent behaviour 
it describes how mr keating 
both in and out of the classroom 
encouraged neil perry to follow
his obsession with acting   
when he knew all along it was
against the explicit orders   
of neil s parents 
it was mr keating s blatant abuse
of his position as teacher   
that led directly
to neil perry s death 
read that document carefully 
todd 
very carefully 
if you ve nothing
to add or amend  sign it 
what s gonna happen
to mr keating 
  mr anderson sighs  
i ve had enough  sign the paper  todd 
  mcallister  
grass is gramen or herba 
lapis is stone 
the entire building
is aedificium 
  chuckles softly  
  door opens  closes  
sit 
i ll be teaching this
class through exams 
we ll find a permanent english teacher
during the break 
who will tell me where you are
in the pritchard textbook 
mr anderson 
  uh  in the  in the prit  
  i can t hear you  mr anderson 
  stammering  
in the  in the  in the pritchard  
kindly inform me 
mr cameron 
we skipped around a lot  sir 
we covered the romantics and some of the
chapters on post civil war literature 
  what about the realists 
  we skipped most of that  sir 
all right  then 
we ll start over 
what is poetry 
    knocking  
  come 
excuse me 
  closes door  
i came for my personals 
should i come back

mr keating 
gentlemen  turn to page 2 1
of the introduction 
mr cameron 
read aloud the excellent essay
by dr pritchard   
on   understanding poetry    
that page has been
ripped out  sir 
well  borrow
somebody else s book 
they re all ripped out  sir 
  nolan chuckling   what do you mean 
  they re all ripped out   
  sir  we   ac  
    nolan   never mind 
  slaps book  
read 
  cameron      understanding poetry 
by drj  evans pritchard  ph d 
  to fully understand poetry 
we must first be fluent   
  with its metre  rhyme
and figures of speech 
  then ask two questions 
one 
  how artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered 
  and  two 
  how important
is that objective 
  question one
rates the poem s perfection 
  question two rates its importance 
 and once these questions
have been answered 
  determining a poem s greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter 
if the poem s score for perfection is
plotted on the horizontal of a graph    
  mr keating 
they made everybody sign it 
  quiet  mr anderson 
  you ve got to believe me  it s true 
  i do believe you  todd 
  leave  mr keating
