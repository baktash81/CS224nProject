o captain my captain
who knows
where that comes from
anybody
coughing
blowing nose
not a clue
its from a poem by walt whitman
about mr abraham lincoln
now in this class you can
either call me mr keating
or if youre slightly more daring
o captain my captain
scattered snickering
now let me dispel a few rumours
so they dont fester into facts
yes i too attended hellton
and survived
and no at that time i was not
the mental giant you see before you
i was the intellectual equivalent
of a 98pound weakling
i would go to the beach and people
would kick copies of byron in my face
chuckling
now mr pitts
thats a rather
unfortunate name
mr pitts where are you
boys snickering
mr pitts would you open
your hymnal to page 542
read the first stanza
of the poem you find there
spaz coughs
to the virgins
to make much of time
keating
yes thats the one
somewhat appropriate isnt it
boys chuckling
pitts
gather ye rosebuds while ye may
old time is still aflying
and this same flower that smiles today
tomorrow will be dying
thank you mr pitts
gather ye rosebuds while ye may
the latin term for that sentiment
is carpe diem
now who knows what that means
carpe diem
thats seize the day
very good mister
meeks
meeks
another unusual name
seize the day
gather ye rosebuds while ye may
why does the writer
use these lines
because hes in a hurry
no ding
thank you
for playing anyway
because we are food
for worms lads
because believe it or not
each and every one of us in this room
is one day going to stop breathing
turn cold and die
i would like you
to step forward over here
and peruse some of the faces
from the past
youve walked past them
many times i dont think
youve really looked at them
theyre not that different
from you are they
same haircuts
full of hormones
just like you
invincible just like you feel
the world is their oyster
they believe theyre destined for
great things just like many of you
their eyes are full of hope
just like you
did they wait
until it was too late
to make from their lives even one iota
of what they were capable
because you see gentlemen these
boys are now fertilizing daffodils
but if you listen
real close
you can hear them whisper
their legacy to you
go on lean in
listen
do you hear it
keating whispering
carpe
hear it
whispering
carpe
continues whispering
carpe diem
seize the day boys

very funny dalton
radio static
that wouldnt be a radio in your lap

no sir science experiment
radar
radio continues humming
gentlemen open your text
to page 2 1 of the introduction
mr perry will you read
the opening paragraph of the preface
entitled
understanding poetry
understand poetry
by dr j evans pritchard phd
to fully understand poetry
we must first be fluent
with its metre rhyme
and figures of speech
then ask two questions
one how artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered
and two how important
is that objective
question one rates
the poems perfection
question two rates
its importance
and once these questions
have been answered
determining a poems greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter
if the poems score
for perfection is plotted
on the horizontal
of a graph
and its importance
is plotted on the vertical
then calculating
the total area of the poem
yields the measure
of its greatness
a sonnet by byron might
score high on the vertical
but only average
on the horizontal
a shakespearean sonnet
on the other hand
would score high both
horizontally and vertically
yielding
a massive total area
thereby revealing
the poem to be truly great
as you proceed through the poetry in
this book practise this rating method
as your ability to evaluate
poems in this manner grows
so will so will your enjoyment
and understanding of poetry
excrement
thats what i think
of mr j evans pritchard
were not laying pipe
were talking about poetry
i mean how can you describe poetry
like american bandstand
i like byron i give him a 42
but i cant dance to it
now i want you
to rip out that page
go on
rip out the entire page
you heard me
rip it out
rip it out
go on
rip it out
thank you mr dalton
gentlemen tell you what
dont just tear out that page
tear out the entire introduction
i want it gone history leave nothing
rip it out rip be gone
j evans pritchard phd
rip shred tear
rip it out i want to hear nothing
but ripping of mr pritchard
well perforate it put it on a roll
boys chuckling
its not the bible
youre not gonna go to hell for this
boys chuckling
mumbling
go on make a clean tear
i want nothing left of it
boys chattering
we shouldnt be doing this
rip rip rip
keating
rip it out rip
boys chattering
pages ripping
boys laughing
rip it yeah rip it out
muffled chattering laughing
boy  rip it
what the hell is going on here
i dont hear enough rips
mr keating
mr mcallister
im sorry i
i didnt know you were here
i am
ah so you are
excuse me
keating
keep ripping gentlemen
this is a battle a war
and the casualties could be
your hearts and souls
thank you mr dalton
armies of academics
going forward measuring poetry
no we will not
have that here
no more
of mrj evans pritchard
now my class you will learn
to think for yourselves again
you will learn
to savour words and language
no matter what
anybody tells you
words and ideas
can change the world
i see that look
in mr pitts eye
like 1 9th century literature
has nothing to do
with going to business school
or medical school
right maybe
mr hopkins you may agree
with him thinking
yes we should simply study
our mr pritchard
and learn our rhyme and metre
and go quietly about the business
of achieving other ambitions
i have a little secret for you
huddle up
huddle up
we dont read and write
poetry because its cute
we read and write poetry because
we are members of the human race
and the human race
is filled with passion
medicine law
business engineering
these are noble pursuits
and necessary to sustain life
but poetry
beauty romance love
these are what
we stay alive for
to quote from whitman
o me o life of the questions
of these recurring
of the endless trains
of the faithless
of cities filled
with the foolish
what good amid these
o me o life
answer
that you are here
that life exists
and identity
that the powerful play
goes on
and you may contribute
a verse
that the powerful play
goes on
and you may contribute
a verse
what will your verse be
all  for what we are
about to receive
may the lord make us
truly grateful
amen
quite an interesting class
you gave today mr keating
sorry if i shocked you mr mcallister
theres no need to apologise
it was very fascinating
misguided though it was
you think so
you take a big risk by encouraging them
to become artistsjohn
when they realize that theyre
not rembrandts shakespeares or mozarts
theyll hate you for it
were not talking artists george
were talking freethinkers
freethinkers at 1 7
funny i never pegged you
as a cynic
not a cynic
a realist
show me the heart unfettered
by foolish dreams
and ill show you
a happy man
but only in their dreams
can men be truly free
twas always thus
and always thus will be

gentlemen can you keep a secret

the dead poets were dedicated
to sucking the marrow out of life
thats a phrase from thoreau wed invoke
at the beginning of every meeting
you see we would gather
at the old indian cave
and take turns reading from thoreau
whitman shelley the biggies
even some of our own verse
and in the enchantment of the moment
wed let poetry work its magic
you mean it was a bunch of guys
sitting around reading poetry
no mr overstreet
it wasnt just guys
we werent a greek organization
we were romantics
we didnt just read poetry we let it
drip from our tongues like honey
spirits soared women swooned
and gods were created gentlemen

it was a dark and rainy night
and this old lady
who had a passion
for jigsaw puzzles
sat by herself in her house at her table
to complete a new jigsaw puzzle
but as she pieced
the puzzle together
she realized
to her astonishment
that the image that was formed
was her very own room
and the figure
in the centre of the puzzle
as she completed it
was herself
and with trembling hands
she placed the last four pieces
and stared in horror at the face
of a demented madman at the window
the last thing that
this old lady ever heard
was the sound of breaking glass
no she didnt
laughing chattering
yes this is true this is true
ive got one thats better than that
charlie laughs
i do theres a young
married couple
and theyre driving through the forest
at night on a long trip

last year
in a mean abode
in the shanking road

come my friends
tis not too late
to seek a newer world
for my purpose holds
to sail beyond the sunset
and though we are not
now that strength
which in old days
moved earth and heaven
that which we are we are
one equal temper
of heroic hearts
made weak by time and fate
but strong in will
to strive to seek to find
and not to yield
then i had religion
then i had a vision
i could not turn from
their revel in derision
then i saw the congo
creeping through the black
cutting through the forest
with a golden track
then i saw the congo
creeping through the black
chanting  meeks meeks
cutting through the forest
with a golden track
then i saw the congo

something very interesting

look at things in a different way
see the world looks
very different from up here
you dont believe me
come see for yourselves
come on
come onjust when you
think you know something
you have to look at it
in another way
even though it may seem
silly or wrong
you must try
now when you read dont just
consider what the author thinks
consider what you think
jumps down
boys you must strive
to find your own voice
because the longer
you wait to begin
the less likely you are
to find it at all
thoreau said most men lead
lives of quiet desperation
dont be resigned to that
break out
dont just walk off the edge
like lemmings look around you
bell ringing

mr overstreet
driven by a deeper force yes
we know that all right now i didnt
bring them up here to ridicule them
i brought them up here to
illustrate the point of conformity
the difficulty in maintaining your
own beliefs in the face of others
now i see the look in your eyes like
i would have walked differently
well ask yourselves
why you were clapping
now we all have a great need
for acceptance
but you must trust that
your beliefs are unique your own
even though others may think
them odd or unpopular
even though the herd may go
thats baaaaad
boys laughing
keating  robert frost said
two roads diverged in the wood and i
i took the one less traveled by
and that has made
all the difference

pacing any direction
anything you want whether its proud
whether its silly anything

in fact
id like to announce
i published an article in the school
paper in the name of the dead poets
what
demanding girls
be admitted to welton
you didnt
so we can all stop beating off
how did you do that
charlie  im one of the proofers
i slipped the article in
itsits over now
why
nobody knows who we are
well dont you think
theyre gonna figure out who wrote it
theyre gonna come to you and ask
to know what the dead poets society is
charlie you had no right
to do something like that
its nuwanda cameron
gloria
thats right its nuwanda
are we just playing around out here
or do we mean what we say
if all we do is come together
and read a bunch of poems to each other
what the hell are we doing
neil  all right
but you still shouldnt
have done it charlie
this could mean trouble
you dont speak for the club
hey would you not worry about
your precious little neck
if they catch me
ill tell them i made it up
whispering
fine
sit
in this weeks issue
of welton honor
there appeared a profane
and unauthorized article
rather than spend my valuable time
ferreting out the guilty persons
and let me assure you
i will find them
im asking any and all students
who know anything about this article
to make themselves known
here and now
whoever the guilty persons are
this is your only chance to avoid
expulsion from this school
phone ringing
teachers murmuring
welton academy
hello
yes he is
just a moment
mr nolan its for you
its god
he says we should have girls
at welton
boys laughing
wipe that smirk off your face
if you think mr dalton
that youre the first to try to get
thrown out of this school think again
others have had similar notions and have
failed just as surely as you will fail
assume the position
sighs

the name is nuwanda
door closes
both chuckling
excuse me
may we have a word mr keating
certainly
this was my first classroomjohn
did you know that
my first desk
i didnt know you taught
mr nolan
english
long before your time
it was hard giving it up
i can tell you
im hearing rumours
about some unorthodox
teaching methods in your classroom
im not saying theyve had anything
to do with the dalton boys outburst
but i dont think i have to warn you
boys his age are very impressionable
well your reprimand made
quite an impression im sure
what was going on
in the courtyard the other day
courtyard
boys marching clapping in unison
oh that
that was an exercise to prove a point
dangers of conformity
welljohn the curriculum here is set
its proven it works
if you question it whats to
prevent them from doing the same
i always thought the idea of education
was to learn to think for yourself
at these boys age
not on your life
traditionjohn discipline
prepare them for college
and the rest will take care of itself
footsteps departing
creak  hits bongo drum
chuckling
he starts walking around
towards my left
creak creak
hitting bongo drum
assume the position mr dalton
which means
keating
all right gentlemen
mr keating
mr dalton
that was a pretty lame stunt
you pulled today
youre siding with mr nolan
what about carpe diem
and sucking all the marrow
out of life and all that
sucking the marrow out of life
doesnt mean
choking on the bone
there is a time for daring
and there is a time for caution
and a wise man understands
which is called for
but i thought youd like that
no
you being expelled from school
is not daring to me its stupid
cause youll miss some
golden opportunities
yeah like what
like if nothing else
the opportunity to attend my classes

laughing
whispering  hey there he is

keating
shh boys
either i mistake your shape
and making quite
or else you are that shrewd and
knavish sprite called robin goodfellow
thou speakst aright
i am that merry wanderer
of the night
i jest to oberon
and make him smile
when i a fat and beanfed
horse beguile  snorts
whinnies  neighing in the likeness
of a filly foal
sometime lurk i
in a gossips bowl
in very likeness
of a roasted crab
and when she drink
against her lips i bob
and on her withered dewlap
pour the ale
the wisest aunt
telling the saddest tale
hes good hes really good
sometime for threefoot stool
mistaketh me
then slip i from her bum
down topples she and tailor cries
and falls into a cough
and then the whole quire
hold their hips and laugh
and waxen in their mirth
neeeeeze
all laughing
and swear
a merrier hour
was never wasted there
but room fairy
here comes oberon
and here my mistress
would that he were gone
lysander  then by your side
no bedroom me deny
for lying so hermia
i do not lie
hermia  lysander riddles very
prettily much beshrew my manners
and my pride if hermia
meant to say lysander lied
but gentle friend
for love and courtesy
lie further off
in human modesty
such separation as may well be said
becomes a virtuous bachelor and maid
good night sweet friend thy love
neer alter til thy sweet life end
lysander  amen
amen to that fair prayer say i
and then end life when i end loyalty
girl  neil thats your cue neil
come on neil
heres your crown lets go
if we shadows have offended
think but this
and all is mended
that you have but slumberd here
while these visions did appear
and this weak and idle theme
no more yielding but a dream
gentles do not reprehend
if you pardon we will mend
and as i am an honest puck
if we have unearned luck
now to scape
the serpents tongue
we will make amends ere long
else the puck a liar call
so good night
unto you all
give me your hands
if we be friends
and robin shall
restore amends

todd anderson
hello son
hello darling
softly
mom
have a seat mr anderson
mr anderson i think weve pretty well
put together whats happened here
you do admit to being a part
of this dead poets society
answer him todd
softly
yes sir
i have here
a detailed description
of what occurred at your meetings
it describes how your teacher
mr keating
encouraged you boys
to organize this club
and to use it as a source
of inspiration
for reckless
and selfindulgent behaviour
it describes how mr keating
both in and out of the classroom
encouraged neil perry to follow
his obsession with acting
when he knew all along it was
against the explicit orders
of neils parents
it was mr keatings blatant abuse
of his position as teacher
that led directly
to neil perrys death
read that document carefully
todd
very carefully
if youve nothing
to add or amend sign it
whats gonna happen
to mr keating
mr anderson sighs
ive had enough sign the paper todd
mcallister

kindly inform me
mr cameron
we skipped around a lot sir
we covered the romantics and some of the
chapters on postcivil war literature
what about the realists
we skipped most of that sir
all right then
well start over
what is poetry
knocking
come
excuse me
closes door
i came for my personals
should i come back
after class
get them now
mr keating
gentlemen turn to page 2 1
of the introduction
mr cameron
read aloud the excellent essay
by dr pritchard
on understanding poetry
that page has been
ripped out sir
well borrow
somebody elses book
theyre all ripped out sir
nolan chuckling  what do you mean
theyre all ripped out
sir we ac
nolan  never mind
slaps book
read
cameron  understanding poetry
by drj evans pritchard phd
to fully understand poetry
we must first be fluent
with its metre rhyme
and figures of speech
then ask two questions
one
how artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered
and two
how important
is that objective
question one
rates the poems perfection
question two rates its importance
and once these questions
have been answered
determining a poems greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter
if the poems score for perfection is
plotted on the horizontal of a graph
mr keating
they made everybody sign it
quiet mr anderson
youve got to believe me its true
i do believe you todd
leave mr keating
but it wasnt his fault
sit down mr anderson one more
outburst from you or anyone else
and youre out
of this school
