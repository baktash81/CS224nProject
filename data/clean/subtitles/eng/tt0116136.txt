to rebuild this ruin 
yes 
yes  it will 
not so rebellious now 
you should thank me  boy 
it was my stroke made you king 
no  brok  i want no martyrs 
death should be a release 
not a punishment 
look good  dog

you ll ever see 
burn the insolence
out of his eyes 
no  no 
not my eyes  no 
father 
run 
how dare you defy me 
einon  you re unwell 
you ve been bewitched 
look at this 
it s madness 
  remember the code 
  the king is above the code 
have you forgotten
everything i taught you 
no one is above the code   
especially the king 
dragon  i loved that boy 
and you changed him 
you tricked me  dragon 
no matter where you fly   
no matter where you go 
i will find you 
today i make a new vow 
i will spend the rest of my life
hunting you down 
avalon  oh  avalon 
for you i quest each day   
the resting place of arthur   
and the old code of his way 
and when i find
those holy stones   
i ll pray  i ll pray  i ll pray 
oh  avalon  bright avalon   
think me not a fool 
my quest is not for vanity 
my quest is spiritual 
spiritual 
merlin  spiritual 
whoa  merlin 
merlin  ow 
everyone s a critic 
  dragon  dragon 
  yes  i know  where 
there  there 
get back here  horse 
you coward 
marvelous  heroics befitting the days
of arthur and the round table 
never have i seen such skill 
then you must have lived
the sheltered life   
of a mon   monk 
why  yes  a scribe  scholar 
historian and poet 
your servant  sir 
brother gilbert of glockenspur 
my humble life is in debt
to your exalted prowess   
your dauntless courage 
and your superb  swift sword 
you have the poet s gift
of exaggeration 
sir  you should read
my histories 
but you belittle your talent 
modesty as well as valor 
the code of ancient camelot
still lives 
hardly worthy of camelot 
still  it s one less dragon 
well done  knight 
congratulations 
our gratitude 
mine and king einon s 
uh  you can keep your gratitude 
i ll take the gold 
  yours or the king s 
  gold  knight 
we made a bargain  remember 
one dragon put down  one bag of gold 
your honor has a price 
sir knight 
it has expenses 
honor won t feed my belly
nor shoe my horse 
the priest is right 
it is your duty to protect king einon s
vassals as a knight of the realm 
not of this realm 
i bend no knee to einon 
i should have known 
foreign riffraff 
well  begone  vagabond 
before i arrest you 
back to work  you scum 
if king einon s wheat
isn t cut before the rain   
i ll do a little cutting
of my own 
sir knight 
sir knight  wait 
sir knight 
hear me out 
i m on a pilgrimage 
might we travel together 
the road s still free 
unless einon s taxed it 
a road tax  king einon  hmm 
a road tax 
they are your roads  after all 
people really ought to pay
for the privilege of using them 
  and those that can t pay will have to work it off 
  ingenious  felton 
only you could keep such a good brain
under such a bad hat 
that s very good   bad hat  
out of my way  peacock 
brok  some are good at hunting men 
some are good at hunting money 
both have value for me 
kara 
kara  i told you   
  i told you not to come here anymore 
  i m a disobedient child 
go on  take a drink  go on 
magnificent shot  your highness 
  care to double the wager 
  ah  yes  happily 
shall we say the water bucket 
stand still  stand still 
superb 
double again 
double again  why not 
i say 
a moving target 
peasant scum 
you ve got a nerve 
interfering with the king s sport 
there s no sport in tormenting a sick  old man 
i beg your majesty 
let him go 
it s been 12 years 
your castle is built 
he can do you no more harm 
for god s sake  release him 
father 
i ve always said death is a release 
not a punishment 
go 
kara 
yoo hoo 
yoo hoo 
i ve decided to compose
 the ballad of bowen  
  how do you prefer i should write this 
  far away 
oh  don t concern yourself
with my safety 
i mean verse  meter 
shall i spice it up
with a poetical flourish   
or just the cold  hard facts 
if you do not be quiet   
you and i shall be the only things
that are cold and hard around here 
i mean  it s all very well to go
hacking and whacking at dragons 
but if a dragon falls in the forest and
nobody gets to hear about it  does it make a thud 
  brother gilbert 
  what 
the quill is mightier than the s   
ooh 
the quill is mightier than the   
that s all that s left
of the last dragonslayer   
who tangled with me 
if i were you 
i d quit while i was ahead 
is that the best you can do 
catch 
you know  i ve got quite
a collection of victims in here 
i won t be added to it 
i ve given you
my final warning 
into the mouth of death he strode 
into the gringy gloom 
into the pit of fear unknown   
perhaps to court his doom 
that was good 
what did i say 
what did i say 
a little damp for fire  isn t it 
why must you knight errants
out to make a name for yourselves   
always pick on us dragons 
i don t need a name 
and i have a collection of my own 
yeah  you re one
who kills dragons for money 
it s honest enough work 
one must earn a living 
oh  yes  one must live 
well  since you seek a profit 
we might as well begin 
oh  don t flatter yourself 
it s not the profit 
it s the pleasure 
perhaps less pleasurable
and more costly than you think 
bowen  bowen  take care 
he went that way 
take care  bowen 
you can t fly forever 
  neither can you 
  slow down 
come  visit the woods 
whoa 
look out  well done 
  ow 
  pity  that must have hurt 
  yeah 
  again 
  ow 
  and again 
how do you like the ride so far 
we re earning our money now 
aren t we 
now  is there somewhere you
would like me to drop you off 
yikes 
the sword against the fang and claw 
the flame against the shield 
blah  blah  blah 
which one would win 
blah  blah 
field  shield  wield 
whose flesh from bones
be peeled  oh  no 
whose fate would soon be sealed 
whose fate would soon be sealed 
whose fate would soon be sealed 
oh  you re good  haven t had
this sort of challenge in some time 
nor likely to again 
drat 
a little overconfident  aren t we 
hardly  but if you win 
you ll be out of work 
i will not stop until i ve rid the world
of every last one of you 
i am the last one 
you re just trying to save
your scaly hide with tricks 
haven t you noticed the pickings
are rather slim these days 
i got me one just the other day 
so it was you who killed the scarred one 
she and i were the last 
must ve been a proud kill  warrior 
how much gold did her tattered carcass
put in your purse 
that s none of your business 
couldn t have been very much 
and you ll kill me for sport 
and when there are
no more dragons to slay   
how will you make
a living  knight 
shut up 
whoa 
if your teeth come down  my sword
goes up  right into your brain 
if your sword goes up 
my teeth come down 
into the moonlit night
the titans dueled   
in mortal combat bound 
oh  who d the fatal
false step make 
whose blood
would stain the ground 
oh  good lord 
sir eglamore 
oh  thank you very much 
it s been stuck down there
for months 
can you get your buttocks
off my tongue 
why should you be comfortable 
my armor is rusting in your drool 
and your breath is absolutely foul 
well  what do you expect   
with old knights rotting
between my molars 
oh  god  my mouth is so dry 
no  no  no  stop 
no  stop 
sorry about that 
it seems we re in a bit of a stalemate 
wouldn t you say 
yuck  but i can go
three days without sleep 
i can go three weeks 
ooh 
i ll stab you before i nod off 
and i ll chomp you 
marvelous  we ll kill each other 
  what do you suggest 
  a truce 
get out of my mouth
and let s talk face to face 
how do i know i can trust you 
i give you my word 
the word of a dragon 
it s worthless 
stubborn lout 
i should have known 
go on  kill me 
i don t want to kill you 
i never did 
and i don t want you to kill me 
how do we gain 
if you win  you lose a trade 
if i win  i wait around
for the next sword slinger   
thirsting to carve a reputation
out of my hide 
and i m tired of lurking in holes   
and skulking in darkness 
i m gonna let you up now 
and if you insist   
we can pursue this fracas
to its final stupidity 
or you can listen
to my alternative 
hmm 
what s the alternative 
father  father  look 
dragon 
out of the way 
out of the way 
out of the way 
pesky critters  dragons 
you 
like big rats 
you never seem to get rid of them 
unless you pay me
two bags of gold  in advance 
come on  dragon 
come on  dragon 
yes 
ow 
hmm 
hello 
twenty eight  twenty nine 
most profitable  dragon 
i should have met you a long time ago 
there is much gold in the world 
perhaps when you ve had your fill of it 
you ll no longer need me 
i am a knight of the old code 
my word is my bond 
  no compunctions then 
  about what 
well  such deception hardly befits
a knight of the old code 
fleecing einon s lackeys 
that s a service to mankind 
is it 
when you squeeze the nobility 
it s the peasants who feel the pinch 
that s not my concern 
why should i stick my neck out
for people afraid to risk their own 
don t clutter up
a clever scheme with morality 
mmm  so be it   
knight of the old code 
if i wanted my conscience pricked 
i would have stayed with the priest 
huh  and what does a dragon
know of the old code  anyway 
his blade defends the helpless 
his might upholds the weak 
his word speaks only truth 
shut up  i remember 
that s all it is  a memory 
nothing can bring it back 
you sound like one who tried 
and failed 
so i no longer try to change the world 
dragon  i just try to get by in it 
yes  it s better than death 
i suppose 
oh  is it  i should think
you d welcome death 
you know  the last of your kind 
all your friends dead 
hunted wherever you go 
do you delight in reminding me 
yes  knight 
i do long for death 
but fear it 
why  aside from your misery 
what s to lose 
my soul 
finish him  brok 
well  are you a man 
should he continue  mother 
oh  the field belongs to the apparently
inexhaustible sir brok  my son 
the quarry 
first you beg mercy
for your father s fate 
then you try to avenge it 
now  you ll share it 
in your kingdom  einon 
there are worse fates than death 
i ll think one up for you 
  take her away 
  no  no 
he killed my father 
he killed my father 
he killed my father 
i remember you now 
i remember you 
your hair  like fire 
you gave me this scar 
didn t you 
i   owe   you 
i can  uh   
i really can 
sorry  bowen 
i hope you like it well done 
you must have hated us very much 
i hated one of you 
these i killed because i wanted
to kill him  but i never found him 
i never will 
if you re the last  he must be dead 
oh  yes 
tell me  what was he like   
this  uh  dragon
that you hated 
he only had half a heart 
but even that was enough
to pollute an innocent boy 
einon was no innocent 
he polluted the heart 
how do you know that 
how do you know that  dragon 
all dragons know that story 
what was to be their hope
became their doom 
a spoiled  ungrateful child was given
a great gift and destroyed it 
no  i knew einon 
i was his teacher 
i taught him
the ways of honor  of right 
then he betrayed you   
just as he betrayed
the dragon whose heart he broke 
that s a lie  dragon 
stop calling me  dragon  
i have a name 
well  what is it 
you couldn t possibly pronounce it
in your tongue 
  try me 
  it s   
next time stab more flesh 
less cloth 
i ll pierce your heart 
you already did 
a very special heart 
like no other 
a black  withered thing
without pity 
then teach me 
pity me 
i ll give you everything 
even power 
you re so beautiful 
even power 
even a throne 
oh  dear 
thank you 
it s passed now 
what was it 
an old complaint
that acts up now and again 
forgive me if anything
i said  if i upset you 
it wasn t you  not you 
don t be afraid 
i won t let you suffer
the same fate as me 
i ve come to help you 
this will bring you out
well below the castle walls 
thank   
you 
have you been watching over me
all night 
i ve been thinking 
yes  about what 
many things 
mostly about what to call you 
i think i ve found you a name 
you say that as though you reached up
and plucked it from the sky 
i did 
up there 
do you see that group of stars 
i know those stars very well 
  do you see the shape that they make 
  mm hmm  a dragon 
yes 
they call it  draco  
it means  dragon 
in the scholars  speech 
so instead of calling me
 dragon  in your tongue   
you ll call me  dragon 
in some other tongue 
you re right 
it s silly 
no  no  i would be honored
to be named after those stars 
i   i truly would 
thank you  bowen 
draco 
throw off the yoke
of einon s oppression 
we must start to fight back 
your father sang that sour tune once 
and we did fight back 
and once was enough 
we ll not dance to it again 
no  hewe  just cringe
like a dog under einon s boot 
at least a cringing dog s
a live one 
hey  why waste good food
on bad rhetoric 
i speak the truth 
truth 
it s rarely inspiring  lass 
and it never wins rebellions   
but it will stretch necks 
if there is a neck   
underneath that little mud pie 
ready or not  here i come 
dragon 
it s draco 
about time 
mmm 
it seems you people
are in need of a dragonslayer 
where is the lord responsible
for this village 
brok lives in a big house
about six miles away 
but he ll only blame any damage on us
and pluck our pockets to pay for it 
i won t pluck them as deeply 
i ll make you a fair offer 
take it  or leave him 
it s enough you people
grovel to einon 
will you be bullied by some broken down 
blackmailing knight as well 
that s right  you don t need me 
settle it yourself 
of course  there are other ways 
perhaps you ll part with   
one of your precious daughters 
instead of gold 
dragons are partial
to maiden sacrifices  i hear 
don t do this 
don t do this to me 
i was born in this village 
you knew my father 
you knew my mother 
  who s the girl 
  a nuisance  get rid of her 
  why 
  they re trying to placate you with a sacrifice 
now  whoever gave them that bright idea 
  never mind  just get rid of her 
  how 
  eat her 
  oh  please  yuck 
aren t we squeamish 
you ate sir eglamore  hypocrite 
i merely chewed in self defense 
but i never swallowed 
improvise 
all right  all right 
he s coming  quick 
you have a beautiful voice 
oh  thank you  we dragons
love to sing when we re happy 
well  you re not like a dragon at all 
well  how many dragons do you know 
well  you re the first 
you should never listen
to minstrels  fancies 
a dragon would never hurt a soul 
unless they tried to hurt him first 
really 
then why were you in my village 
oh  the village 
yes  the village 
you remember the village 
leave him alone  you bully 
run  draco  fly  i ll hold him 
  pick on someone your own size 
  where have you been 
i m truly sorry  bowen 
i ve been distracted 
bowen  meet kara 
  you should have eaten her 
  oh  don t get angry  bowen 
why not 
you left me high and dry 
i was worried to death 
worried  about me 
yes  about you 
i had the whacker all set up 
half the village is out there with me 
we re searching the skies for you 
i don t know where you are 
if you re coming back 
when you re coming back  you just   
disappear 
be careful 
he s coming 
well  well  well 
it can t be 
but it is 
my old mentor 
still giving carving lessons 
get off your horse 
i ll give you one 
time s not been
kind to you  bowen 
  you should never have broke with me 
  it was you who broke with me 
and yet you return to me
with this girl i lost 
i think she wants to stay lost 
not her decision  i m afraid 
i m ready for my lesson now  knight 
that s one lesson you never learned 
only expose your back to a corpse 
you are a corpse 
you just don t know it 
lie down  bowen 
you re the sorry scrap
of dead worlds and dead beliefs 
no  they were your beliefs 
never  never mine 
you said the words 
you spoke them from your heart 
i vomited them up
because i couldn t stomach them 
because i knew it was
what you wanted to hear 
lies  liar 
i taught you 
you taught me to fight 
that s all 
i took what i needed from you 
you taught me to fight 
you taught me well 
who asked you to interfere 
i had everything under control 
here  let me see 
it s knitted well 
you have a healer s touch  kara 
in a few days 
it ll be just another scar 
and what s one more scar 
to a knight  i mean 
i once knew a knight 
he stood all alone
against an evil king   
and even saved a rebel leader
from blinding 
he must have had many scars 
  that knight died of his wounds long ago 
  that s too bad 
his kind is badly missed
in this world 
  that s the way the wretched world is  girl 
  doesn t have to be 
men like you could   
could lead others 
you could give people
courage and hope 
hope  even if you
could raise your army   
do you think they d stand a chance
against seasoned troops 
last time they tried
it was a massacre 
  i remember  i was there 
  so was i 
that rebel was my father 
let others stand with you  you ll see
this time the end will be different 
what are you looking at 
myself  once upon a time 
i ll see you in the village  draco 
that s easy for you to say 
this time i ll collect the money 
and you can die 
we can lose no more pigs
to this dragon 
wait 
this man is a fraud 
it s her 
this girl is a   
wandering idiot 
she babbles nonsense 
i m telling you 
this knight is no dragonslayer 
you re mistaken  my child 
he s the greatest dragonslayer
there is 
possibly the greatest
there ever will be 
  brother gilbert 
  bowen 
you re alive 
praised be the saints 
the saints be blessed 
you re alive 
  and whole 
  brother gilbert 
you could not put your trust
in a better man 
i personally have seen him slay
almost two dragons 
  oh  brother gilbert 
  almost 
well  i didn t actually see
the death blow of the second   
but as bowen is here 
he must have won 
don t you see 
he s in league with the dragon 
hold that there 
and here he comes 
sink  sink 
i can t 
it doesn t get any deeper 
well done  bowen 
you ve done it again 
what a brute 
that s even bigger than the last one 
actually  he s about the same size 
  meat 
  meat 
meat  meat 
oh  dear 
run  he s getting away 
what s going on 
meat 
  meat  meat 
  meat 
run  that s what s going on 
  run 
  run 
kara  kara 
peace  brothers  peace 
heathens 
brother gilbert 
oh  good lord 
forgive me  my child 
liar  liar 
no dragon  no charge 
meat  meat 
meat  meat 
meat  meat  meat 
we re going to die 
god help us 
we re all going to die 
calm yourself  brother gilbert 
we re not going to die 
we re just flying 
if you re going
to get yourself killed   
you might as well do it
in the fight against einon 
i think kara has a point  oh 
but i d rather discuss it
on the ground 
draco  what unholy place is this 
unholy 
this is avalon  the resting place
of king arthur himself 
so it was foretold   
and so have i found you 
brave king arthur 
valor 
virtue  truth 
ah  yes  truth 
amen  ready now  kara 
and you  bowen 
this is avalon 
the shadow realm of the round table 
  it s a divine omen 
  omens won t win battles 
nor will you 
and you ll find out
when you try to raise your army 
you already know
the courage in your village 
they re very brave at pelting
young girls with vegetables 
it must start somewhere 
will you wish us luck  draco 
long ago  when man was young
and the dragon already old   
the wisest of our race
took pity on man 
he gathered together all the dragons   
making them vow
to watch over man always 
and at the moment of his death   
the night became alive
with those stars 
and thus was born
the dragons  heaven 
but when we die  not all dragons
are admitted to this shining place 
no  we have to earn it 
and if we don t   
our spirit disappears
as if we never were 
and that s why i shared my life force
with a dying boy   
so i would reunite man and dragon   
and ensure my place
among my ancient brothers of the sky 
but my sacrifice
became my sin 
it was you 
your heart beats in einon s breast 
yes  my half heart   
that cost me all of my soul 
even then i knew
his bloodthirsty nature   
but i thought my heart
could change him 
my god  i was so naive 
no more than i 
all my life i ve dreamed
of serving noble kings   
noble ideals 
dreams die hard   
and you hold them in your hands
long after they ve turned to dust 
i will not be that naive again 
kara  i will go with you 
so be it 
farewell  bowen 
valor 
valor 
valor 
a knight is sworn to valor 
a knight is sworn to valor 
a knight is sworn to valor 
his heart knows only virtue 
his heart knows only virtue 
his blade defends the helpless 
his blade defends the helpless 
his might upholds the weak 
his might upholds the weak 
his word speaks only truth 
his word speaks only truth 
his wrath undoes the wicked 
his wrath undoes the wicked 
now i know you re completely mad 
  you want us to follow you
and a priest against einon 
  yes 
  to hell  more like    but this time we can win 
you don t understand 
i don t want to understand 
i understand this 
i understand six years in a quarry 
that s all i need to understand 
believe me  i know what you ve
been through  hewe 
  but this time we ve been joined   
  only a fool would join you 
you re not listening to what i m saying 
i ve had enough
of your mischief 
save your strength
for the fight against einon 
  there isn t any fight against einon 
  i m going to start one 
you and what army  knight 
you have never fired
a bow in your life   
  in anger or in practice 
  no 
draw your bow 
sight along the arrow 
release 
beginner s luck 
try again 
steady 
brother gilbert  you re a natural 
easy 
here  widen your stance 
up  down  up  down 
one fluid stroke 
this could cleave
a man s skull 
like a pudding 
eat 
whoa  whoa 
  i need more men 
  it s just a few peasants waving pitchforks 
i noticed they re all on your land 
you re not too busy hawking in your old
age to keep control of your minions  are you 
you acuse me 
i was just saying that any one of us
is worth a hundred of them 
my brave felton 
an army unto himself 
well 
fool 
i know this man who leads them 
and i will not underestimate him 
him or the dragon 
don t be afraid of the dragon  my son 
i m afraid of nothing 
nothing 
you understand 
a mother s gift to her son 
the finest to be had 
the finest what 
dragonslayers 
have you thought beyond tomorrow 
it s hard to see that far 
look at the camp 
what do you see 
  what do you hear 
  hope 
exactly 
down there you have life 
songs and courage 
you have everything you ll ever need 
and now  so do i 
he dares defy me at my own gates 
look at him 
well  today his code
dies once and for all 
no 
we re safe here  your majesty 
that rabble couldn t possibly
storm the castle 
by tonight they ll be
cold and wet and tired 
they ll probably just limp off home 
we re safe here  einon 
remember your father 
gotcha 
bear to the right 
let s shear them
like the sheep they are 
to the forest 
form up 
form up 
halt  halt 
second line 
right flank  advance 
get in there 
second line 
charge 
scatter or die 
scatter or die  go 
like a pudding 
pride goeth before the fall 
help  help 
help  help 
turn the other cheek  brother 
retreat  retreat 
retreat 
return to the castle 
retreat 
brother gilbert  it s einon 
stop him 
thou   
shalt   
not   
kill 
the dragonslayers 
open up  it s the king 
stop 
no  i want it alive 
alive and safe 
safe for all eternity 
oh  no 
i go to save the dragon 
who will go with me 
come from the shadows  aislinn 
come where i can see you 
  you know why i ve come 
  i know 
in giving my heart  i ve taken on every
poison stirring in his evil breast 
even the pain of his death
must be mine 
you cannot blame yourself 
death without immortality 
that was not the only reason 
i had to wait for a time when mankind   
would not repeat my mistake
and let tyranny thrive 
when there would be those
who remembered the once ways   
remembered that even in the darkness
there is still light 
i cannot see 
are the stars shining tonight 
brightly  my lord 
brightly 
then let us end it 
forgive me 
i know why you brought me
the dragonslayers 
you wanted them to kill him
because you wanted me dead 
i wanted to correct
a mistake made years ago   
when i saved a creature
not worth saving 
how un motherly of you 
we have to open the gates 
the rest of us are waiting outside 
go save your dragon  bowen 
hurry  all of you 
it s this way 
well  well  well 
what a pleasant surprise 
i expected you  bowen 
but with my bride to be as well 
  and with a priest to wed us 
  to bury you 
well  to bury one of us 
kara  the door  quickly 
hurry up  that way 
that way 
quickly  this way 
this way 
come on  hurry up 
now  i don t know how
you all got in here   
but i tell you this 
you are going to get me out 
hewe  thank you 
let me cut it down to size for you 
a girl 
a girl 
bowen 
lo  i m immortal 
  yeah 
  huh 
now it s you  bowen 
it s you that has to do it 
what are you talking about 
as the heart binds einon to me in life 
it binds us in death 
  that s not true 
  you ve seen that it is 
through the heart  we share
each other s pains and power 
but in my half beats the life source 
for einon to die  i must die 
einon is dead 
  he lives 
  it doesn t matter 
don t you hear it 
our rebels have stormed the castle 
alive or dead  einon s beaten 
we ve won 
you will never win until einon s
evil is destroyed   
and to do that 
you must destroy me 
once you swore your sword
and service were mine   
to call when i had need of you 
to ask what i would of you 
i hold you to your vow  knight 
he s coming 
coming to stop you 
strike before it s too late 
you are the last 
my time is over  strike 
you are my friend 
then  as my friend  strike  please 
  i can t 
  then i will make you 
fight back  dragonslayer 
defend yourself 
pick it up 
move  and she dies 
what now  draco 
without you   
what do we do 
where do we turn 
to the stars  bowen 
to the stars 
and in the days following
draco s sacrifice   
bowen and kara led the people
in a time of justice and brotherhood 
as i remember it now 
those were golden years
