marvelous heroics befitting the days
of arthur and the round table
never have i seen such skill
then you must have lived
the sheltered life
of a monmonk
why yes a scribe scholar
historian and poet
your servant sir
brother gilbert of glockenspur
my humble life is in debt
to your exalted prowess
your dauntless courage
and your superb swift sword
you have the poets gift
of exaggeration
sir you should read
my histories
but you belittle your talent
modesty as well as valor
the code of ancient camelot
still lives
hardly worthy of camelot
still its one less dragon
well done knight
congratulations
our gratitude
mine and king einons
uh you can keep your gratitude
ill take the gold
yours or the kings
gold knight
we made a bargain remember
one dragon put down one bag of gold
your honor has a price
sir knight
it has expenses
honor wont feed my belly
nor shoe my horse
the priest is right
it is your duty to protect king einons
vassals as a knight of the realm
not of this realm
i bend no knee to einon
i should have known
foreign riffraff
well begone vagabond
before i arrest you
back to work you scum
if king einons wheat
isnt cut before the rain
ill do a little cutting
of my own
sir knight
sir knight wait
sir knight
hear me out
im on a pilgrimage
might we travel together
the roads still free
unless einons taxed it
a road tax king einon hmm
a road tax
they are your roads after all
people really ought to pay
for the privilege of using them
and those that cant pay will have to work it off
ingenious felton
only you could keep such a good brain
under such a bad hat
thats very good bad hat
out of my way peacock
brok some are good at hunting men
some are good at hunting money
both have value for me
kara
kara i told you
i told you not to come here anymore
im a disobedient child
go on take a drink go on
magnificent shot your highness
care to double the wager
ah yes happily
shall we say the water bucket
stand still stand still
superb
double again
double again why not
i say
a moving target
peasant scum
youve got a nerve
interfering with the kings sport
theres no sport in tormenting a sick old man
i beg your majesty
let him go
its been 12 years
your castle is built
he can do you no more harm
for gods sake release him
father
ive always said death is a release
not a punishment
go
kara
yoohoo
yoohoo
ive decided to compose
the ballad of bowen
how do you prefer i should write this
far away
oh dont concern yourself
with my safety
i mean verse meter
shall i spice it up
with a poetical flourish
or just the cold hard facts
if you do not be quiet
you and i shall be the only things
that are cold and hard around here
i mean its all very well to go
hacking and whacking at dragons
but if a dragon falls in the forest and
nobody gets to hear about it does it make a thud
brother gilbert
what
the quill is mightier than the s
ooh
the quill is mightier than the
thats all thats left
of the last dragonslayer
who tangled with me
if i were you
id quit while i was ahead
is that the best you can do
catch
you know ive got quite
a collection of victims in here
i wont be added to it
ive given you
my final warning
into the mouth of death he strode
into the gringy gloom
into the pit of fear unknown
perhaps to court his doom
that was good
what did i say
what did i say
a little damp for fire isnt it
why must you knighterrants
out to make a name for yourselves
always pick on us dragons
i dont need a name
and i have a collection of my own
yeah youre one
who kills dragons for money
its honest enough work
one must earn a living
oh yes one must live
well since you seek a profit
we might as well begin
oh dont flatter yourself
its not the profit
its the pleasure
perhaps less pleasurable
and more costly than you think
bowen bowen take care
he went that way
take care bowen
you cant fly forever
neither can you
slow down
come visit the woods
whoa
look out well done
ow
pity that must have hurt
yeah
again
ow
and again
how do you like the ride so far
were earning our money now
arent we
now is there somewhere you
would like me to drop you off
yikes
the sword against the fang and claw
the flame against the shield
blah blah blah
which one would win
blah blah
field shield wield
whose flesh from bones
be peeled oh no
whose fate would soon be sealed
whose fate would soon be sealed
whose fate would soon be sealed
oh youre good havent had
this sort of challenge in some time
nor likely to again
drat
a little overconfident arent we
hardly but if you win
youll be out of work
i will not stop until ive rid the world
of every last one of you
i am the last one
youre just trying to save
your scaly hide with tricks
havent you noticed the pickings
are rather slim these days
i got me one just the other day
so it was you who killed the scarred one
she and i were the last
mustve been a proud kill warrior
how much gold did her tattered carcass
put in your purse
thats none of your business
couldnt have been very much
and youll kill me for sport
and when there are
no more dragons to slay
how will you make
a living knight
shut up
whoa
if your teeth come down my sword
goes up right into your brain
if your sword goes up
my teeth come down
into the moonlit night
the titans dueled
in mortal combat bound
oh whod the fatal
false step make
whose blood
would stain the ground
oh good lord
sir eglamore
oh thank you very much
its been stuck down there
for months
can you get your buttocks
off my tongue
why should you be comfortable
my armor is rusting in your drool
and your breath is absolutely foul
well what do you expect
with old knights rotting
between my molars
oh god my mouth is so dry
no no no stop
no stop
sorry about that
it seems were in a bit of a stalemate
wouldnt you say
yuck but i can go
three days without sleep
i can go three weeks
ooh
ill stab you before i nod off
and ill chomp you
marvelous well kill each other
what do you suggest
a truce
get out of my mouth
and lets talk facetoface
how do i know i can trust you
i give you my word
the word of a dragon
its worthless
stubborn lout
i should have known
go on kill me
i dont want to kill you
i never did
and i dont want you to kill me
how do we gain
if you win you lose a trade
if i win i wait around
for the next sword slinger
thirsting to carve a reputation
out of my hide
and im tired of lurking in holes
and skulking in darkness
im gonna let you up now
and if you insist
we can pursue this fracas
to its final stupidity
or you can listen
to my alternative
hmm
whats the alternative
father father look
dragon
out of the way
out of the way
out of the way
pesky critters dragons
you
like big rats
you never seem to get rid of them
unless you pay me
two bags of gold in advance
come on dragon
come on dragon
yes
ow
hmm
hello
twentyeight twentynine
most profitable dragon
i should have met you a long time ago
there is much gold in the world
perhaps when youve had your fill of it
youll no longer need me
i am a knight of the old code
my word is my bond
no compunctions then
about what
well such deception hardly befits
a knight of the old code
fleecing einons lackeys
thats a service to mankind
is it
when you squeeze the nobility
its the peasants who feel the pinch
thats not my concern
why should i stick my neck out
for people afraid to risk their own
dont clutter up
a clever scheme with morality
mmm so be it
knight of the old code
if i wanted my conscience pricked
i would have stayed with the priest
huh and what does a dragon
know of the old code anyway
his blade defends the helpless
his might upholds the weak
his word speaks only truth
shut up i remember
thats all it is a memory
nothing can bring it back
you sound like one who tried
and failed
so i no longer try to change the world
dragon i just try to get by in it
yes its better than death
i suppose
oh is it i should think
youd welcome death
you know the last of your kind
all your friends dead
hunted wherever you go
do you delight in reminding me
yes knight
i do long for death
but fear it
why aside from your misery
whats to lose
my soul
finish him brok
well are you a man
should he continue mother
oh the field belongs to the apparently
inexhaustible sir brok my son
the quarry
first you beg mercy
for your fathers fate
then you try to avenge it
now youll share it
in your kingdom einon
there are worse fates than death
ill think one up for you
take her away
no no
he killed my father
he killed my father
he killed my father
i remember you now
i remember you
your hair like fire
you gave me this scar
didnt you
ioweyou
i can uh
i really can
sorry bowen
i hope you like it well done
you must have hated us very much
i hated one of you
these i killed because i wanted
to kill him but i never found him
i never will
if youre the last he must be dead
oh yes
tell me what was he like
this uh dragon
that you hated
he only had half a heart
but even that was enough
to pollute an innocent boy
einon was no innocent
he polluted the heart
how do you know that
how do you know that dragon
all dragons know that story
what was to be their hope
became their doom
a spoiled ungrateful child was given
a great gift and destroyed it
no i knew einon
i was his teacher
i taught him
the ways of honor of right
then he betrayed you
just as he betrayed
the dragon whose heart he broke
thats a lie dragon
stop calling me dragon
i have a name
well what is it
you couldnt possibly pronounce it
in your tongue
try me
its
next time stab more flesh
less cloth
ill pierce your heart
you already did
a very special heart
like no other
a black withered thing
without pity
then teach me
pity me
ill give you everything
even power
youre so beautiful
even power
even a throne
oh dear
thank you
its passed now
what was it
an old complaint
that acts up now and again
forgive me if anything
i said if i upset you
it wasnt you not you
dont be afraid
i wont let you suffer
the same fate as me
ive come to help you
this will bring you out
well below the castle walls
thank
you
have you been watching over me
all night
ive been thinking
yes about what
many things
mostly about what to call you
i think ive found you a name
you say that as though you reached up
and plucked it from the sky
i did
up there
do you see that group of stars
i know those stars very well
do you see the shape that they make
mmhmm a dragon
yes
they call it draco
it means dragon
in the scholars speech
so instead of calling me
dragon in your tongue
youll call me dragon
in some other tongue
youre right
its silly
no no i would be honored
to be named after those stars
ii truly would
thank you bowen
draco
throw off the yoke
of einons oppression
we must start to fight back
your father sang that sour tune once
and we did fight back
and once was enough
well not dance to it again
no hewe just cringe
like a dog under einons boot
at least a cringing dogs
a live one
hey why waste good food
on bad rhetoric
i speak the truth
truth
its rarely inspiring lass
and it never wins rebellions
but it will stretch necks
if there is a neck
underneath that little mud pie
ready or not here i come
dragon
its draco
about time
mmm
it seems you people
are in need of a dragonslayer
where is the lord responsible
for this village
brok lives in a big house
about six miles away
but hell only blame any damage on us
and pluck our pockets to pay for it
i wont pluck them as deeply
ill make you a fair offer
take it or leave him
its enough you people
grovel to einon
will you be bullied by some brokendown
blackmailing knight as well
thats right you dont need me
settle it yourself
of course there are other ways
perhaps youll part with
one of your precious daughters
instead of gold
dragons are partial
to maiden sacrifices i hear
dont do this
dont do this to me
i was born in this village
you knew my father
you knew my mother
whos the girl
a nuisance get rid of her
why
theyre trying to placate you with a sacrifice
now whoever gave them that bright idea
never mind just get rid of her
how
eat her
oh please yuck
arent we squeamish
you ate sir eglamore hypocrite
i merely chewed in selfdefense
but i never swallowed
improvise
all right all right
hes coming quick
you have a beautiful voice
oh thank you we dragons
love to sing when were happy
well youre not like a dragon at all
well how many dragons do you know
well youre the first
you should never listen
to minstrels fancies
a dragon would never hurt a soul
unless they tried to hurt him first
really
then why were you in my village
oh the village
yes the village
you remember the village
leave him alone you bully
run draco fly ill hold him
pick on someone your own size
where have you been
im truly sorry bowen
ive been distracted
bowen meet kara
you should have eaten her
oh dont get angry bowen
why not
you left me high and dry
i was worried to death
worried about me
yes about you
i had the whacker all set up
half the village is out there with me
were searching the skies for you
i dont know where you are
if youre coming back
when youre coming back you just
disappear
be careful
hes coming
well well well
it cant be
but it is
my old mentor
still giving carving lessons
get off your horse
ill give you one
times not been
kind to you bowen
you should never have broke with me
it was you who broke with me
and yet you return to me
with this girl i lost
i think she wants to stay lost
not her decision im afraid
im ready for my lesson now knight
thats one lesson you never learned
only expose your back to a corpse
you are a corpse
you just dont know it
lie down bowen
youre the sorry scrap
of dead worlds and dead beliefs
no they were your beliefs
never never mine
you said the words
you spoke them from your heart
i vomited them up
because i couldnt stomach them
because i knew it was
what you wanted to hear
lies liar
i taught you
you taught me to fight
thats all
i took what i needed from you
you taught me to fight
you taught me well
who asked you to interfere
i had everything under control
here let me see
its knitted well
you have a healers touch kara
in a few days
itll be just another scar
and whats one more scar
to a knight i mean
i once knew a knight
he stood all alone
against an evil king
and even saved a rebel leader
from blinding
he must have had many scars
that knight died of his wounds long ago
thats too bad
his kind is badly missed
in this world
thats the way the wretched world is girl
doesnt have to be
men like you could
could lead others
you could give people
courage and hope
hope even if you
could raise your army
do you think theyd stand a chance
against seasoned troops
last time they tried
it was a massacre
i remember i was there
so was i
that rebel was my father
let others stand with you youll see
this time the end will be different
what are you looking at
myself once upon a time
ill see you in the village draco
thats easy for you to say
this time ill collect the money
and you can die
we can lose no more pigs
to this dragon
wait
this man is a fraud
its her
this girl is a
wandering idiot
she babbles nonsense
im telling you
this knight is no dragonslayer
youre mistaken my child
hes the greatest dragonslayer
there is
possibly the greatest
there ever will be
brother gilbert
bowen
youre alive
praised be the saints
the saints be blessed
youre alive
and whole
brother gilbert
you could not put your trust
in a better man
i personally have seen him slay
almost two dragons
oh brother gilbert
almost
well i didnt actually see
the death blow of the second
but as bowen is here
he must have won
dont you see
hes in league with the dragon
hold that there
and here he comes
sink sink
i cant
it doesnt get any deeper
well done bowen
youve done it again
what a brute
thats even bigger than the last one
actually hes about the same size
meat
meat
meat meat
oh dear
run hes getting away
whats going on
meat
meat meat
meat
run thats whats going on
run
run
kara kara
peace brothers peace
heathens
brother gilbert
oh good lord
forgive me my child
liar liar
no dragon no charge
meat meat
meat meat
meat meat meat
were going to die
god help us
were all going to die
calm yourself brother gilbert
were not going to die
were just flying
if youre going
to get yourself killed
you might as well do it
in the fight against einon
i think kara has a point oh
but id rather discuss it
on the ground
draco what unholy place is this
unholy
this is avalon the resting place
of king arthur himself
so it was foretold
and so have i found you
brave king arthur
valor
virtue truth
ah yes truth
amen ready now kara
and you bowen
this is avalon
the shadow realm of the round table
its a divine omen
omens wont win battles
nor will you
and youll find out
when you try to raise your army
you already know
the courage in your village
theyre very brave at pelting
young girls with vegetables
it must start somewhere
will you wish us luck draco
long ago when man was young
and the dragon already old
the wisest of our race
took pity on man
he gathered together all the dragons
making them vow
to watch over man always
and at the moment of his death
the night became alive
with those stars
and thus was born
the dragons heaven
but when we die not all dragons
are admitted to this shining place
no we have to earn it
and if we dont
our spirit disappears
as if we never were
and thats why i shared my life force
with a dying boy
so i would reunite man and dragon
and ensure my place
among my ancient brothers of the sky
but my sacrifice
became my sin
it was you
your heart beats in einons breast
yes my halfheart
that cost me all of my soul
even then i knew
his bloodthirsty nature
but i thought my heart
could change him
my god i was so naive
no more than i
all my life ive dreamed
of serving noble kings
noble ideals
dreams die hard
and you hold them in your hands
long after theyve turned to dust
i will not be that naive again
kara i will go with you
so be it
farewell bowen
valor
valor
valor
a knight is sworn to valor
a knight is sworn to valor
a knight is sworn to valor
his heart knows only virtue
his heart knows only virtue
his blade defends the helpless
his blade defends the helpless
his might upholds the weak
his might upholds the weak
his word speaks only truth
his word speaks only truth
his wrath undoes the wicked
his wrath undoes the wicked
now i know youre completely mad
you want us to follow you
and a priest against einon
yes
to hell more like  but this time we can win
you dont understand
i dont want to understand
i understand this
i understand six years in a quarry
thats all i need to understand
believe me i know what youve
been through hewe
but this time weve been joined
only a fool would join you
youre not listening to what im saying
ive had enough
of your mischief
save your strength
for the fight against einon
there isnt any fight against einon
im going to start one
you and what army knight
you have never fired
a bow in your life
in anger or in practice
no
draw your bow
sight along the arrow
release
beginners luck
try again
steady
brother gilbert youre a natural
easy
here widen your stance
up down up down
one fluid stroke
this could cleave
a mans skull
like a pudding
eat
whoa whoa
i need more men
its just a few peasants waving pitchforks
i noticed theyre all on your land
youre not too busy hawking in your old
age to keep control of your minions are you
you acuse me
i was just saying that any one of us
is worth a hundred of them
my brave felton
an army unto himself
well
fool
i know this man who leads them
and i will not underestimate him
him or the dragon
dont be afraid of the dragon my son
im afraid of nothing
nothing
you understand
a mothers gift to her son
the finest to be had
the finest what
dragonslayers
have you thought beyond tomorrow
its hard to see that far
look at the camp
what do you see
what do you hear
hope
exactly
down there you have life
songs and courage
you have everything youll ever need
and now so do i
he dares defy me at my own gates
look at him
well today his code
dies once and for all
no

storm the castle

cold and wet and tired

who will go with me
come from the shadows aislinn
come where i can see you
you know why ive come
i know
in giving my heart ive taken on every
poison stirring in his evil breast
even the pain of his death
must be mine
you cannot blame yourself
death without immortality
that was not the only reason
i had to wait for a time when mankind
would not repeat my mistake
and let tyranny thrive
when there would be those
who remembered the onceways
remembered that even in the darkness
there is still light
i cannot see
are the stars shining tonight
brightly my lord
brightly
then let us end it
forgive me
i know why you brought me
the dragonslayers
you wanted them to kill him
because you wanted me dead
i wanted to correct
a mistake made years ago
when i saved a creature
not worth saving
how unmotherly of you
we have to open the gates
the rest of us are waiting outside
go save your dragon bowen
hurry all of you
its this way
well well well
what a pleasant surprise
i expected you bowen

bowen
lo im immortal
yeah
huh
now its you bowen
its you that has to do it
what are you talking about
as the heart binds einon to me in life
it binds us in death
thats not true
youve seen that it is
through the heart we share
each others pains and power
but in my half beats the life source
for einon to die i must die
einon is dead
he lives
it doesnt matter
dont you hear it
our rebels have stormed the castle
alive or dead einons beaten
weve won
you will never win until einons
evil is destroyed
and to do that
you must destroy me
once you swore your sword
and service were mine
to call when i had need of you
to ask what i would of you
i hold you to your vow knight
hes coming
coming to stop you
strike before its too late
you are the last

to the stars bowen
to the stars
and in the days following
dracos sacrifice
bowen and kara led the people
in a time of justice and brotherhood
as i remember it now
those were golden years
