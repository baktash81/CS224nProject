beekeepers sword swallowers
all of us
all the restless hearts
of the world
all trying
to find a way home
its hard to describe
what i felt like then
picture yourself walking
for days in a driving snow
you dont even know
youre walking in circles
the heaviness of your legs
in the drifts
your shouts
disappearing into the wind
how small you can feel
how far away home can be
home
the dictionary defines it
as both a place of origin
and a goal or destination
and the storm
the storm was all in my mind
or as the poet dante put it
in the middle of the journey of my life
i found myself in a dark wood
for i had lost
the right path
eventually i would find
the right path
but in the most unlikely place

my father died when i was nine
he was in the army
he wasnt home very much
two weeks before he died
he told me that
in the korean war
it felt like
hed lost his soul
all this time
i thought it was me
i moved seven times
in the last year
ive uh had several jobs
nothing seemed to fit
i dont seem to fit
and when your father died
how did that make you feel
i dont know
i was nine
it was like there was
this distinction suddenly
between you
and the rest of the world
i looked around me
life went on
just like it did before
but it wasnt
like it was before
my uncle helped
he would visit
he at least listened
and i thought
if i could light my own farts i could
fly to the moon or at least uranus
but if i couldnt do that at least
i could use my penis as a pogo stick
and that might be a way
of getting around
im sorry
yes thats good

i want to help people
last night with rudy
i connected to another human being
i want more of that
i want to learn about people
help them with their troubles
thats what i do
but you suck at it
you dont even look at people
when theyre talking
i want to listen
really listen to people
i cant allow you to leave i believe
you still have some issues to work out
ah well i dont need your permission
because i admitted myself
hunter
mmhmm
i must warn you
my report will read ama
that you were signed out of this
hospital against medical advice
and my report will read
idgara
i dont give a rats ass
and my name is patch
one morning
i woke up
i woke up
and i knew
you were really gone
a new day
a new way
and new eyes
would see the dawn
go your way
ill go mine
and carry on
hello
how you doin
how do you do
hey this is a nice room
may i help you
yeah i could really use
a foot massage right now
rephrasing
what are you doing here
im your new roommate
iim moving in
i dont mean to be rude
but arent you a little old
to be starting medical school
you know babe ruth was 39
when he joined the yankees
no he wasnt
youre right
but i could really use
an example like that and if
you ever find one let me know
hi patch adams
mitch vroman
georgetown university
i was awarded the william f thompson
scientific achievement award
mmm emerson elementary
i once drew a picture of a rabbit
that got me two gold stars
im gonna go
back over there now
whistling
man
first do no harm
what is implicit in this
simple precept of medicine
an awesome power
the power to do harm
who gives you this power
the patient
a patient will come to you
at his moment of greatest dread
hand you a knife and say
doctor cut me open
why
because he trusts you
he trusts you
the way a child trusts
he trusts you
to do no harm
the sad fact is
human beings
are not worthy of trust
it is human nature to lie
take shortcuts
to lose your nerve get tired
make mistakes
no rational patient would
put his trust in a human being
and were not gonna let him
it is our mission here
to rigorously and ruthlessly
train the humanity out of you
and make you
into something better
were gonna make doctors
out of you
bell rings
two years of studying
i thought wed have more contact
with patients didnt you
hi im patch
youve just experienced
a north american greeting
whereby one person offers
a verbal label to another
as an expression
of welcome and friendship
lesbian ballbuster
airhead leech
whichever one of these disgusts
you the most take your pick
well
please pass the word
i am not here to date i am not
here to flirt im here to study
laughs
thank you
i thought only i could repel women
with that kind of raw efficiency
well you just met your match
patch adams
truman schiff
nice to meet you truman
will you go out with me
you should see
what a lovely lovely world
it should be
may i ask you one question
do you buy everything
the dean was saying today
what do you mean
i mean that whole
drill sergeant thing
were gon make doctors
out of you medical scum
now drop down and give me 20
mmhmm
that whole marine thing
were not even gonna see
a patient until the third year
up until then
its just memorizing facts
why dont they just shove the book up
hamburger
right here on the colon thats where
its going anyway thanks very much
so why do you wanna be a doctor
i want to help
i want to connect with people
a doctor interacts with people
at their most vulnerable
he offers treatment
but he also offers counsel and hope
thats why i love the idea
of being a doctor
ive always been fascinated by
the development of the human mind
ah pumping neurons
we start out so open
and spontaneous
were real individuals then somewhere
along the way were drawn to conform
its as if were conditioned
by programmed responses
well thats true
but sometimes you can alter
the programmed response
just by changing some of the conditions
altering the parameters
let me show you
well call it
the hello experiment
the goal will be to break through
programmed response
by changing normal parameters
and getting a new emotional response
from the person
ready to enter data
hello
hi
wait
i dont get it
hi is a programmed response
i reached her
you scared her
no wait
wait for it
laughs
oh youre nuts
a smile
ten seconds
victory
theres more
come my friend
howdy
hi
see
response time is diminishing
yesterday i made
12 random phone calls
i talked to one man named dale for
three hours he told me amazing things
but what does this all prove
other than youre out of your mind
whats the difference between
a doctor and a scientist
and dont say salary
people hmm  we want to become doctors
because we want to help people
i want to be
a pediatrician
okay little people
the point is we have to treat
the patient as well as the disease
thats why we have to dive into people
wade into the sea of humanity truman

ive checked up on you hunter
patch
hunter dr prack was
a colleague of mine at bringham
he tells me
you have a brilliant mind
and like many brilliant people
you dont necessarily think
the rules apply to you
not all the rules sir but the golden
rule i think that applies to everyone
dont you sir
ive also heard you have
a real passion to be a doctor hunter
patch
truth of it is hunter
passion doesnt make doctors
i make doctors
understood
understood
good
medical students as a rule
have no contact with patients
until the third year
is that clear
it is sir but dont you think
is that clear
it is sir but dont you think
our way of doing things
is a product of centuries of experience
its all there for a reason
faint sirens people shouting
its my hospital
i know everything
that goes on inside of it
everything
truman
deviation of the tongue
woman
a problem with the cranial nerve
which side
right side tenth nerve
twelfth nerve
do you know how many billions of dollars
are wasted on malpractice insurance
thats money that goes to lawyers
that could go to patients
hi guys sorry im late
everybody know carin fisher
adelanes roommate
i invited her to join
our study group
so carin why do you
want to be a doctor
is it just me or do we
have a lot of work to do
its just a question
i think its the question
actually i dont find the question
here in the outline
what page are you on
uh 1432
deviation of a tongue
wed learn more if we were
working closely with patients
thats why were studying
to learn enough to help the patients
adelane dont waste your breath
dont you th
sighs
dont you think
i see through you
you act like youre above the system
when youre really just a nonconformist
you have to get
under the fingernails
of any authority figure
that crosses your path
as a way of dealing
with some insecurity
antisocial personality i believe
intriguing diagnosis
truman this isnt funny smart people
flunk out of here all the time
yeah uh odds are one of
the five of us sitting here actually
i have another question
in a perfect system
why are patients referred to
by their disease
as in that interesting
cancer patient
and not by their name
it certainly isnt to be mean
its to prevent transference
and why is that bad
and the one flunking out is
can we get back to the tongue
what if a doctor becomes
emotionally involved with a patient
does a doctor explode
no
who came up
with these rules
its against the hippocratic oath
i think
i dont really have time for this
sorry
bye
bye
sorry
charming
bye
truman
yeah
im sorry i didnt mean
to stop you from studying
go away
i believe theres more to being
a doctor than memorizing facts
about the ventricular artery
i dont care what you think
i care about my biology test
maybe i could help you
i read the bio book
the whole book
oh yeah
now im on to whitman
you can get leaves of grass
at the bookstore if you have
a 20 student id card
i dont want walt whitman
he wouldnt want you either
he was a homosexual
but thats not relevant whats relevant
is that he was a medical man
he was a nurse in the civil war
and wrote great poetry
afoot and lighthearted
i take to the open road
look im not sure
if youve noticed this
but in a class of 163 students
there are eight women eight
ive had to work really hard
to get here and im gonna have
to work even harder to stay
and im not about to blow it
by wasting my time on your
flighty theories of goodness
im here to learn about medicine
period
excuse me
i think somebody is
running away from something

oh forget about that i want to
show you something thats extraordinary
an enema bulb
it used to be
this amazing piece of rubber
when applied to your face
can brighten
another persons day

im sure its really great
for kids but
no not just kids anybody
patients are opening up
to me carin
theyre sharing their dreams
their fantasies
and if you hit on
the right topic
they brighten up
for one brief moment
they dont concentrate
on the pain
they dont even feel the pain
try it on

chuckles
ive always wanted
to be in a swimming pool
full of noodles
walltowall
and toptobottom
an entire pool
full of noodles
oh

laughing continues
oh  oh  i surrender
ill tell you what you want to know
do you wanna tell me what it is
you think youre doing
oh
uh
just getting
a few laughs sir
the american journal of medicine
has found that laughter
increases secretion
of catecholamines and endorphins
which in turn increases oxygenation
of the blood relaxes the arteries
speeds up the heart
decreases blood pressure
which has a positive effect
on all cardiovascular
and respiratory ailments
as well as overall increasing
the immune system response
clown shoes squeaking
smart clown eh
mr adams
when i told you
i knew dr prack
did i mislead you in some way
to think im a pushover like he is
kindly remove that coat
i told you you are not to see
the patients till the third year
im just visiting friends sir
why are you here
if you want to be a clown
go join the circus
patients dont need to be entertained
they dont need a friend
they need a doctor
i dont want to see you
in this hospital again
what if i visit the patients
on my own time
yes about your own time
its been brought to our attention
that perhaps we should be suspicious
of the level
of your grades
what are you saying
im cheating
your scores are among the top in
your class yet you never seem to study
thats ridiculous
your classmates
dont seem to think so
really who
im warning you
stay out of this hospital
you told walcott i cheated
i know you did it
just tell me why
look cut the crap hunter
i live with you i know how much
you study or dont study
and you do better than me
give me a break
you arrogant pompous prick
who appointed you custodian
of the medical profession
is it because your father
and his father was a doctor
some sort of genetic thing
youre damn right
really
i grew up with it
i know what it takes to look in the eyes
of dying people day after day
and come home
for dinner at night
i know what it takes
you dont have it
oh really and you do
if you dont like me
just say it
i dont like you
why dont you like me
youre a prick and i like you
because you make
my effort a joke
i want to be a doctor
this isnt a game to me
this isnt playtime
this is serious business
i have it in me
to be a great doctor
but in order to do that i have to
sacrifice if i want to be better
better
better than me hmm
sighs  i will save lives that
could have otherwise not been saved
now i could be like you and go around
laughing and have a good time ha ha
but i prefer to learn
because the more i learn
the more likely i will
have the right answer at the
crucial moment and save a life
and you say im a prick
you say im a prick
you know maybe i am
but you ask the average person when
death comes knocking at their door
whether they want a prick on their side
or some kindergarten teacher
whos gonna kiss their ass
because when that day comes
i want the prick
and so will you
you know i forget
how young you are mitch
that you think you have to be a prick
to get things done
and that you actually think
that thats a new idea
sighs
pen falls to desk
you know what i oughta do
take it to the state medical board
theres gotta be some constitutional
right for visiting the sick
why dont you
say anything
sorry patch
i think walcott
has a point
its a hospital
people are suffering
and dying
were all dying truman
our job is to increase health
you know what that means
that means improving the quality
of life not just delaying death
either way l
for your own sake i th i think you
should just lay low for a while
maybe youre right
preview of coming attractions
nurse
death to die to expire
to pass on to perish
to peg out to push up daisies
to push up posies
to peg out to push up daisies
to push up posies
to become extinct
curtains deceased demised
departed and defunct
dead as a doornail
dead as a herring
dead as a mutton
dead as nits
the last breath paying a debt
to nature the big sleep
gods way of saying
slow down
to check out
to shuffle off
this mortal coil
to head for
the happy hunting ground
to blink for an exceptionally long
period of time
to find oneself
without breath
to be the incredible decaying man
worm buffet
kick the bucket
buy the farm
take the cab
cash in your chips
and if we bury you ass up
we have a place to park my bike
whoo  comin out of chute number nine
ridin that morphine pony
whooaaah
come on now
hey yeah
lets check out the maternity ward
you know those chicks put out
here we see that the vitreous body
is composed of a transparent jelly
with a mesh
of collagen fibers
lights please
uh before we adjourn
dean walcott has a brief announcement
whispers
hes gonna have the sex change
next monday
the hospital is hosting
a medical
seminarslashretreat
for the fellowship of the
american college of gynecologists
whispers
ill get the strippers
it is important that they
be received in a manner suitable
to their status and position
i have traditionally selected
an outstanding student
to head
the welcoming committee
the time demands are great
and i wouldnt want to jeopardize
the academic performance
of a weaker student
this year i have chosen
hunter adams
students murmuring
oh well thank you
hunter
theres a detailed list
of instructions in my office
oh and uh the auditorium
could use a good cleaning
students laughing
bell rings
did you hear him  in a style according
to their stature and position
i am a great doctor
worship me  spread before me
who dares stand
you know what im thinking  maybe we
should decorate with a western motif
how about that
ah
something with stirrups
and a big banner that says
howdy gyneroos
dilated to meet ya
how about that
how about just doing it straight
what do you mean
as in straight to graduation
oh if anybody has a problem with this
please just walk away right now
chuckling
oh
all right
wow  yes
chuckling
okay
theyre right on time
good morning doctor
welcome to campus good to see you
how you doing doctor
uh gentlemen i believe that
youll find the facilities here
are just perfect
for your purposes today
we have everything set up
in the auditorium
if youd just follow me
students laughing
welcome coldhanded ones
its an honor
to greetslashwelcome
so many who have touched so many women
is such a powerful way
come on in
watch out
its a little slippery
and if you think
its hot out there whoa
come on
imitating echo
get him
in my office now
all right gentlemen
if uh ahem
if youd
just follow me
you wanted
to see me sir
you are dismissed
sir
from this school
kindly remove your things
and vacate the school premises
as soon as possible
what for
for asking a group of doctors to have
a sense of humor about themselves
oh i have a sense of humor hunter
i find it hilarious that
as smart as you are
you could give me an airtight reason
to throw you the hell out of here
why am i such a threat
to you sir
because what you want
is for us to get down there
on the same level as our patients
to destroy objectivity
all to uphold some
idealistic buddy system
that will allow you to work through
your own feelings of inadequacy
what you have done here today
is inexcusable
you have made a complete mockery
out of our distinguished guests
if you think that i will further
tolerate your blatant disregard
of the bylaws of this
what are you smiling at
is this all
a big joke to you
get out of here
door opens closes
man  blatant disregard for
school code and procedure
defying direct orders
from a dean
and i am aware
of your creative efforts
to make sure our visiting gynecologists
feel right at home
now what is it youd
like me to do for you
i want to graduate sir
dean walcott
thinks otherwise
but my grades
are way above par
i want to finish school
so i can become a doctor
well im gonna give this
to you real straight
i have a hospital and a medical school
to run here
i have to trust the people
in my employ
otherwise their quality of life
will turn to shit
their life turns to shit
my life turns to shit do you follow
yes
good
now uh dean walcott is a
groans  a pain in the ass
but i depend on him to keep me up to
speed on whats going on around here
and i would never take the word
of any student over his
however
i also have a source
that informs me that your antics
have improved the quality of life
for the patients
they dont complain as much
they take less medication
and uh whatshisname over in 305
has not thrown his bedpan at a nurse
in over a week
its bill
yeah whatever
so from now on you will not
enter that hospital
unless under the supervision of the
attendant as part of the curriculum
and you will steer clear
of dean walcott
yes sir
so im still in school
i wouldnt
send my laundry out
but uh you just
dont screw up huh

god youre being
so selfindulgent
this has been your vision
but we all built this place
and it belongs to all of us
carin will always remain
within these walls
if you walk away from that
if you let that all die
ive dedicated
every spare moment i have
to assisting you in what i believe
is a pure and a good purpose
quitting is not going
to help you get through this
youve always told us
stop it
ive always told you what
people are good
trust people  ha
you know truman
in all of gods creations only
human beings kill their own species
theres a fun fact
for your final exam
carins death cannot make
helping people wrong
she saw it coming
she knew there was something dangerous
about larry i didnt see it
patch
why are you being like this
because i killed her
truman
i taught her the medicine
that killed her
shed still be here
if i hadnt met her
squeaking
you cant leave
if what you say is true looks like
im defying the laws of possibility
what are you doing
oh i cant leave
until you beat me is that it
okay i surrender
youre number one
youre the top student in the class
youre smarter than me
is that what you want to hear
now can i leave
you know mrs kennedy
in 212
she doesnt eat
i visited her room every day
for the last three weeks
i cant get her to eat
now i know everything
there is to know about medicine
ive studied relentlessly
i guarantee you i can outdo
outdiagnose any attending
and surgeon in this hospital
sighs
but i cant make her eat
you have a gift
you have a way with people
you know they like you
and if you leave
i cant learn this way
sighs
so what now huh
what do you want from me
yeah i could do it
we both know
you wouldnt stop me
so answer me please
tell me what youre doing
okay
lets look at the logic
you create man
man suffers enormous amounts
of pain
man dies
maybe you should have had just
a few more brainstorming sessions
prior to creation
you rested
on the seventh day
maybe you should have spent
that day on compassion
scoffs
you know what
youre not worth it
laughs
laughing
do you still want help
with mrs kennedy
door opens
hey aggie

surprise for you

aggie  aggie
grab ahold aggie
there you go
oh
oh
come on in aggie
yyes
laughing
laughing continues
yelling
patch
pasta angels aggie  pasta angels
patch
hey im supposed
to give you this
paper crumbling
you turn around
and walk right out of here
why
everything will be delineated
in your letter of dismissal
why
you dont fit in
there are standards
and codes
you make the patients and everyone else
around you uncomfortable
i make you uncomfortable
well you can make this into
a personal issue if youd like
but the reality is
you are not cut out to be a physician
and it is my responsibility
responsibility
you have one responsibility to be
a dickhead how hard can that be
all you have to do is make sure
your head is a dick
and its attached to your neck
you leave immediately
i wanna see my records
theyre confidential
only the staff
please
you have to have permission
you cant just go in there
and take your own file
truman
your marks are basically perfect
youve gotta be near
the top of the class
look at this
excessive happiness
actually says
youre excessively happy
mmhmm
and what does that mean
isnt that good
i gotta fight this
what can we do
dean walcott seems thoroughly committed
to your not ever becoming a doctor
even dean anderson
signed this
softly
nah im screwed
mitch  i like this
locker opens
you need my help
i prefer to think
im using you
you have one shot
mmhmm
youd have to appeal
to the state medical board
how does that work
you claim that a prejudice
and injustice has occurred
theyll be worried about a suit
theyll have to investigate
then what
theyll review your grades
which is good
mmhmm
youre almost
top of the class
but mostly your behavior
do you have any idea
what walcott has on you
howd you get these
dont ask
they cant prevent me
from graduating because of
a personality clash can they
hunter this is a medical institution
youre dealing with
they draw their own law
youll have to get their focus
on your high marks and off of this
im screwed arent i
youre almost a doctor
theyre a panel of doctors
just think of them as your peers
and return these
softly
yeah
and get a suit
murmuring
murmuring
man
hunter adams
youve been accused of
practicing medicine without a license
thats a very
grave charge son
are you aware that its unlawful
to practice medicine without
a medical license
yes sir i am
are you aware that running a medical
clinic without the proper licensing
can place both you
and the public
in a great deal of danger
is a home a clinic sir
if you are admitting patients
and treating them
physical location
is irrelevant
sir will you define
treatment for me
yes treatment would be defined
as the care of a patient
seeking medical attention
have you been treating patients
mr adams
i live with several people
they come and go as they please
i offer them
whatever help i can
mr adams
have you or have you not
been treating patients at your ranch
everyone who comes to the ranch
is a patient yes
murmuring
and every person who comes
to the ranch is also a doctor
im sorry
every person who comes
to the ranch is in need
of some form of physical
or mental help
theyre patients
but also every person who comes
to the ranch is in charge of
taking care of someone else
whether its cooking for them
cleaning them
or even as simple a task
as listening
that makes them doctors
i use that term broadly but is not a
doctor someone who helps someone else
when did the term doctor get
treated with such reverence as
right this way doctor smith
or excuse me dr scholl
what wonderful footpads
or pardon me dr patterson
but your flatulence has no odor
laughing murmuring
at what point in history
did a doctor become more
than a trusted and learned friend
who visited and treated the ill
now you ask me if
ive been practicing medicine
well if this means opening
your door to those in need
those in pain
caring for them listening
to them applying a cold cloth
until a fever breaks
if this is practicing medicine
if this is treating a patient
then i am guilty
as charged sir
did you consider the ramifications
of your actions
what if one of your patients
had died
whats wrong
with death sir
what are we so mortally
afraid of
why cant we treat death with
a certain amount of humanity
and dignity and decency
and god forbid
maybe even humor
death is not the enemy
gentlemen
if were gonna fight a disease
lets fight one of the most
terrible diseases of all
indifference
now ive sat in your schools and heard
people lecture on transference
and professional distance
transference
is inevitable sir
every human being
has an impact on another
why dont we want that in
a patientdoctor relationship
thats why ive listened to your
teachings and i believe theyre wrong
a doctors mission should be
not just to prevent death
but also to improve
the quality of life
thats why you treat a disease
you win you lose
you treat a person i guarantee you
you win no matter what the outcome
now here today this room
is full of medical students
dont let them anesthetize you
dont let them numb you out
to the miracle of life
always live in awe of the
glorious mechanism of the human body
let that be the focus of your studies
and not a quest for grades
whichll give you no idea what kind
of doctor you will become
man
please try and address the board
dont wait till youre on the ward
to get your humanity back
start your interviewing skills
start talking to strangers
talk to your friends
talk to wrong numbers everyone
mr adams
and cultivate friendships
with those amazing people in the back of
the room nurses that could teach you
theyve been with people every day
they wade through blood and shit
they have a wealth of knowledge
and so do the professors you respect
the ones who are not dead
from the heart up
share their compassion
let that be contagious
mr adams
i demand that you turn
and address the board
sir i want to be a doctor
with all my heart
i wanted to become a doctor
so i could serve others
and because of that
ive lost everything
but ive also
gained everything
ive shared the lives of patients
and staff members at the hospital
ive laughed with them
ive cried with them
this is what i want to do
with my life
and as god is my witness
no matter what your decision
today sir
i will still become the best damn doctor
the world has ever seen
now you have the ability
to prevent me from graduating
you can keep me from getting
the title and the white coat
but you cant control
my spirit gentlemen
you cant keep me from learning
you cant keep me from studying
so you have a choice you could
have me as a professional colleague
passionate
or you can have me as an
outspoken outsider still adamant
either way ill probably
still be viewed as a thorn
but i promise you one thing
i am a thorn
that will not go away
is that all
i hope not sir
we will adjourn briefly
chuckles
laughs
thank you

hunter adams
sighs  we find your methods
less than appealing
your appearance and your demeanor
do not reflect
what we believe
is necessary
to earn a patients trust
and respect
you openly accuse us of adhering
to timehonored practices
that for years have been the backbone
of the entire medical institution
however
we find no fault
in your attempts
to improve the quality of life
around you
we find no fault
in your desire
to expand upon existing
medical practices
and theories
we applaud your love
of the patient
your grades are among
the highest in your class
and therefore we find
no merit in the decision
to block your graduation
from medical school
now along with your crass
and disdainful behavior
you carry with you a flame
which one could only hope
would spread through
the medical profession like a brushfire
and uh dean walcott
in the future
i think matters like this
could best be solved if you yourself
would practice a little
excessive happiness
well today you go
from being students in a class
to being members of a class
a very select class
you face the future
with your heads held high
because you are now
doctors
