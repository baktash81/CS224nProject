beekeepers  sword swallowers  
all of us 
all the restless hearts
of the world   
all trying
to find a way home 
it s hard to describe
what i felt like then 
picture yourself walking
for days in a driving snow 
you don t even know
you re walking in circles  
the heaviness of your legs
in the drifts 
your shouts
disappearing into the wind 
how small you can feel 
how far away home can be 
home 
the dictionary defines it
as both a place of origin   
and a goal or destination 
and the storm  
the storm was all in my mind 
or  as the poet dante put it   
 in the middle of the journey of my life
i found myself in a dark wood   
for i had lost
the right path  
eventually i would find
the right path   
but in the most unlikely place

my father died when i was nine 
he was in the army 
he wasn t home very much 
two weeks before he died   
he told me that
in the korean war   
it felt like
he d lost his soul 
all this time
i thought it was me 
i moved seven times
in the last year 
i ve  uh  had several jobs 
nothing seemed to fit 
i don t seem to fit 
and when your father died 
how did that make you feel  
i don t know 
i was nine 
it was like there was
this distinction  suddenly   
between you
and the rest of the world 
i looked around me 
life went on
just like it did before 
but it wasn t
like it was before 
my uncle helped 
he would visit 
he at least listened 
and i thought   
if i could light my own farts i could
fly to the moon  or at least uranus 
but if i couldn t do that at least
i could use my penis as a pogo stick   
and that might be a way
of getting around 
i m sorry  
yes  that s good

w why are we meeting in here  
it s cramped 
well  everton  we re meeting in here
so that rudy can participate 
  it s cramped 
  does anyone else
have a thought on that  
  cramped  
  i think he has a question 
  patients laughing

making fun of a man s infirmity  
maybe he does have a question 
he s alive 
  he s catatonic 
  well  he still has a brain 
  maybe he wants to participate too 
    rudy   yeah 
maybe he has a question 
yeah  maybe

  laughing  
  laughing continues  
maybe beany knows a lot more

collateral ligaments

is that it

each day 
ah  the truth is 
you re well on the way 
if you didn t
see something here   
besides a crazy 
bitter old man

mmm

i d like to leave 
hunter  we ll have to discuss this
at your scheduled time 
i m leaving 
have you thought
about what you ll do  
i want to help people 
last night with rudy 
i connected to another human being 
i want more of that 
i want to learn about people 
help them with their troubles 
  that s what i do 
  but you suck at it 
you don t even look at people
when they re talking 
i want to listen 
really listen to people 
i can t allow you to leave  i believe
you still have some issues to work out 
ah  well  i don t need your permission
because i admitted myself 
  hunter 
  mm hmm  
i must warn you
my report will read  a m a    
that you were signed out of this
hospital  against medical advice  
and my report will read
 i d g a r a  
 i don t give a rat s ass  
and my name is patch 
one morning
i woke up
i woke up
and i knew
you were really gone
a new day
a new way
and new eyes
would see the dawn
go your way
i ll go mine
and carry on
hello 
how you doin   
how do you do  
hey  this is a nice room 
  may i help you  
  yeah  i could really use
a foot massage right now 
rephrasing 
what are you doing here  
i m your new roommate 
i i m moving in 
i don t mean to be rude 
but aren t you a little old
to be starting medical school  
you know  babe ruth was 39
when he joined the yankees 
  no  he wasn t 
  you re right 
but i could really use
an example like that  and if
you ever find one  let me know 
hi  patch adams 
mitch vroman 
georgetown university 
i was awarded the william f  thompson
scientific achievement award 
mmm  emerson elementary 
i once drew a picture of a rabbit
that got me two gold stars 
i m gonna go
back over there now 
  whistling  
  man  
first do no harm 
what is implicit in this
simple precept of medicine  
an awesome power 
the power to do harm 
who gives you this power  
the patient 
a patient will come to you
at his moment of greatest dread  
hand you a knife and say 
 doctor  cut me open  
why  
because he trusts you 
he trusts you
the way a child trusts 
he trusts you
to do no harm 
the sad fact is   
human beings
are not worthy of trust 
it is human nature to lie   
take shortcuts 
to lose your nerve  get tired   
make mistakes 
no rational patient would
put his trust in a human being   
and were not gonna let him  
it is our mission here   
to rigorously and ruthlessly
train the humanity out of you   
and make you
into something better 
we re gonna make doctors
out of you 
  bell rings  
two years of studying 
i thought we d have more contact
with patients  didn t you  
hi  i m patch 
you ve just experienced
a north american greeting   
whereby one person offers
a verbal label to another   
as an expression
of welcome and friendship 
lesbian  ball buster 
airhead  leech 
whichever one of these disgusts
you the most  take your pick 
  well  
  please pass the word 
i am not here to date  i am not
here to flirt  i m here to study 
  laughs  
thank you 
i thought only i could repel women
with that kind of raw efficiency 
well  you just met your match 
  patch adams 
  truman schiff 
nice to meet you  truman 
will you go out with me  
you should see
   what a lovely  lovely world
it should be
  may i ask you one question  
  do you buy everything
the dean was saying today  
  what do you mean  
i mean  that whole
drill sergeant thing 
 we re gon  make doctors
out of you medical scum 
  now drop down and give me 20  
  mm hmm 
that whole marine thing 
we re not even gonna see
a patient until the third year 
up until then 
it s just memorizing facts 
 why don t they just shove the book up  
 hamburger  
right here on the colon  that s where
it s going anyway  thanks very much 
  so  why do you wanna be a doctor  
  i want to help 
i want to connect with people 
a doctor interacts with people
at their most vulnerable 
he offers treatment 
but he also offers counsel and hope 
that s why i love the idea
of being a doctor 
i ve always been fascinated by
the development of the human mind 
ah  pumping neurons 
we start out so open
and spontaneous 
we re real individuals  then somewhere
along the way we re drawn to conform 
  it s as if we re conditioned
by programmed responses 
  well  that s true 
but sometimes you can alter
the programmed response   
just by changing some of the conditions 
altering the parameters 
let me show you 
we ll call it
the  hello  experiment 
the goal will be to break through
programmed response   
by changing normal parameters   
and getting a new emotional response
from the person 
ready to enter data 
hello 
hi 
wait 
i don t get it 
 hi  is a programmed response 
  i reached her 
  you scared her 
no  wait 
wait for it 
  laughs  
oh  you re nuts 
a smile 
ten seconds 
victory 
there s more 
come  my friend 
  howdy  
  hi 
see  
response time is diminishing 
yesterday i made
12 random phone calls 
i talked to one man named dale for
three hours  he told me amazing things 
but what does this all prove 
other than you re out of your mind  
what s the difference between
a doctor and a scientist  
and don t say salary 
people  hmm   we want to become doctors
because we want to help people 
i want to be
a pediatrician 
okay  little people 
the point is  we have to treat
the patient as well as the disease 
that s why we have to dive into people 
wade into the sea of humanity  truman

  i ve checked up on you  hunter 
  patch 
hunter  dr  prack was
a colleague of mine at bringham 
he tells me
you have a brilliant mind   
and  like many brilliant people 
you don t necessarily think
the rules apply to you 
not all the rules  sir  but the golden
rule  i think that applies to everyone 
don t you  sir  
i ve also heard you have
a real passion to be a doctor  hunter 
patch 
truth of it is  hunter 
passion doesn t make doctors 
i make doctors 
understood  
  understood 
  good 
medical students  as a rule 
have no contact with patients
until the third year 
  is that clear  
  it is  sir  but don t you think  
  is that clear  
  it is  sir  but don t you think  
our way of doing things
is a product of centuries of experience 
it s all there for a reason 
  faint sirens  people shouting  
it s my hospital 
i know everything
that goes on inside of it 
everything 
  truman  
deviation of the tongue 
    woman  
a problem with the cranial nerve 
  which side  
  right side  tenth nerve 
  twelfth nerve 
do you know how many billions of dollars
are wasted on malpractice insurance  
that s money that goes to lawyers
that could go to patients 
  hi  guys  sorry i m late 
  everybody know carin fisher 
adelane s roommate  
i invited her to join
our study group 
so  carin  why do you
want to be a doctor  
is it just me  or do we
have a lot of work to do  
it s just a question 
i think it s the question 
actually  i don t find the question
here in the outline 
  what page are you on  
  uh  1432 
deviation of a tongue 
we d learn more if we were
working closely with patients 
that s why we re studying  
to learn enough to help the patients 
adelane  don t waste your breath 
don t you th  
  sighs  
don t you think
i see through you  
you act like you re above the system
when you re really just a nonconformist 
you have to get
under the fingernails   
of any authority figure
that crosses your path   
as a way of dealing
with some insecurity 
antisocial personality  i believe 
intriguing diagnosis 
truman  this isn t funny  smart people
flunk out of here all the time 
yeah  uh  odds are one of
the five of us sitting here  actually 
i have another question 
in a perfect system   
why are patients referred to
by their disease   
as in  that interesting
cancer patient  
and not by their name  
  it certainly isn t to be mean 
it s to prevent transference 
  and why is that bad  
  and the one flunking out is  
  can we get back to the tongue  
what if a doctor becomes
emotionally involved with a patient  
does a doctor explode  
no 
who came up
with these rules  
it s against the hippocratic oath 
i think 
i don t really have time for this 
sorry 
bye 
  bye 
  sorry 
  charming 
  bye 
  truman  
  yeah 
  i m sorry  i didn t mean
to stop you from studying 
  go away  
i believe there s more to being
a doctor than memorizing facts
about the ventricular artery 
i don t care what you think 
i care about my biology test 
  maybe i could help you 
i read the bio book 
  the whole book  
oh  yeah 
now i m on to whitman 
you can get leaves of grass
at the bookstore if you have
a 20  student i d  card 
  i don t want walt whitman 
  he wouldn t want you either 
he was a homosexual 
but that s not relevant  what s relevant
is that he was a medical man 
he was a nurse in the civil war
and wrote great poetry 
 afoot and lighthearted 
i take to the open road   
look  i m not sure
if you ve noticed this   
but in a class of 163 students
there are eight women   eight 
i ve had to work really hard
to get here  and i m gonna have
to work even harder to stay   
and i m not about to blow it
by wasting my time on your
flighty theories of goodness 
i m here to learn about medicine 
period 
excuse me 
i think somebody is
running away from something 
why can t it just be that
i m running away from you

oh 
uh   
just getting
a few laughs  sir 
the american journal of medicine
has found that laughter   
increases secretion
of catecholamines and endorphins   
which in turn increases oxygenation
of the blood  relaxes the arteries   
speeds up the heart 
decreases blood pressure   
which has a positive effect
on all cardiovascular
and respiratory ailments   
as well as overall increasing
the immune system response 
  clown shoes squeaking  
smart clown  eh  
mr  adams 
when i told you
i knew dr  prack   
did i mislead you in some way
to think i m a pushover  like he is  
kindly remove that coat 
i told you you are not to see
the patients till the third year 
i m just visiting friends  sir 
why are you here  
if you want to be a clown 
go join the circus 
patients don t need to be entertained 
they don t need a friend 
they need a doctor 
i don t want to see you
in this hospital again 
what if i visit the patients
on my own time  
yes  about your own time 
it s been brought to our attention
that perhaps we should be suspicious   
of the level
of your grades 
what are you saying  
i m cheating  
your scores are among the top in
your class  yet you never seem to study 
that s ridiculous 
your classmates
don t seem to think so 
really  who  
i m warning you 
stay out of this hospital 
you told walcott i cheated 
i know you did it 
just tell me why 
look  cut the crap  hunter 
i live with you  i know how much
you study  or don t study 
and you do better than me  
give me a break 
you arrogant  pompous prick  
who appointed you custodian
of the medical profession  
is it because your father
and his father was a doctor 
some sort of genetic thing  
  you re damn right 
  really  
i grew up with it 
i know what it takes to look in the eyes
of dying people day after day   
and come home
for dinner at night 
  i know what it takes 
you don t have it 
  oh  really  and you do  
if you don t like me 
just say it 
i don t like you  
why don t you like me  
you re a prick  and i like you 
because you make
my effort a joke  
i want to be a doctor  
this isn t a game to me  
this isn t playtime  
this is serious business  
i have it in me
to be a great doctor   
but in order to do that i have to
sacrifice if i want to be better 
 better  
better than me  hmm  
  sighs   i will save lives that
could have otherwise not been saved 
now  i could be like you and go around
laughing and have a good time  ha ha 
but i prefer to learn 
because the more i learn 
the more likely i will
have the right answer at the
crucial moment and save a life 
and you say i m a prick  
you say i m a prick  
you know  maybe i am 
but you ask the average person  when
death comes knocking at their door   
whether they want a prick on their side
or some kindergarten teacher   
who s gonna kiss their ass  
because when that day comes
i want the prick   
and so will you 
you know  i forget
how young you are  mitch   
that you think you have to be a prick
to get things done   
and that you actually think
that that s a new idea 
  sighs  
  pen falls to desk  
you know what i oughta do  
take it to the state medical board 
there s gotta be some constitutional
right for visiting the sick 
why don t you
say anything  
sorry  patch 
i think walcott
has a point 
it s a hospital 
people are suffering
and dying 
we re all dying  truman 
our job is to increase health 
you know what that means  
that means improving the quality
of life  not just delaying death 
either way  l  
for your own sake  i th   i think you
should just lay low for a while 
maybe you re right 
preview of coming attractions 
nurse 
 death  to die  to expire 
to pass on  to perish  
to peg out  to push up daisies 
to push up posies 
to peg out  to push up daisies 
to push up posies 
to become extinct 
curtains  deceased  demised 
departed and defunct 
dead as a doornail 
dead as a herring 
dead as a mutton 
dead as nits 
the last breath  paying a debt
to nature  the big sleep 
god s way of saying 
 slow down  
to check out 
to shuffle off
this mortal coil 
to head for
the happy hunting ground

period of time 
to find oneself

is composed of a transparent jelly   
with a mesh
of collagen fibers 
lights  please 
uh  before we adjourn
dean walcott has a brief announcement 
  whispers  
he s gonna have the sex change  
next monday
the hospital is hosting   
a medical
seminar slash retreat   
for the fellowship of the
american college of gynecologists 
  whispers  
i ll get the strippers 
it is important that they
be received in a manner suitable
to their status and position 
i have traditionally selected
an outstanding student   
to head
the welcoming committee 
the time demands are great 
and i wouldn t want to jeopardize   
the academic performance
of a weaker student 
this year i have chosen   
hunter adams 
    students murmuring  
  oh  well  thank you 
hunter   
there s a detailed list
of instructions in my office 
oh  and  uh  the auditorium
could use a good cleaning 
    students laughing  
    bell rings  
did you hear him    in a style according
to their stature and position  
 i am a great doctor  
worship me   spread before me  
who dares stand   
you know what i m thinking   maybe we
should decorate with a western motif 
how about that  
ah 
something with stirrups
and a big banner that says   
 howdy  gyneroos  
dilated to meet ya   
  how about that  
  how about just doing it straight  
  what do you mean  
  as in  straight to graduation 
oh  if anybody has a problem with this 
please  just walk away right now 
  chuckling  
oh 
all right 
wow   yes  
  chuckling  
okay 
they re right on time 
good morning  doctor 
welcome to campus  good to see you 
how you doing  doctor  
uh  gentlemen  i believe that
you ll find the facilities here   
are just perfect
for your purposes today 
we have everything set up
in the auditorium 
if you d just follow me  
  students laughing  
welcome  cold handed ones 
it s an honor
to greet slash welcome   
so many who have touched so many women
is such a powerful way 
come on in 
watch out 
it s a little slippery 
and if you think
it s hot out there   whoa  
come on  
  imitating echo  
get him
in my office now 
all right  gentlemen 
if  uh   ahem  
if you d
just follow me 
you wanted
to see me  sir  
you are dismissed 
sir 
from this school 
kindly remove your things   
and vacate the school premises
as soon as possible 
what for  
for asking a group of doctors to have
a sense of humor about themselves  
oh  i have a sense of humor  hunter 
i find it hilarious that 
as smart as you are   
you could give me an airtight reason
to throw you the hell out of here  
why am i such a threat
to you  sir  
because what you want
is for us to get down there
on the same level as our patients   
to destroy objectivity   
all to uphold some
idealistic buddy system   
that will allow you to work through
your own feelings of inadequacy 
what you have done here today   
is inexcusable 
you have made a complete mockery
out of our distinguished guests 
if you think that i will further
tolerate your blatant disregard
of the bylaws of this  
what are you smiling at  
is this all
a big joke to you  
get out of here  
  door opens  closes  
  man   blatant disregard for
school code and procedure 
defying direct orders
from a dean 
and i am aware
of your creative efforts   
to make sure our visiting gynecologists
feel right at home 
  now  what is it you d
like me to do for you  
  i want to graduate  sir 
dean walcott
thinks otherwise   
but my grades
are way above par 
i want to finish school
so i can become a doctor 
well  i m gonna give this
to you real straight 
i have a hospital and a medical school
to run here 
i have to trust the people
in my employ   
otherwise their quality of life
will turn to shit 
their life turns to shit 
my life turns to shit  do you follow  
  yes 
  good 
now  uh  dean walcott is a  
  groans   a pain in the ass   
but i depend on him to keep me up to
speed on what s going on around here   
and i would never take the word
of any student over his 
however   
i also have a source
that informs me that your antics   
have improved the quality of life
for the patients 
they don t complain as much 
they take less medication   
and  uh  what s his name over in 305
has not thrown his bedpan at a nurse   
in over a week 
  it s bill 
  yeah  whatever 
so  from now on you will not
enter that hospital   
unless under the supervision of the
attendant  as part of the curriculum   
and you will steer clear
of dean walcott 
yes  sir 
so i m still in school  
i wouldn t
send my laundry out   
but  uh  you just
don t screw up  huh  
  rock

i really helped some of them 
it was an incredible
feeling  carin 
there was one patient
named rudy

my entire life

attracted to me 
my entire life 
when i was a little girl   
i would look out my bedroom window
at the caterpillars 
i envied them so much 
no matter
what they were before   
no matter   
what happened to them   
they could just hide away 
you know   
and turn into these beautiful
creatures that could fly away   
completely untouched 
i hated men so much 
i wanted nothing
to do with them 
  sniffles

we have no iodine  we don t even

  oh  no  walcott found out
about our borrowed supplies

ye of little faith 
  sighs  
dean anderson  i know what this is
all about  and i assure you  sir  
sit down 
  clears throat  
something happened last night 
carin fisher was murdered 
she was with lawrence silver 
there was a shotgun involved 
and then he turned the gun on himself 
jesus christ  patch  i m sorry 
i know she was a friend 
if there s  um 
anything i can do  
hell of a deal 
  minister  
 into your hands  o merciful savior   
we commend
your servant carin 
receive her into the arms
of your mercy 
into the blessed rest
of everlasting peace 
and into the glorious company
of the saints    on high  
  amen 
    sobbing

i love you straightforwardly 
without complexities or pride 
i love you because i know
no other way than this 
  sniffles  
so close   
that your hand on my chest
is my hand 
so close
that when you close your eyes   
i fall asleep  
  sobbing  
i m sorry  honey   i m sorry  
we can t disband 
you know that  right  
what about our patients  
what do we tell them  
they ll manage 
they managed before 
  i refuse to quit 
  good 
god  you re being
so self indulgent 
this has been your vision 
but we all built this place
and it belongs to all of us 
carin will always remain
within these walls 
if you walk away from that 
if you let that all die  
i ve dedicated
every spare moment i have   
to assisting you in what i believe
is a pure and a good purpose 
quitting is not going
to help you get through this 
  you ve always told us  
  stop it  
i ve always told you what  
people are good 
trust people   ha  
you know  truman   
in all of god s creations  only
human beings kill their own species 
there s a fun fact
for your final exam 
carin s death cannot make
helping people wrong 
she saw it coming 
she knew there was something dangerous
about larry  i didn t see it 
patch 
why are you being like this  
because i killed her 
truman 
i taught her the medicine
that killed her 
she d still be here
if i hadn t met her 
  squeaking  
you can t leave 
if what you say is true  looks like
i m defying the laws of possibility 
what are you doing  
oh  i can t leave
until you beat me  is that it  
okay  i surrender 
you re number one 
you re the top student in the class 
you re smarter than me 
is that what you want to hear  
now can i leave  
you know mrs  kennedy
in 212  
she doesn t eat 
i visited her room every day
for the last three weeks 
i can t get her to eat 
now  i know everything
there is to know about medicine 
i ve studied relentlessly 
i guarantee you i can outdo 
out diagnose any attending
and surgeon in this hospital 
  sighs  
but i can t make her eat 
you have a gift 
you have a way with people 
you know  they like you 
and if you leave 
i can t learn this way 
  sighs  
so what now  huh  
what do you want from me  
yeah  i could do it 
we both know
you wouldn t stop me 
so answer me  please 
tell me what you re doing 
okay 
let s look at the logic 
you create man 
man suffers enormous amounts
of pain 
man dies 
maybe you should have had just
a few more brainstorming sessions   
prior to creation 
you rested
on the seventh day 
maybe you should have spent
that day on compassion 
  scoffs  
you know what  
you re not worth it 
  laughs  
  laughing  
do you still want help
with mrs  kennedy  
  door opens  
hey  aggie 
we have a special
surprise for you 
  chattering  hooting  
surprise  
  shouting  
benvenuto  aggie  
  patch  
aggie   aggie  
grab ahold  aggie  
there you go 
oh  
  oh 
  come on in  aggie  
y yes 
  laughing  
    laughing continues  
    yelling  
  patch  
pasta angels  aggie   pasta angels  
patch  
hey  i m supposed
to give you this 
  paper crumbling  
  you turn around
and walk right out of here 
  why  
everything will be delineated
in your letter of dismissal 
  why  
  you don t fit in 
there are standards
and codes 
you make the patients and everyone else
around you uncomfortable 
  i make you uncomfortable 
  well  you can make this into
a personal issue if you d like 
but the reality is 
you are not cut out to be a physician 
  and it is my responsibility  
  responsibility  
you have one responsibility   to be
a dick head  how hard can that be  
all you have to do is make sure
your head is a dick
and it s attached to your neck 
  you leave immediately 
  i wanna see my records 
they re confidential 
only the staff  
please 
you have to have permission 
you can t just go in there
and take your own file  
  truman  
your marks are basically perfect 
you ve gotta be near
the top of the class 
look at this 
 excessive happiness  
  actually says
you re excessively happy  
  mm hmm 
and what does that mean  
isn t that good  
  i gotta fight this 
  what can we do  
dean walcott seems thoroughly committed
to your not ever becoming a doctor 
even dean anderson
signed this 
  softly  
nah  i m screwed 
    mitch   i like this 
    locker opens  
you need my help 
i prefer to think
i m using you 
  you have one shot 
  mm hmm 
  you d have to appeal
to the state medical board 
  how does that work  
you claim that a prejudice
and injustice has occurred 
  they ll be worried about a suit 
they ll have to investigate 
  then what  
  they ll review your grades 
which is good  
  mm hmm 
you re almost
top of the class  
but mostly your behavior 
do you have any idea
what walcott has on you  
how d you get these  
don t ask 
they can t prevent me
from graduating because of
a personality clash  can they  
hunter  this is a medical institution
you re dealing with 
they draw their own law 
you ll have to get their focus
on your high marks and off of this 
i m screwed  aren t i  
you re almost a doctor 
they re a panel of doctors 
just think of them as your peers   
and return these 
  softly  
yeah 
and get a suit 
  murmuring  
  murmuring  
  man  
hunter adams 
you ve been accused of
practicing medicine without a license 
that s a very
grave charge  son 
are you aware that it s unlawful
to practice medicine without
a medical license  
yes  sir  i am 
are you aware that running a medical
clinic without the proper licensing   
can place both you
and the public   
in a great deal of danger  
is a home a clinic  sir  
if you are admitting patients
and treating them   
physical location
is irrelevant 
sir  will you define
treatment for me  
yes  treatment would be defined
as the care of a patient
seeking medical attention 
have you been treating patients 
mr  adams  
i live with several people 
they come and go as they please 
i offer them
whatever help i can 
mr  adams   
have you or have you not
been treating patients at your ranch  
everyone who comes to the ranch
is a patient  yes 
  murmuring  
and every person who comes
to the ranch is also a doctor 
i m sorry  
every person who comes
to the ranch is in need   
of some form of physical
or mental help 
they re patients 
but also every person who comes
to the ranch is in charge of
taking care of someone else  
whether it s cooking for them 
cleaning them   
or even as simple a task
as listening 
that makes them doctors 
i use that term broadly  but is not a
doctor someone who helps someone else  
when did the term  doctor  get
treated with such reverence  as 
 right this way  doctor smith    
or   excuse me  dr  scholl 
what wonderful footpads    
or   pardon me  dr  patterson 
but your flatulence has no odor   
  laughing  murmuring  
at what point in history
did a doctor become more   
than a trusted and learned friend
who visited and treated the ill  
now  you ask me if
i ve been practicing medicine 
well  if this means opening
your door to those in need  
those in pain  
caring for them  listening
to them  applying a cold cloth
until a fever breaks  
if this is practicing medicine 
if this is treating a patient   
then i am guilty
as charged  sir 
did you consider the ramifications
of your actions  
what if one of your patients
had died  
what s wrong
with death  sir  
what are we so mortally
afraid of  
why can t we treat death with
a certain amount of humanity
and dignity and decency   
and  god forbid 
maybe even humor  
death is not the enemy 
gentlemen 
if we re gonna fight a disease 
let s fight one of the most
terrible diseases of all  
indifference 
now  i ve sat in your schools and heard
people lecture on transference   
and professional distance 
transference
is inevitable  sir 
every human being
has an impact on another 
why don t we want that in
a patient doctor relationship  
that s why i ve listened to your
teachings  and i believe they re wrong 
a doctor s mission should be
not just to prevent death   
but also to improve
the quality of life 
that s why you treat a disease 
you win  you lose 
you treat a person  i guarantee you 
you win  no matter what the outcome 
now here today  this room
is full of medical students 
don t let them anesthetize you 
don t let them numb you out
to the miracle of life 
always live in awe of the
glorious mechanism of the human body 
let that be the focus of your studies
and not a quest for grades   
which ll give you no idea what kind
of doctor you will become 
  man  
please try and address the board 
don t wait till you re on the ward
to get your humanity back 
start your interviewing skills 
start talking to strangers 
talk to your friends 
talk to wrong numbers  everyone 
  mr  adams  
  and cultivate friendships   
with those amazing people in the back of
the room   nurses that could teach you 
they ve been with people every day 
they wade through blood and shit 
they have a wealth of knowledge 
and so do the professors you respect  
the ones who are not dead
from the heart up 
  share their compassion 
let that be contagious 
  mr  adams 
i demand that you turn
and address the board 
sir  i want to be a doctor
with all my heart 
i wanted to become a doctor
so i could serve others   
and because of that
i ve lost everything   
but i ve also
gained everything 
i ve shared the lives of patients
and staff members at the hospital 
i ve laughed with them 
i ve cried with them 
this is what i want to do
with my life 
and as god is my witness   
no matter what your decision
today  sir   
i will still become the best damn doctor
the world has ever seen 
now you have the ability
to prevent me from graduating 
you can keep me from getting
the title and the white coat 
but you can t control
my spirit  gentlemen 
you can t keep me from learning 
you can t keep me from studying 
so you have a choice   you could
have me as a professional colleague   
passionate   
or you can have me as an
outspoken outsider  still adamant 
either way  i ll probably
still be viewed as a thorn 
but i promise you one thing 
i am a thorn
that will not go away 
is that all  
i hope not  sir 
we will adjourn briefly 
  chuckles  
  laughs  
thank you 
  laughs  
hunter adams 
  sighs   we find your methods
less than appealing 
your appearance and your demeanor
do not reflect   
what we believe
is necessary   
to earn a patient s trust
and respect 
you openly accuse us of adhering
to time honored practices   
that for years have been the backbone
of the entire medical institution 
however   
we find no fault
in your attempts   
to improve the quality of life
around you 
we find no fault
in your desire   
to expand upon existing
medical practices   
and theories 
we applaud your love
of the patient 
your grades are among
the highest in your class   
and  therefore  we find
no merit in the decision   
to block your graduation
from medical school 
now  along with your crass
and disdainful behavior   
you carry with you a flame   
which one could only hope   
would spread through
the medical profession like a brushfire 
and  uh  dean walcott   
in the future 
i think matters like this   
could best be solved if you yourself
would practice a little   
 excessive happiness  
well  today you go   
from being students in a class
to being members of a class  
a very select class 
you face the future
with your heads held high   
because you are now   
doctors 
  whistling  cheering  
  dean anderson  
dr  michael ames 
  whistling 
applause continue  
dr  doris ackerman 
dr  hunter  patch  adams 
  yea  patch  
    laughing  
well  i m happy to see
you ve finally decided to conform 
more than you know  sir 
it s been a long road
gettin  from there to here
it s been a long time
but my time is finally near
