zasa sent them

  i know 
  you don t make them easier 
  it wasn t my idea that this happened 
  get out of here 
  michael   
yes 
  now they ll fear you 
  maybe they should fear you 
  b j   what s up 
  the archbishop just called back 
we ve arranged some amazing things 
the publicity is phenomenal  you re the
new rockefeller  a philanthropist 
  sign here  please 
  times do change  don t they 
my father hated foundations 
he loved doing it by himself 
man to man  but we re different 
no different than any large corporation 
we control a lot of money with little 
minimise taxes 
with no government control 
  godfather 
  andrew 
  off to rome   
  i wanted to thank you for everything 
  do you want some breakfast 
  thanks  i can t 
  how s your italian 
  devo fare un po  di pratica 
  his father was a great lawyer 
  i know 
didn t live to see him ordained  i did 
did you ever see one of those 
beautiful  i was so proud 
let me walk you out 
if you hear any rumours in the vatican 
let me know 
no  andrew has the true faith 
don corleone 
i need your help  and not just
to light a little candle 
my gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the holy church 
then rome decides to put me
in charge of the vatican bank   
   but i was never a true banker 
mea culpa  i trusted my friends 
friendship and money   
oil and water   
indeed 
but these  friends  used the good name
of the church to feed their greed 
if money was lost   
   then i am to blame 
if only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit 
769 million   
the church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation  immobiliare 
you know the one i mean 
largest landlord on earth 
real estate worth six billion dollars 
that s true 
and the vatican vote
is necessary for control 
no  you re mistaken 
this isn t a question of one person
deciding  one deciding vote 
this is like any other company 
we have directors and very old rules 
the pope himself
would have to approve you 
we ve sold the casinos 
all businesses having to do
with gambling 
we have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate 
the corleones are prepared to deposit
500 million dollars in the vatican bank
when mr  corleone receives
majority control of immobiliare 
immobiliare could be something new 
a european conglomerate 
few families have control
of such a company 
it seems that  in today s world 
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness 
600 million dollars 
don t overestimate
the power of forgiveness 
don corleone 
this deal with immobiliare can make you
one of the richest men in the world 
your whole past history  and the history
of your family  would be washed away 
600 million 
the motion under discussion
relates to corleone group s proposal
to acquire 100 000 000 newly issued
class a voting shares 
    corleone capital invested directly
into international immobiliare 
an old and respected
european company 
mr  corleone has an ambitious programme
to expand this real estate company
into an international conglomerate   
   by eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited   
mr  corleone  excuse me 
didn t you recently deposit 200 million
in the vatican bank 
which is affiliated with immobiliare 
true  why not 
wasn t there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit 
mr  chairman  if i may 
the vito andolini corleone foundation 
of which mary corleone is chairman 
has made an endowment
of 1 00 million dollars 
the money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the vatican 
does that answer your question 
i have always believed that helping your
fellow man is profitable in every sense 
personally and bottom line 
my fellow shareholders  if europe
and america can learn to co operate 
if we can learn to pool our wealth 
share our markets 
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world 
thank you for your time 
i hope that you will look favourably
on my proposal  thank you 
let me have this microphone here 
will we let a criminal run our company 
he s got the map of sicily on his face 
order 
he s either a catholic or a mafioso   
the hamilton investors group
cannot support this proposal 
your excellency   
mr  chairman   
   the vatican bank feels
that international immobiliare   
   will be safe in mr  corleone s hands 
   subject to audit and final ratification 
which must take place in rome 
please join me in welcoming
mr  michael corleone 
dad 
tony says that i m a front
for the foundation 
that you re using me to pull the strings 
  to get the money where you want it 
  please 
  to shine up your public image 
  mary 
mary  this is real 
this foundation is real 
i wanted anthony to be part of it 
i thought you would be together on this 
i won t interfere 
i ll help  but only if you ask 
what is this really for 
why are you doing this 
why am i doing this 
i m doing this for my children 
you re doing it for your children too 
this foundation is supposed to
help all people 
that s the purpose 
this is legitimate 
mary  i swear  this is legitimate 
dad  i want this to bring me
closer to you 
i would burn in hell to keep you safe 
go in the other car  i ll ride with michael 
go  go  go 
as your family s oldest friend  i m
always chosen to bring you messages 
tell me  don altobello 
your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them 
they worship you   
   but their hearts are broken  because
they think you abandoned them 
they want to share your deal
on immobiliare  to be a family again 
it can purify their money 
this i cannot do 
immobiliare must be legitimate 
i know 
but they re unhappy 
and you 
i ask nothing for myself 
only peace in my old age 
but i must please the world around me 
michael  your father was a
reasonable man  learn from him 
i learned many things from my father 
call a meeting  my friend 
so there are no debts or grudges 
we will make the peace  you and l 
the vatican announced today   
that pope paul vi has canceled
his sunday blessing   
due to ill health 
his physician has ordered
total bed rest   
and cessation of all activities 
they ve had a press conference  the
pope s condition is grave   gravissimo   
the purpose of this meeting
is to ratify   
the motion passed by our
shareholders in new york 
please   
our group represents a consortium
of catholic businessmen
against the corleone control 
the vatican has cast its vote  corleone
group already controls the board 
according to the lateran treaty 
the vatican vote must be ratified here 
here in rome  by the pope 
the pope is gravely ill 
until he recovers  i am powerless 
  what if he dies 
  then   
   as you americans say 
all bets are off 
gentlemen  please 
this is a brief delay  nothing more 
your excellency  gentlemen   
i advise you to join us in our prayers
for the holy father s recovery 
we had an agreement 
this meeting was to be
merely a formality 
  please sit down 
  i d rather stand  give me an answer 
the immobiliare has its roots in the
european tradition  please understand 
i understand 
your tactics are despicable 
that s quite an indictment 
coming from a corleone 
  gentlemen  gentlemen 
  remember you are in the vatican 
  what is it that you want 
  yes  you will take control 
we ll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet 
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction 
otherwise  who can say how long
your stay with us will last 
it s not personal  it s only business 
you should know  godfather

cugina

i d like to take joey zasa for a ride
in this and drop him 
joey zasa is nothing 
he s a small time enforcer 
he bluffs and threatens 
he s nothing  you can see him coming
a mile away 
  we should kill him before he   
  no 
never hate your enemies 
it affects your judgement 
nice to see you again  mr  corleone 
hey  girls  let s go 
we trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos 
it s not even 20 years  you ve sold the
casinos and made fortunes for all of us 
bravo  don corleone 
thank you 
friends  i have come here
because our business together is done 
we have prospered 
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us 
that s it 
but i do have a little surprise  al 
your shares in the casinos 
i ve cut the red tape  so you could
get your money right away 
50 million dollars 
  not everybody gets the same 
  nothing for you   
  it depends on your investment 
  michael  this is really generous 
wonderful 
  parisi  how much did you invest 
  i don t remember 
you re blessed 
my family has done much of
the hard work  taken many risks 
all to make money
for the rest of the families 
you all know joey zasa 
he is  i admit  an important man 
his picture is on the cover
of the new york times magazine 
he gets the esquire magazine award
for the best dressed gangster 
the newspapers praise him
because he hires blacks 
which shows he has a good heart 
he is famous 
who knows  maybe one day
he ll make all of you popular 
it s true 
i make more of a bella figura 
that is my nature 
but i also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises 
i d like a little pin from the pope 
sure  i take the blacks and the spanish
into my family 
because that s america 
and you guarantee
that they don t deal drugs 
i don t guarantee that  i guarantee
that i ll kill anybody who does 
  let me talk to him 
  who can refuse don altobello 
  joey  are you   
  no 
i say to all of you  i have been
treated this day with no respect 
i ve earned you all money  i ve made
you rich and i asked for little 
good  you will not give  so i ll take 
as for don corleone 
he makes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy 
you must choose between us 
no  joey 
michael  we could reason together 
no 
michael  please    let s agree 
he doesn t know what he s   
no  no 
michael  the news is everywhere

immobiliare is already laundering
money in peru and nassau 
we ve worked with you for 40 years 
we should wet our beaks a little

zasa  you son of a bitch   
come on  we re out of here 
  you did good  vincent 
  grazie 
the old dons were pretty much
wiped out 
the survivors made deals with zasa 
  altobello 
  he survived 
he s with his daughters in staten island 
he says he s going to retire in sicily 
joey zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing 
he s just muscle  he doesn t have
the wit for that helicopter attack 
he doesn t even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole commission 
i say we hit back and take zasa out 
never let anyone know
what you re thinking 
let s get a message to joey zasa 
i respect what he s done 
the new overthrows the old  it s natural 
how can you do business
with this guy 
i m a businessman  first and foremost 
i want no further conflict 
  tell him that he can live or he can die 
  vincent  will you shut up 
that s it 
joey zasa   
he can t be doing this alone 
just when i thought i was out 
they pull me back in 
our true enemy has not yet
shown his face 
michael 
  has he had his medicine 
  i don t know what he took 
  i ve got my wind back 
  call a doctor 
  run  run  run

michael corleone has had a diabetic
stroke  i wanted you to know about it 
he s in a coma  i m here to insist

  i ll pray for mr  corleone 
  our thoughts are with mr  corleone

a habit born of a long contemplation
of eternity 
  forget about it  vinnie 
  why  it s a simple hit 
i d love to smack joey zasa and then
whack the fag  but it s impossible 
he s always with people  in front of tv
cameras in his own neighborhood

this is a fantasy  we italian americans
laid the bricks that built this city

who invented the telephone 
we have don ameche 
who played the guy who invented it 
buy yourself a raffle ticket 
maybe you ll win a cadillac 
the salsiccia is wonderful 
here  have a sandwich 
  nice to see you  mr  zasa

  okay  let s go 
joey  how are you 
how are you  buddy boy 
hey  joey zasa  joey  up your ass 
  who is this  do you know him 
  ignore him 
who s going to win the car  the ant 
this is what gives italian americans
a bad name  a cappone like this 
joey  up your ass 
get off the car 
do you have a raffle ticket 
joey  take a look at my raffle ticket 
here s what i think of you

get out of here 
run  joey  you piece of shit 
open the door 
how are you  joe 
zasa 
don t ever again give that kind of order 
not while i m alive 
understand 
you were too sick to make a decision 
i got a go ahead from neri and connie 
connie 
it was the right decision  uncle mike 
it was the wrong decision 
i command this family 
right or wrong   
   it was not what i wanted 
do you understand 
yes 
come on  michael 
yes 
good  vincent  help me to my bed 
i want to talk to you alone for a minute 
you know  i always felt
responsible for you 
you know that 
your father   
   my brother  we were opposites 
we would fight and argue 
but i never doubted his love 
he would do anything for me 
but his temper   
too much  it clouded his reason 
i don t want you to make that mistake 
also   
   he  too  had a way with women 
  vincent   
  so i hear 
what are you doing with my daughter 
what are you doing with her 
it s too dangerous 
do you hear me 
okay 
vincenzo   
when they come 
they ll come at what you love 
michael  you must lead another life 
you have everything a man could
desire  it s time for you to retire 
i have too much responsibility 
immobiliare  it s too difficult now 
you should really get out 
what do you know
about those pezzi da novanta in italy 
i m too old to know anything
about those new people 
i must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes 
  we re not that old 
  but you re very ill 
michael    let me see
what can be done 
let me work to make your path
a little easier 
  your friendship does that always 
  that makes me happy 
joey zasa    you were wrong
about him 
i trust too much 
that s always been my fault 
michael    treachery is everywhere 
you still have your fingers
on the strings  even now 
let s see more of each other 
  michael  in sicily 
  in sicily 
in sicilia 
in sicilia 
how are you 
don bendino  my old friend 
i brought you here so that my old friend
and protector  don tommasino 
could advise us 
what do you think about altobello 
a very talented man 
he has kept the peace between our
sicilian and american friends 
the saint of reason 
a blood bath in atlantic city
left new york a mess 
joey zasa at least was running
a tight ship 
but with him out of the picture
we must step in 
  step back in   
  or the chinese and colombians will 
the corleones left drugs  so new york
is weak  and palermo is strong 
your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind 
who could give the order
for that massacre   
and still pressure the vatican deal 
only lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds 
 our ships must all sail
in the same direction    
italian politics have had these men
for centuries  they are the true mafia 
the archbishop and the vatican bank 
that s the big problem 
they re the same problem 
b j   they re connected 
the archbishop has powerful friends 
they totally protect him 
is there someone in the
church we can turn to 
someone we can tell
our problem to 
cardinal lamberto 
a wise and good man   
very influential 
he will see you 
i will see this cardinal lamberto
and see if we can work things out 
you honour your agreements 
but you are dealing with crooks 
they have no honour 
my word is final 
politics and crime 
they re the same thing 
i ve invited you all here to celebrate
my son s debut in an opera house   
we ll play  philadelphia  
seven cards  two down  four up 
deuces and one eyed jacks are wild 
   in the opera  cavallaria rusticana  
  it s  cavalleria rusticana   dad 
   cavalleria  
i think i have tickets to the wrong opera 
i ve been in new york too long 
you will all receive tickets 
so come on time 
dad  i ve got a present for you 
it comes from the town of corleone
and it s authentic sicilian 
and    i learned it for you 
she was wonderful  beautiful 
i loved her  and then she died 
my trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car 
she drove it before i did 
why is such a beautiful country
so violent 
history 
mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams 
  yes  it was then 
  i worry about you now 
oh  mary  you re such a
warm hearted girl  you always were 
  i love my family 
  even your cousin vincent 
i really love him 
  he s your first cousin 
  then i love him first 
mary  you can t see him 
just don t see him anymore 
he s right  it s too dangerous 
mary  you can t see him anymore 
  not in that fashion 
  no 
  please  promise me 
  no 
  obey me on this 
  no  dad 
mary is smart  dad 
she ll understand eventually 
bella cugina    tesoro mio 
  you wanted to see me 
  yeah 
i want you to do something for me 
it s dangerous 
good  i m in  what do you need 
i want you to sell your soul
to don altobello 
to betray me 
he d never believe me 
  that depends 
  sit down 
i have an idea 
see if you can learn
how high altobello is connected 
arrange a meeting 
you say how devoted you are to me 
tell him your problems 
  ask for his help 
  what problems 
that you want to run away
with my daughter 
but you know that if you do 
i will become your enemy 
  you know that i would never do that 
  i know 
ask altobello to speak to me 
to further the marriage 
but you re cousins  after all  michael
was always a little old fashioned 
say you can t belong to my legitimate
world  that you want your own family 
i could straighten out
what joey zasa left behind 
i could use your friendship
to persuade him 
i would be indebted to you forever 
a corleone knows the value
of such a friend 
then you would work for me 
si 
bacio la mano  don altobello 
if he hints that he wants you
to betray me  get insulted 
because that s his trap 
you re not telling me
the whole truth  vincenzo 
isn t it true  that with michael gone 
the girl controls everything 
  leave the girl out of this 
  of course  you love her 
and she loves you 
i guessed it  didn t l 
you re a wise man  don altobello 
i ll be learning a lot from you 
the richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends 
it s my duty to make the introductions 
don lucchesi 
don altobello tells me that you have
a strong character  a man of respect 
this is the hero who put joey zasa
in his grave 
if we d known of his existence 
we wouldn t have backed joey 
no one wants another joe 
let me be your friend 
  even the strongest man needs friends 
  i m flattered 
you re a man of finance and politics 
things i don t understand 
you understand guns 
finance is a gun 
politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger 
how can i help 
vieni 
blessed is the peacemaker 
for he can be called the child of god 
  tu parli italiano un poco 
  si 
the wheelchair  for don tommasino 
i trusted this business arrangement
with the archbishop  i trusted him 
i was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt 
but  as you see  i m now
the victim of a swindle 
he s stalling me  vast monies have
gone to people in high political places
and the vatican bank is the guarantor 
if what you say is true 
there will be a great scandal 
look at this stone  it has been
in the water for a very long time 
but the water has not penetrated it 
look   
perfectly dry  the same thing
has happened to men in europe 
for centuries they have been
surrounded by christianity 
but christ has not penetrated 
christ doesn t live within them 
  what s happening 
  could you get me something sweet 
some orange juice  candy   
i have trouble with diabetes 
my blood sugar goes low 
i understand 
it happens sometimes
when i m under stress 
i understand 
to come to you
on such a delicate matter   
accusations against your archbishop 
it was difficult for me 
the mind suffers
and the body cries out 
that s true 
would you like to make
your confession 
your eminence  i m   
it s been so long  i wouldn t   
i wouldn t know where to   
it s been 30 years 
i d use up too much of your time  i think 
i always have time to save souls 
  well  i m beyond redemption 
  no  no   
i hear the confessions
of my own priests here 
sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming 
and we must seize the moment 
what is the point of confessing
if i don t repent 
i hear you are a practical man 
what have you got to lose 
go on 
i   
   betrayed my wife 
go on  my son 
i betrayed myself 
i killed men 
and i ordered men to be killed 
go on  my son  go on 
it s useless 
go on  my son 
i killed   
i ordered the death of my brother 
he injured me 
i killed my mother s son 
i killed my father s son 
your sins are terrible 
and it is just that you suffer 
your life could be redeemed 
but i know that you don t believe that 
you will not change 
pope paul vl  the supreme pontiff
of the roman catholic church    
died last night at 9 40 p m 
the pope was 81 years old    
and had been in poor health
for the last several months 
connie   
all my life i ve kept trying
to go up in society 
to where everything higher up
was legal  straight   
but the higher i go 
the more crooked it becomes 
where the hell does it end 
they ve been killing each other
for centuries here 
for money  for pride  for family 
to keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzi da novanta 
i made confession  connie 
i confessed my sins 
why  that s not like you  you don t
have to confess your sins to a stranger 
it was the man 
he s a good man  a true priest 
he can change things 
michael   
you know  sometimes i think
of poor fredo 
drowned  it was god s will 
it was a terrible accident 
but it s finished 
michael  i love you 
i ll always help you 
oh  connie   
i am honored  don altobello  that
you ve come from palermo to visit me 
hey  the little kid  he s grown 
do the donkey for me 
it s been some time since we
did business together 
you are my  ace in the hole  
as we say in america 
i have a stone in my shoe 
you can remove it 
only one stone 
it s dangerous  a famous man 
you will have to take precautions 
tell me what to do 
then i will tell you my price 
ah  what bread 
olive oil   
virgin    only in sicily 
alla salute 
to death 
kay 
  connie

mary  i ve missed you 
  hello  michael 
  mom  look at this

  might bring you luck 
  thanks 
you saved it    i remember 
thank you  dad 
i m proud of you

  tell tony to wait for me 
i will 
buongiorno  signora  at your service 
if i see dad  i ll tell him you left 
you re the only one left
with my father s strength 
if anything happens to michael 
i want you to strike back 
i ll have everything ready 
do you swear 
i swear to you 
here it is 
the house where my father was born 
this is where they came to take him
when he was a boy  to kill him 
wait   
listen to that 
you know mary s in love 
yes  i know 
with a handsome young italian man
with dark eyes   
i won t allow it 
it s wrong  it s wrong and it s dangerous 
 oh  father  my father  
 give me time to pray
to the lord  
the baroness of carini had
betrayed her husband   
and fallen in love with her cousin 
 there will be no forgiveness  
her father stabbed her through
the heart 
honour  huh 
i remember the time you came
to my parents  house
and told me about the family business 
how you d never have anything
to do with it  you sounded like tony 
i was a lot like tony 
  i can barely see him    kay 
  what 
  do you mind driving 
  what s wrong 
my eyes  sometimes
they re all right  but   
i have to see don tommasino   
well   
  there are no bodyguards today 
  i really snuck away 
father  where are you going 
would you like a ride 
i know you  you re mosca
of montelepre 
you were an assassin then 
and you re an assassin now 
i know michael corleone
is at your house 
i will pass through the gates
with you 
how are you 
this is calo  one of my bodyguards
in the old days 
  we can wait here 
  you want a drink 
i spent a lot of time in this room   
   thinking of you 
and then you got married 
  i still thought of you 
  what s in that room 
this is dangerous for you  this is sicily 
  i love this country 
  why 
well  all through history  terrible things
have happened to these people 
terrible injustices 
but they still expect good 
rather than bad  will happen to them 
sort of like me and you 
  how so 
  i m still here  right 
we do have a bad history 
but i m still here 
yes  you are  but with dread 
give me the order 
is that supposed to make me
not dread you 
we re in sicily  it s opera 
okay 
what do we do now 
be reasonable 
let s try not to hurt each other 
i want you to forgive me 
  for what 
  everything 
oh  like god 
no  i need something a little closer 
you couldn t understand 
back in those days 
i loved my father  i swore i would
never be a man like him 
but i loved him and he was in danger 
what could i do 
and then later  you were in danger 
our children were in danger 
what could i do 
you were all that l    loved and valued
most in the world 
now i m losing you  i lost you 
you re gone 
and it was all for nothing  so   
you have to understand 
i had a whole different destiny planned 
all right  i ll stop 
i really don t know what you
want from me  michael 
  i mean   
  i m not the man that you think i am 
  i don t know 
  i love you  kay 
don t dread me anymore 
you know  every night here in sicily   
   l dream about my wife
and my children   
   and how i lost them 
i guess that if it s any consolation 
i want you to know that   
   that   
   l always loved you  michael 
and you know   
   always  i always will 
what is it  what s wrong 
they found don tommasino shot 
is he dead 
my master is dead 
blood calls for blood 
i must have revenge 
some day  you may have to do
a difficult service for me 
command me 
it never ends 
i will avenge him

frederick keinszig  known as  god s
banker   has been reported missing 
he was last seen leaving the rome
offices of vatican owned immobiliare 
also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents 
keinszig  you fool 
his absence casts further suspicion
on the dealings of the vatican bank 
for several years 
the bank and its companies
have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices 
lucchesi  will you please
try to understand 
i have phoned him 
i have waited here by the phone 
you would do well to remember 
mr  lucchesi 
that this pope has very different ideas
from the last one 
goodbye  my old friend 
you could have lived a little longer 
i could be closer to my dream 
you were so loved  don tommasino 
why was i so feared 
and you so loved 
what was it 
i was no less honourable 
i wanted to do good 
what betrayed me 
my mind  my heart 
why do i condemn myself so 
i swear 
on the lives of my children   
give me a chance to redeem myself   
   and i will sin no more 
you look pale  bad news 
tell me right away 
it s not just a bad banking deal 
these guys are butchers 
  what guys 
  lucchesi 
he controls all of them 
altobello  the archbishop   
   others higher up  p2 maybe 
secret unknown 
they re running things 
  i m in their way 
  he s hired an assassin to kill you 
a sicilian  i don t know his name 
but they say he never fails 
then no one is safe 
even the new pope is in danger 
we still have time  we can prevent this 
i tried  vincent 
i tried   
   to keep everything from coming
to this  but it s not possible 
not in this world 
give me the order 
you won t be able to go back 
  you ll be like me 
  good 
all my life i wanted out 
i wanted the family out 
i don t want out 
i want the power to preserve the family 
i m asking for the order 
it s done 
because i can t do it anymore 
well  it doesn t matter 
vincent knows what to do 
come on outside 
take a rest and don t think about it 
  all i do is think about it 
  i m your son 
command me in all things 
give up my daughter 
that s the price you pay   
   for the life you choose 
nephew   
   from this moment on   
   call yourself vincent corleone 
sit 
don vincenzo   
don corleone   
don vincenzo corleone   
e tu  vincenzo

but you can t save him 
he s lost 
think of yourself 
what s your answer  vincent

teatro massimo than in the shower

  my darling constanza 
  don altobello 
  this is a great occasion 
  come  sit down 
happy birthday

we ve just got the word  the pope has
ratified the immobiliare deal  we ve won 
congratulations 
strange how things work 
the pope is doing what you said
he d do  he s cleaning house 
he should be careful 
it s dangerous to be an honest man 
i want to put more muscle backstage
with tony 
on your birthday you used to
shower me with treats 
tootsie rolls 
the nuns who made this cannoli took a
vow of silence  they re the very finest 
  hey
