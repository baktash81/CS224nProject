the publicity is phenomenal youre the
new rockefeller a philanthropist
sign here please
times do change dont they
my father hated foundations
he loved doing it by himself
man to man but were different
no different than any large corporation
we control a lot of money with little
minimise taxes
with no government control
godfather
andrew
off to rome
i wanted to thank you for everything
do you want some breakfast
thanks i cant
hows your italian
devo fare un po di pratica
his father was a great lawyer
i know
didnt live to see him ordained i did
did you ever see one of those
beautiful i was so proud
let me walk you out
if you hear any rumours in the vatican
let me know
no andrew has the true faith
don corleone
i need your help and not just
to light a little candle
my gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the holy church
then rome decides to put me
in charge of the vatican bank
but i was never a true banker
mea culpa i trusted my friends
friendship and money
oil and water
indeed
but these friends used the good name
of the church to feed their greed
if money was lost
then i am to blame
if only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit
769 million
the church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation immobiliare
you know the one i mean
largest landlord on earth
real estate worth six billion dollars
thats true
and the vatican vote
is necessary for control
no youre mistaken
this isnt a question of one person
deciding one deciding vote
this is like any other company
we have directors and very old rules
the pope himself
would have to approve you
weve sold the casinos
all businesses having to do
with gambling
we have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate
the corleones are prepared to deposit
500 million dollars in the vatican bank
when mr corleone receives
majority control of immobiliare
immobiliare could be something new
a european conglomerate
few families have control
of such a company
it seems that in todays world
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness
600 million dollars
dont overestimate
the power of forgiveness
don corleone
this deal with immobiliare can make you
one of the richest men in the world
your whole past history and the history
of your family would be washed away
600 million
the motion under discussion
relates to corleone groups proposal
to acquire 100000000 newlyissued
class a voting shares
corleone capital invested directly
into international immobiliare
an old and respected
european company
mr corleone has an ambitious programme
to expand this real estate company
into an international conglomerate
by eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited
mr corleone excuse me
didnt you recently deposit 200 million
in the vatican bank
which is affiliated with immobiliare
true why not
wasnt there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit
mr chairman if i may
the vito andolini corleone foundation
of which mary corleone is chairman
has made an endowment
of 1 00 million dollars
the money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the vatican
does that answer your question
i have always believed that helping your
fellow man is profitable in every sense
personally and bottom line
my fellow shareholders if europe
and america can learn to cooperate
if we can learn to pool our wealth
share our markets
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world
thank you for your time
i hope that you will look favourably
on my proposal thank you
let me have this microphone here
will we let a criminal run our company
hes got the map of sicily on his face
order
hes either a catholic or a mafioso
the hamilton investors group
cannot support this proposal
your excellency
mr chairman
the vatican bank feels
that international immobiliare
will be safe in mr corleones hands
subject to audit and final ratification
which must take place in rome
please join me in welcoming
mr michael corleone
dad
tony says that im a front
for the foundation
that youre using me to pull the strings
to get the money where you want it
please
to shine up your public image
mary
mary this is real
this foundation is real
i wanted anthony to be part of it
i thought you would be together on this
i wont interfere
ill help but only if you ask
what is this really for
why are you doing this
why am i doing this
im doing this for my children
youre doing it for your children too
this foundation is supposed to
help all people
thats the purpose
this is legitimate
mary i swear this is legitimate
dad i want this to bring me
closer to you
i would burn in hell to keep you safe
go in the other car ill ride with michael
go go go
as your familys oldest friend im
always chosen to bring you messages
tell me don altobello
your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them
they worship you
but their hearts are broken because
they think you abandoned them
they want to share your deal
on immobiliare to be a family again
it can purify their money
this i cannot do
immobiliare must be legitimate
i know
but theyre unhappy
and you
i ask nothing for myself
only peace in my old age
but i must please the world around me
michael your father was a
reasonable man learn from him
i learned many things from my father
call a meeting my friend
so there are no debts or grudges
we will make the peace you and l
the vatican announced today
that pope paul vi has canceled
his sunday blessing
due to ill health
his physician has ordered
total bed rest
and cessation of all activities
theyve had a press conference the
popes condition is grave gravissimo
the purpose of this meeting
is to ratify
the motion passed by our
shareholders in new york
please
our group represents a consortium
of catholic businessmen
against the corleone control
the vatican has cast its vote corleone
group already controls the board
according to the lateran treaty
the vatican vote must be ratified here
here in rome by the pope
the pope is gravely ill
until he recovers i am powerless
what if he dies
then
as you americans say
all bets are off
gentlemen please
this is a brief delay nothing more
your excellency gentlemen
i advise you to join us in our prayers
for the holy fathers recovery
we had an agreement
this meeting was to be
merely a formality
please sit down
id rather stand give me an answer
the immobiliare has its roots in the
european tradition please understand
i understand
your tactics are despicable
thats quite an indictment
coming from a corleone
gentlemen gentlemen
remember you are in the vatican
what is it that you want
yes you will take control
well gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction
otherwise who can say how long
your stay with us will last
its not personal its only business
you should know godfather

you want to do business with me
i will do business with you

no
never hate your enemies
it affects your judgement
nice to see you again mr corleone
hey girls lets go
we trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos
its not even 20 years youve sold the
casinos and made fortunes for all of us
bravo don corleone
thank you
friends i have come here
because our business together is done
we have prospered
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us
thats it
but i do have a little surprise al
your shares in the casinos
ive cut the red tape so you could
get your money right away
50 million dollars
not everybody gets the same
nothing for you
it depends on your investment
michael this is really generous
wonderful
parisi how much did you invest
i dont remember
youre blessed
my family has done much of
the hard work taken many risks
all to make money
for the rest of the families
you all know joey zasa
he is i admit an important man
his picture is on the cover
of the new york times magazine
he gets the esquire magazine award
for the bestdressed gangster
the newspapers praise him
because he hires blacks
which shows he has a good heart
he is famous
who knows maybe one day
hell make all of you popular
its true
i make more of a bella figura
that is my nature
but i also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises
id like a little pin from the pope
sure i take the blacks and the spanish
into my family
because thats america
and you guarantee
that they dont deal drugs
i dont guarantee that i guarantee
that ill kill anybody who does
let me talk to him

come on michael
yes
good vincent help me to my bed
i want to talk to you alone for a minute
you know i always felt
responsible for you
you know that
your father
my brother we were opposites
we would fight and argue
but i never doubted his love
he would do anything for me
but his temper
too much it clouded his reason
i dont want you to make that mistake
also
he too had a way with women
vincent
so i hear
what are you doing with my daughter
what are you doing with her
its too dangerous
do you hear me
okay
vincenzo
when they come
theyll come at what you love
michael you must lead another life
you have everything a man could
desire its time for you to retire
i have too much responsibility
immobiliare its too difficult now
you should really get out
what do you know
about those pezzi da novanta in italy
im too old to know anything
about those new people
i must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes
were not that old
but youre very ill
michael let me see
what can be done
let me work to make your path
a little easier
your friendship does that always
that makes me happy
joey zasa you were wrong
about him
i trust too much
thats always been my fault
michael treachery is everywhere
you still have your fingers
on the strings even now
lets see more of each other
michael in sicily
in sicily
in sicilia
in sicilia
how are you
don bendino my old friend
i brought you here so that my old friend
and protector don tommasino
could advise us
what do you think about altobello
a very talented man
he has kept the peace between our
sicilian and american friends
the saint of reason
a bloodbath in atlantic city
left new york a mess
joey zasa at least was running
a tight ship
but with him out of the picture
we must step in
step back in
or the chinese and colombians will
the corleones left drugs so new york
is weak and palermo is strong
your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind
who could give the order
for that massacre
and still pressure the vatican deal
only lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds
our ships must all sail
in the same direction
italian politics have had these men
for centuries they are the true mafia
the archbishop and the vatican bank
thats the big problem
theyre the same problem
bj theyre connected
the archbishop has powerful friends
they totally protect him
is there someone in the
church we can turn to
someone we can tell
our problem to
cardinal lamberto
a wise and good man
very influential
he will see you
i will see this cardinal lamberto
and see if we can work things out
you honour your agreements
but you are dealing with crooks
they have no honour
my word is final
politics and crime
theyre the same thing
ive invited you all here to celebrate
my sons debut in an opera house
well play philadelphia
seven cards two down four up
deuces and oneeyed jacks are wild
in the opera cavallaria rusticana
its cavalleria rusticana dad
cavalleria
i think i have tickets to the wrong opera
ive been in new york too long
you will all receive tickets
so come on time
dad ive got a present for you
it comes from the town of corleone
and its authentic sicilian
and i learned it for you
she was wonderful beautiful
i loved her and then she died
my trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car
she drove it before i did
why is such a beautiful country
so violent
history
mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams
yes it was then
i worry about you now
oh mary youre such a
warmhearted girl you always were
i love my family
even your cousin vincent
i really love him
hes your first cousin
then i love him first
mary you cant see him
just dont see him anymore
hes right its too dangerous
mary you cant see him anymore
not in that fashion
no
please promise me
no
obey me on this
no dad
mary is smart dad
shell understand eventually
bella cugina tesoro mio
you wanted to see me
yeah
i want you to do something for me
its dangerous
good im in what do you need
i want you to sell your soul
to don altobello
to betray me
hed never believe me
that depends
sit down
i have an idea
see if you can learn
how high altobello is connected
arrange a meeting
you say how devoted you are to me
tell him your problems
ask for his help
what problems
that you want to run away
with my daughter
but you know that if you do
i will become your enemy
you know that i would never do that
i know
ask altobello to speak to me
to further the marriage
but youre cousins after all michael
was always a little oldfashioned
say you cant belong to my legitimate
world that you want your own family
i could straighten out
what joey zasa left behind
i could use your friendship
to persuade him
i would be indebted to you forever
a corleone knows the value
of such a friend
then you would work for me
si
bacio la mano don altobello
if he hints that he wants you
to betray me get insulted
because thats his trap
youre not telling me
the whole truth vincenzo
isnt it true that with michael gone
the girl controls everything
leave the girl out of this
of course you love her
and she loves you
i guessed it didnt l
youre a wise man don altobello
ill be learning a lot from you
the richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends
its my duty to make the introductions
don lucchesi
don altobello tells me that you have
a strong character a man of respect
this is the hero who put joey zasa
in his grave
if wed known of his existence
we wouldnt have backed joey
no one wants another joe
let me be your friend
even the strongest man needs friends
im flattered
youre a man of finance and politics
things i dont understand
you understand guns
finance is a gun
politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger
how can i help
vieni
blessed is the peacemaker
for he can be called the child of god
tu parli italiano un poco
si
the wheelchair for don tommasino
i trusted this business arrangement
with the archbishop i trusted him
i was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt
but as you see im now
the victim of a swindle
hes stalling me vast monies have
gone to people in high political places
and the vatican bank is the guarantor
if what you say is true
there will be a great scandal
look at this stone it has been
in the water for a very long time
but the water has not penetrated it
look
perfectly dry the same thing
has happened to men in europe
for centuries they have been
surrounded by christianity
but christ has not penetrated
christ doesnt live within them
whats happening
could you get me something sweet
some orange juice candy
i have trouble with diabetes
my blood sugar goes low
i understand
it happens sometimes
when im under stress
i understand
to come to you
on such a delicate matter
accusations against your archbishop
it was difficult for me
the mind suffers
and the body cries out
thats true
would you like to make
your confession
your eminence im
its been so long i wouldnt
i wouldnt know where to
its been 30 years
id use up too much of your time i think
i always have time to save souls
well im beyond redemption
no no
i hear the confessions
of my own priests here
sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming
and we must seize the moment
what is the point of confessing
if i dont repent
i hear you are a practical man
what have you got to lose
go on
i
betrayed my wife
go on my son
i betrayed myself
i killed men
and i ordered men to be killed
go on my son go on
its useless
go on my son
i killed
i ordered the death of my brother
he injured me
i killed my mothers son
i killed my fathers son
your sins are terrible
and it is just that you suffer
your life could be redeemed
but i know that you dont believe that
you will not change
pope paul vl the supreme pontiff
of the roman catholic church
died last night at 940 pm
the pope was 81 years old
and had been in poor health
for the last several months
connie
all my life ive kept trying
to go up in society
to where everything higher up
was legal straight
but the higher i go
the more crooked it becomes
where the hell does it end
theyve been killing each other
for centuries here
for money for pride for family
to keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzi da novanta
i made confession connie
i confessed my sins
why thats not like you you dont
have to confess your sins to a stranger
it was the man
hes a good man a true priest
he can change things
michael

of poor fredo
drowned it was gods will
it was a terrible accident
but its finished

ill always help you

offices of vatican owned immobiliare
also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents
keinszig you fool
his absence casts further suspicion

the bank and its companies
have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices
lucchesi will you please
try to understand
i have phoned him
i have waited here by the phone
you would do well to remember
mr lucchesi
that this pope has very different ideas
from the last one
goodbye my old friend
