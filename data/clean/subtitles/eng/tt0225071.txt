before my baby gets here 
you know what l m saying 
has he been here 
l was expecting him this
morning  he shops for me 
l give him money from the settlement
every week 
can t talk about that with him 
when he comes here  do you ever
talk about the accident 
 does he ever mention the past

l try to let him
find his own way through 
l feel he needs that 
why are you here  sharon 
l want to know how to help him 
 you are helping him 
 l don t think so 
what makes you think that 
l took him to the cemetery  
the cemetery 
l thought it might help 
he needs to face it 
he will face it  in his time 
he built a wall around that whole day
and that night 
my daughter and my grandson 
he can t help it 
a cemetery    
do you know how hard it is for me
to go to the cemetery 
l was just trying to help him
get back to some kind of life 
he was coming back 
don t you realize how he s
changed these past weeks 
his apartment  his life 
he fell in love 
why do you want to rush things  why
does everybody rush things these days 
l was scared 
scared of what 
of losing him 
and l guess that s what l did 
l lost him 
you were just trying to find your way 
what else can we do 
you think l m always sure about what
l should or shouldn t say to him 
l just try to do what s right   
   and hope that he ll
find the love in it 
look at you   
   so worried now  and miserable

   wanted to wish you both the best   
  l just want to wish you both well
and say congratulations

hi  mom  dad  congratulations 
you know  being in this house
reminds of something 
l was about 10 years old 
me and larry were playing
alien invasion 
remember  lar 
anyway  we were making a lot of noise 
dad came home from work 
tired and pissed off 
we were yelling like mad 
he burst into the room and he yells 
  what the hell are you doing   
and l was scared 
l was really scared 
and l said 
  we re playing alien invasion   
and he said    l ll show you
a damn alien invasion   
he picks me up 
he picks me up off the floor
and he throws me on the couch 
then he grabs larry and picks him up
and throws him on the couch 
and then    
then he starts making monster noises 
he says    we came to earth
to kick ass   
me and larry  we re running
and jumping at him 
we re laughing so hard   
   l almost wet myself 
and we keep running and jumping
on him  and he keeps tossing us 
and growling and beeping 
lt was great 
lt was great 
l ll never forget that 
and l miss that 
l miss it 
anyway  l just   
   wanted to say thanks for that  dad 
thanks

what are you doing here 
you invited me 
are you okay 
yeah  l m okay 
l wanted to apologize 
for what 
for wanting everything to be perfect 
you were right  l was pushing you 
then l realized that   
   it doesn t have to be perfect 
l mean    
lt can be whatever it is 
they don t like me very much
in there 
they re lucky to have you in there 
 that s a nice thing to say 
 lt s not a nice thing
