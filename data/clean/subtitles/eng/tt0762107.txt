are you trying

sort of
anyhooser beneficiaries can only be
changed for three events
births deaths and marriages
according to our records we did
contact you when your wife passed away
you had a year
you should have responded
like a crazy person
i was busy mourning the death of my wife
off the record
i could suggest something
thats a little more simple
and perhaps more fulfilling
to speed things up
that would be great
what do what do you got
should you remarry
your new wife at that time
could be named your primary beneficiary
so if theres somebody special
in your life
i mean who knows
maybe even someone you just met
and you are ready
to make a commitment
maybe nows the time

yeah yeah yeah sure
speaklng ln pseudo japanese
so my assistant says
that your domestic partnership
is being challenged
by the city
well not exactly challenged yet
but theyre definitely sniffing around
home visit
yeah
youre being targeted
targeted
its like an audit
who did they send
it was a glen somebody
probably the initial interviewer
but if you get a followup from
a funny little guy named clint fitzer
then weve got real trouble
yeah the citys really been cracking down
ever since the bensley case
whats that
well in colorado a heterosexual
government employee married his gay friend
so the friend could be covered
under bensleys health insurance
the state found out about it
fired bensley and prosecuted them both
for fraud
really
oh yeah
i mean these people needed
to be made an example of
i mean gays and lesbians have not
been fighting for these rights for 40 years
to be made a mockery of
but you guys have
nothing to worry about
because youre
a legitimate gay couple right
oh yeah were
no were bigtime fruits
i used to wrestle in high school
and i loved it
okay
curiosity kicking up again
what exactly did they get
the hetero bastards
well bensley got five years
and his gay friend got three
and a coworker of bensleys
got 18 months
why what did he do
well bensley told him what was going on
and he never reported it to the authorities
so he was convicted of obstructing justice
and conspiracy to commit fraud
pretty rough huh
when i used to climb the rope in gym class
i wished it was a guy
well there is a secret weapon
that really might help get these guys
off your back
oh good
oh great
well we love secrets
yeah we do them
all the time yeah
both pretendlng to whlsper
oh yeah
oh i wont tell anyone
nobody tells
that was a key he was throwing away
thats what that was
leave a trail
you know
the strongest evidence
for genuinely demonstrating
a domestic partnership
is to take a quick drive
on up to canada
and legitimize
your relationship
legitimize
get married
marry larry
chuck all right
