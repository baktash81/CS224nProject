 speaklng ln pseudo japanese 
so my assistant says
that your domestic partnership
is being challenged
by the city 
well  not exactly challenged yet 
but they re definitely sniffing around 
home visit 
yeah 
you re being targeted 
targeted 
it s like an audit 
who did they send 
it was a glen somebody 
probably the initial interviewer 
but if you get a follow up from
a funny little guy named clint fitzer 
then we ve got real trouble 
yeah  the city s really been cracking down
ever since the bensley case 
what s that 
well  in colorado  a heterosexual
government employee married his gay friend
so the friend could be covered
under bensley s health insurance 
the state found out about it 
fired bensley and prosecuted them both
for fraud 
really 
oh  yeah 
i mean  these people needed
to be made an example of 
i mean  gays and lesbians have not
been fighting for these rights for 40 years
to be made a mockery of 
but you guys have
nothing to worry about
because you re
