l had nothing to do with scarza s murder 
who could have killed
anthony scarza and his family 
that s a stupid question  get off my back 
mr  weinstein  explain the technicality
involving the lack of admissible evidence 
that s a legality
that can t be explained at this time 
mr  weinstein  you don t seem surprised
about the decision 
l don t know why they waste
the taxpayers  money 
this whole thing is an arbitrary attack
on a legitimate businessman 
 do you have any comments

ricca  you re a killer

murderer 
today the noted labor leader
carmine ricca   
   was acquitted on a technicality 
the lack of admissible evidence 
ricca had been charged with complicity   
   in the murders of labor reformer
anthony scarza and his family 
when he appeared outside
the courthouse this afternoon  a free man   
   it touched off a wild 
mob like demonstration 
but the police were finally able
to bring it under control   
   and there have been
no reports of injuries 
but one can expect an uproar
from an angry and alarmed crowd   
   which fully expected ricca
to be convicted 
and l m sure we haven t heard
the last of the ricca case 
art brown reporting from city hall 
cop 
gino  for christ s sake

these days 
a cop kills a hoodlum on the street

the body some place 
because those snot nosed
young bastards

what kind of a load do you use in that  44

try knocking on the door 
 hi 
 hi 
do you always live in the dark 
well  you meet a better class of people
in the dark sometimes  come on in 
sit down 
harry  this is briggs  are you alone 
no  actually 
l m entertaining a young lady friend 
put your pants back on  callahan 
and come to the city morgue right away 
the morgue  what the hell for  briggs 
l m not on homicide anymore 
l m a stakeout man now  remember 
not anymore  callahan 
you and your partner
are back on homicide 
this is a little dramatic  isn t it  briggs 
not your usual style 
lt s meant to be  callahan 
this thing might be bigger
than even we think it is 
hijacking and gambling 
trucking 
narcotics and prostitution 
this is the cream in the bottle 
someone wants
to put the courts out of business 
so far  you ve said nothing wrong 
this one just came in an hour ago 
somebody wants it all 
this guy was just a pimp 
that s one of his girls 
how did she get it 
sometime before he got hit  he poured
a can of drain cleaner down her throat 
that shows a certain sense of style 
you re all heart  callahan 
am l gonna have to have him
leaning over my shoulder 
you work with briggs on this  callahan 
but if you ever lean out of line  so help me 
l ll flop you lower than whale shit 
speaking of whale shit 
what have you turned up  briggs 
nobody in my department
is sitting on their ass 
see this thing  callahan  the chief 
he calls me on this all the time 
even in the can 
l haven t been out of my shoes
in 48 hours   
   and still we have no witnesses  not one 
ln these cases  there s always
an officer right on top of the crime 
but nobody s ever seen a thing 
 who was the officer on this one 
 a patrolman  sweet 
wasn t it  briggs 
sweet seems like a good man 
l ll get on the ballistic reports
first thing in the morning 
we ran all the slugs through ballistics 
we ll never see those guns 
lt was too professional 
you re wasting your time 
well  it takes me time  briggs 
a man has to know his limitations 
warm enough 
you re my first cop 
guess that ll be two firsts tonight 
won t it 
what do the others look like 
the gun was a  357 magnum 
the other bullets are all too deformed
to do us any good 
hollow points  fired point blank  you know 
we were lucky to get these two 
l found them in the pimp s car 
 357 magnum 
maybe it s a cop  maybe it s harry 
nobody hates hoodlums
as much as he does 
whoever it is  he enjoys it 
lt s possible the man was dead
with the first shot 
the others were thrown in
just for good measure 
 he unloaded a whole magazine into him 
 one big mothering hole  huh 
well  everybody has to pay something 
he would have to be standing right here 
this close   
   point blank range 
the driver s license
and the  100 bill were out 
almost like he was showing it
to a traffic cop 
yeah 
from what we have  it figures somebody
to be impersonating a police officer 
on the cars  at least 
lt s been done before 
this close  it would have to be
somebody he would never recognize 
or never suspect 
lou guzman  ex meat lugger
with a first grade education 
he started working for the old boss
of bosses as a hitter 
he controls narcotics state wide 
and now dabbles in prostitution   
   has big friends everywhere 
l want casale and digiorgio on him 
next  thank you 
this one is for your special talents 
callahan 
frank palancio 
two hundred and twelve pounds 
lndicted for murder 23 times 
no convictions 
complains about his health now 
suffers from ulcers  migraine headaches 
dangerously violent 
at one point 
he was ricca s principle assassin 
lf you mix it with him  he won t back off 
he s all yours  callahan 
that s very nice  lieutenant 
but l don t think palancio  
l want you on him  callahan 
l d bust palancio for stepping
on a crack on the sidewalk if l could   
   but this isn t his style 
not the cars anyway  it s too direct 
callahan  you just keep your nose
pressed against palancio s ass   
   until l get a warrant
from the da s office to bring him in 
and l want the first conviction
on this animal 
conviction 
he s liable to be your next victim 
what are you asking for  lieutenant 
l m not asking you to follow him  lnspector 
for the last goddamn time  l m telling you 
next 
nick royale  palancio s no  1 hitter 
he s had good training 
what s happening 
nothing  just a lot of peeping and checking 
checking and peeping 
l knew an old boy once
who used to keep pigs under his bed 
pigs  the eating kind 
the eating kind 
ls all you ever think of your stomach 
that s very interesting 
l think we better get going 
yeah 
 they re splitting up  which one  harry 
 we ll stay with these two 
across the bridge 
it s out of our jurisdiction 
yeah 
well 
stick with the money 
pull over and stop 
what are you trying to do 
he doesn t even know we re cops 
he may panic  and besides 
we don t belong over here anyway 
l hope he does panic 
then l ll get him for 23 other murders 
and if he doesn t   
   then l may be right about something
that s been nagging at me 
l sure hope l m not 
what 
l don t want to be winning bets
for anybody 
go a little faster  l m on their side 
 roll down your window 
 what  are you out of your mind 
 l ve never been wrong yet  have l 
 l don t know why l m doing this 
 say  excuse me  could you help us out 
 what do you want 
maybe you could help us 
we seem to be lost 
we were looking for the entrance
to san quentin  you know where that is 
lt s back there  don t you see too good 
yeah  l see fine  l just wanted to know
whether you knew where san quentin was 
and you do  don t you  asshole 
get you yet  you son of a bitch 
you always gotta do things your way 
don t you 
no wonder briggs stays on your tail 
you do things someone else s way
and you take your life in your own hands 
that son of a bitch guzman 
he hasn t gone out for almost
24 hours now 
hey  one of our guys took a spill 
lt s charlie mccoy  seems to be okay 
let me take a look 
yeah  he s okay 
there he is 
so  all you ve got to do
is sit around all day  guzman 
this coke is out of sight 
oh  guzman gets the best  baby 
oh  you bitch  don t spill it 
that stuff s worth  900 an ounce 
you better not spill it 
don t get so uptight 
nobody says   don t   to me 
you understand  nobody 
l never touch the stuff 
you want to put that over there now 
take over for me  will you  ed 
damn  l wish something would happen 
take it easy 
that s what stakeouts are all about 
waiting

what s going on 
move it  people 
please  sir  stand back 
yes  sir 
yes  sir 
no  sir  we won t let anything
out to the press 
yes  sir 
you endangered an entire investigation
by trying to push something 
not to mention your own lives 
you blew the whole palancio stakeout 
lnstead of keeping him under surveillance
as l told you to   
   you had to harass him 
what do you have to say about that 
what do l tell avery  what 
you tell him it s not palancio 
you tell him it s a traffic cop 
a cop 
that s right 
a traffic cop  are you out of your mind 
do you expect me to believe
that a traffic cop   
   is killing off all the top criminals
in the city  who 
lt s charlie mccoy 
he s ready for the rubber gun squad 
he even tried to kill himself 
charlie mccoy 
guzman was hit today 
a cop was killed  lt was charlie mccoy 
 mccoy 
 yes  charlie mccoy 
the only reason l don t bust you
into the bag this minute   
   is l know the two of you
were close friends 
l was just about to call his wife 
or you can  if you want to 
l know he had kids 
yeah 
 who reported it 
 davis 
davis 
what happened
to the digiorgio stakeout team 
lt was an accidental coincidence 
davis happened to be going by  it happens 
mccoy was already dead
when he got there 
any witnesses 
none 
 l ll make that call 
 go ahead 
harry  if it means anything coming
from me  l m sorry about charlie 
but it s palancio  believe me 
l ll have a warrant in 48 hours 
you can pick him up 
he s all yours 
well  thank you for coming  harry 
you sure you have to leave 
l won t have any place to go
for a sit down dinner anymore 
l never really did like it here very much 
l always liked the change of seasons 
l m going to take him home  lt s time 
lt s time he went home 
come on  kids  let s get in the car 
lt was nice of that young man
to help us with the children 
goodbye  harry  we ll all miss you 
 bye  doll 
take them
to the passenger terminal  please 
lt was nice of you to come out 
you didn t have to do that 
lf l d have been there sooner 
he might still be alive 
he didn t deserve to get it that way 
lf there s anything l can do    
l feel responsible somehow 
the next shooter is callahan 
davis on deck 
you sure shot the pants off
of everybody with that score  harry 
l ve never seen you smoother 
by the way  l personally want to tell you   
   how sorry l am
about what happened to charlie 
what l can t figure out  frank 
is how that kid  davis  got in there first 
you guys were right across the street 
l don t have a goddamned idea  harry 
the kid came out of nowhere 
we were in that garage
before you could spit 
maybe l m slowing down in my old age
or something  l don t know 
l want to be the first to congratulate you
on what l think will be the winning score 
you shaded me by seven points 
the only person now
who has a chance is davis 
shoot  em up 
l think the kid beat you  harry 
lt happens 
harry  he edged you by four points 
that evens it up on the overall champion 
you have your choice in the shoot off 
bull s eye or combat 
combat 
out 
five  46 seconds  score  perfect 
good luck  sir 
a good guy 
that last one was a good guy 
36 seconds 
but l m sorry  harry  you hit a good guy 
you had a bad break 
l really don t deserve it 
you won  didn t you 
 yes  sir  but  
 that s all that matters 
you mind if l try that one 
chester  how about six 
not bad  l seem to have lost the last one 
you get used to it 
l can see how you would  at that 
you said five minutes
and l ve been waiting for a half an hour 
don t you ever get hungry 
 lt just didn t seem like a half hour 
 yeah  well it has been 
l went over to my butcher s yesterday
and picked up some veal 
pops is really an artist  man  l could
watch that man cut meat all day long 
why don t you come home with me and    
my wife s a good cook 
have a little dinner with us 
no  thanks  l just saw something
that killed my appetite 
we ll catch those animals with their pants
down  l was going to call you at home 
we got our search warrants
and multiple charges 
we re going to make a city wide raid
tomorrow morning 
palancio is yours 
just don t take him out head first  harry 
l think you ll find what l want to show you
in ballistics very interesting 
you ll find more leads than you can
shake a stick at tomorrow morning 
 good morning  harry  sir 
 walter 
do you mind excusing us
for a few minutes 
sure 
there s only two 
 l wonder what happened to the others 
 federal boys have them 
well 
take a look 
close  real close 
but there s still a lot of lines
that don t match up 
all this proves is that these two bullets   
   came from barrels
with a similar twist and width of rifling 
you don t think it would stand up
as evidence 
as it is  no 
but l ll have a full comparison report made 
no problem 
you re probably right 
besides  it isn t necessary yet 
what do you mean    yet   
where d you get that slug 
 l d just as soon not say for the time being 
 don t play games on this 
whose side are you on anyway 
lt s just a wild shot
and l m probably wrong 
l d like to handle it my own way 
by the way  l d like to have davis
and sweet as my back up squad tomorrow 
they re just rookies for christ s sake 
you drum up somebody in the department
who can shoot as well and l ll use them 
goddamn it 
there isn t supposed to be any shooting 
besides  they don t have the experience yet
for a job like this 
how the hell s a man supposed to get
experience if nobody gives him a chance 
and davis is the new pistol champion 
suppose they panic and start shooting 
nothing wrong with shooting 
as long as the right people get shot 
 let him know who you are and keep cool 
 okay 
l want you to keep an eye
on davis and sweet 
what for 
just do it  will you 
all right 
 you all set 
 all set 
we ll take off in three cars 
davis and sweet will make the arrest 
early will cover 
l ll be on the back at the pier
in case anybody makes a break for it 
lf there ll be trouble  that s where it ll start 
we re holding the other squads back
until you ve made your arrest 
yours is the most important  it ll be
the first  we don t want any foul ups 
 right 
 right 
l d never walk up to a door with harry 
too many people don t like him 
thanks  l needed that 
 you boys ready 
 yes  sir 
 thank you for requesting us 
 sir  we won t let you down 
well  l m depending on that 
yeah 
who is this 
what was that  nickie 
somebody said we ll be hit in two minutes 
they ll be dressed like cops 
did it sound like anybody you know 
no  l couldn t tell 
ed  chuck   
   get over to the windows 
l got the water side 
l ll take the street side 
lf they are cops  this could be a set up 
after the holes they put in ricca
you want me to wait and see 
lf they re cops  they ll have papers 
car coming  frank 
there s a big guy out there 
 he got a uniform on 
 no 
he ain t no cop 
cops always come in the front door 
another car 
why didn t they come in squad cars
if they re cops 
that big guy s working himself around
by those containers 
he s got a gun out 
two uniforms in it 
that ain t no cop s gun  frank 
there s a cop in uniform coming up
to the door 
we aren t open  come back tomorrow 
police officers 
we d like to ask you some questions 
yeah  l m just a watchman  nobody s here 
we re looking for mr  frank palancio 
would you open the door 
we have a warrant for his arrest 
l said nobody s here  goddamn it 
we have warrants
for a search of the premises 
serve them 
they got sweet  send some help  quick 
cease firing 
throw your weapons out and come out
with your hands behind your heads 
 bullshit 
 fuck you 
you sure you don t want a local for this 
takes about seven stitches 
no  thanks 
okay  it s your ass 
my head  cut s on my head 
why does everybody suddenly
become a comedian in here 
does he have to stay in here 
no  l could stop and let the man s
brains run out all over his shoes 
rogers  l don t need to have a doctor
display that kind of attitude 
a police officer is dead 
sorry 
l got those warrants
for a search of the premises  callahan   
   not for you to become
judge  jury and executioner 
lt was supposed to be a simple arrest 
arresting a killer like palancio
isn t always simple 
people are guilty until proven  
l mean    
goddamn it  you know what l mean 
the city s on the edge
of the worst violence in its history   
   and you have to start
full scale military operations 
l didn t start shooting at anyone
who didn t start shooting at me first 
each time you pull out that gun 
my paperwork backs up for three months 
the chief and l have already
conferred on this matter 
a full investigation is warranted here 
what about a dead cop 
 l warned you against taking them 
 sweet was killed with the first shot 
besides they were tipped off 
they knew we were coming  briggs 
how  don t hand me that crap 
they knew we were coming 
after 200 arrests  l know the difference 
lf l have my way  callahan  you won t make
another arrest as long as you live 
ls that all  lieutenant 
no  that s not all 
l want that slug you showed me 
l ran that through ballistics  it was nothing 
the rifling was totally different 
lt s still state s evidence 
l want it anyway 
eat it 
look  harry  if it means anything 
l think you got the wrong end of the stick 
 you do 
 yeah 
what did they find when they got in there 
nothing  palancio was as clean
as he could possibly be 
they knew we were coming  harry 
why do you figure they opened up on us 
they must ve thought
it was a set up like the others 
 lt was 
 no 
lt was a set up  early 
what l ll lay on you seems so far fetched 
l can t even believe it myself 
l gave up being surprised
working with you anyway 
would you be surprised if l told you   
   a bunch of rookie cops were the ones
who were doing all the killing 
see this 
l gave briggs a phony for the time being 
this is a bullet l took out
of the target range 
lt came from davis  gun 
lt matches up with the one
taken out of charlie mccoy s body 
davis  that s insane 
maybe so  but somebody tipped off
palancio that we were coming 
wanting me killed or palancio
or hopefully both 
yeah  but sweet died today 
sweet was sacrificed 
what s more important if l m right 
l ll be sacrificed 
they ve gotta figure l told you 
which means you ll be sacrificed 
yeah 
lf anything happens to me 
l want you to give that to lt  briggs 
okay 
what happens if they get us both 
then they win 
lt s not hard to understand
how this could happen  the way things are 
as incredible as it seems  there may be
a sub organization within the police force 
sort of a death squad
like they had in brazil some years back 
damn 
some nights l wake up  wonder
where the hell the world s going to 
l want you to take care of yourself 
you understand 
hi 
hi 
jesus  what happened to your face 
nothing  just a few stitches 
l was going to the market 
how about if l bring back a few beers 
good  l could use a beer right about now 
l ve got your key  so l ll get your mail  too 
all right  baby 
keep it warm 
do you have any idea how hard it is
to prosecute a cop 
you heroes have killed
a dozen people this week 
what are you gonna do next week 
kill a dozen more 
ls that what you guys are all about 
being heroes 
all our heroes are dead 
we are the first generation   
   that s learned to fight 
we re simply ridding society
of killers that would be caught   
   and sentenced anyway
if our courts worked properly 
we began with the criminals
that the people know   
   so that our actions would be understood 
lt s not just a question
of whether or not to use violence 
there simply is no other way  lnspector 
you of all people   
   should understand that 
either you re for us or you re against us 
l m afraid you ve misjudged me 
 hi  sunny 
 hi  sue 
no  no 
harry  what are you doing 
hey  what s going on down here 
l m taking the mailbox apart 
what does it look like 
 you people live here  don t you 
 yeah 
what are you doing to the mailbox 
did you lose you key 
why don t you mind
your own goddamn business 
that s my mailbox  too 
don t you get smart with me 
tampering with the mail
is a federal offense 
l m calling the police 
l am the police 
what 
the cop that lives upstairs 
what s that 
plastic explosive 
a bomb 
that s right 
lf you d bothered me any more 
we d all be stuck to the ceiling 
 do you want to hold it 
 no  l don t want to get involved 
go to your apartment and stay there 
don t open for anybody 
homicide  lt  briggs 
lnspector callahan calling 
callahan  where are you 
look  briggs 
l just found a bomb in my mailbox 
l want you to get a man
over to early s house right away 
what 
l ve got a bomb right here 
now get a man over to early s 
you hear me 
right 
stay right where you are 
l ll be down there myself 
don t move 
yeah 
come on in 
l don t like looking down one of those 
where s the bomb 
right on the dresser 
all right  let s get out of here 
avery will want to see this 
you mind driving 
l want to take a closer look at this thing 
this thing could be activated
by your mailbox key 
or by a timer 
turn right  here 
get on the freeway 
the freeway 
you got a new route to city hall 
lieutenant 
your gun s out of its holster  briggs 
first time 
you know you re not going to city hall 
the only way you re going anywhere
is in a rubber bag 
let me have your gun 
now the shells 
three  you always carry three 
throw them out the window 
how do you figure on pulling this off 
briggs 
l run the investigation  with your record 
l can make anything stick 
what l can t understand is 
why you of all people 
a hundred years ago in this city 
people did the same thing 
history justified the vigilantes 
we re no different 
anyone who threatens the security
of the people will be executed 
 evil for evil  harry  retribution 
 that s just fine 
but how does murder fit in 
when police start becoming
their own executioners   
   where s it gonna end  briggs 
pretty soon  you ll start executing people
for jaywalking 
and executing people for traffic violations 
then you end up executing your neighbor
 cause his dog pisses on your lawn 
there isn t one man we ve killed that
didn t deserve what was coming to him 
yes  there is  charlie mccoy 
what would you have done 
l d have upheld the law 
what the hell do you know about the law 
you re a great cop  harry 
you had a chance to join the team 
but you d rather stick to the system 
briggs  l hate the goddamn system 
but until someone comes along   
   with some changes that make sense 
l ll stick with it 
you re about to become extinct 
get off at the next exit 
red 
red 
briggs was right 
you guys don t have enough experience 
just hold it right there  callahan 
no tricks 
your organization s through  briggs 
there s a lot more where they came from 
believe me 
move out of the way  move it 
uphold the law 
you just killed three police officers  harry 
and the only reason
l m not gonna kill you   
   is because l m gonna prosecute you
with your own system 
lt ll be my word against yours
