today the noted labor leader
carmine ricca
was acquitted on a technicality
the lack of admissible evidence
ricca had been charged with complicity
in the murders of labor reformer
anthony scarza and his family
when he appeared outside
the courthouse this afternoon a free man
it touched off a wild
moblike demonstration
but the police were finally able
to bring it under control
and there have been
no reports of injuries
but one can expect an uproar
from an angry and alarmed crowd
which fully expected ricca
to be convicted
and lm sure we havent heard
the last of the ricca case

well you meet a better class of people
in the dark sometimes come on in
sit down
harry this is briggs are you alone
no actually
lm entertaining a young lady friend
put your pants back on callahan
and come to the city morgue right away
the morgue what the hell for briggs
lm not on homicide anymore
lm a stakeout man now remember
not anymore callahan
you and your partner
are back on homicide
this is a little dramatic isnt it briggs
not your usual style
lts meant to be callahan
this thing might be bigger
than even we think it is
hijacking and gambling
trucking
narcotics and prostitution
this is the cream in the bottle
someone wants
to put the courts out of business
so far youve said nothing wrong
this one just came in an hour ago
somebody wants it all
this guy was just a pimp
thats one of his girls
how did she get it
sometime before he got hit he poured
a can of drain cleaner down her throat
that shows a certain sense of style
youre all heart callahan
am l gonna have to have him
leaning over my shoulder
you work with briggs on this callahan
but if you ever lean out of line so help me
lll flop you lower than whale shit
speaking of whale shit
what have you turned up briggs
nobody in my department
is sitting on their ass
see this thing callahan the chief
he calls me on this all the time
even in the can
l havent been out of my shoes
in 48 hours
and still we have no witnesses not one
ln these cases theres always
an officer right on top of the crime
but nobodys ever seen a thing
who was the officer on this one
a patrolman sweet
wasnt it briggs
sweet seems like a good man
lll get on the ballistic reports
first thing in the morning
we ran all the slugs through ballistics
well never see those guns
lt was too professional
youre wasting your time
well it takes me time briggs
a man has to know his limitations
warm enough
youre my first cop
guess thatll be two firsts tonight
wont it
what do the others look like
the gun was a 357 magnum
the other bullets are all too deformed
to do us any good
hollow points fired pointblank you know
we were lucky to get these two
l found them in the pimps car
357 magnum
maybe its a cop maybe its harry
nobody hates hoodlums
as much as he does
whoever it is he enjoys it
lts possible the man was dead
with the first shot
the others were thrown in
just for good measure
he unloaded a whole magazine into him
one big mothering hole huh
well everybody has to pay something
he would have to be standing right here
this close
pointblank range
the drivers license
and the 100 bill were out
almost like he was showing it
to a traffic cop
yeah
from what we have it figures somebody
to be impersonating a police officer
on the cars at least
lts been done before
this close it would have to be
somebody he would never recognize
or never suspect
lou guzman exmeat lugger
with a firstgrade education
he started working for the old boss
of bosses as a hitter
he controls narcotics statewide
and now dabbles in prostitution
has big friends everywhere
l want casale and digiorgio on him
next thank you
this one is for your special talents
callahan
frank palancio
two hundred and twelve pounds
lndicted for murder 23 times
no convictions
complains about his health now
suffers from ulcers migraine headaches
dangerously violent
at one point
he was riccas principle assassin
lf you mix it with him he wont back off
hes all yours callahan
thats very nice lieutenant
but l dont think palancio
l want you on him callahan
ld bust palancio for stepping
on a crack on the sidewalk if l could
but this isnt his style
not the cars anyway its too direct
callahan you just keep your nose
pressed against palancios ass
until l get a warrant
from the das office to bring him in
and l want the first conviction
on this animal
conviction
hes liable to be your next victim
what are you asking for lieutenant
lm not asking you to follow him lnspector
for the last goddamn time lm telling you
next
nick royale palancios no 1 hitter
hes had good training
whats happening
nothing just a lot of peeping and checking
checking and peeping
l knew an old boy once
who used to keep pigs under his bed
pigs the eating kind
the eating kind
ls all you ever think of your stomach
thats very interesting
l think we better get going
yeah
theyre splitting up which one harry
well stay with these two
across the bridge
its out of our jurisdiction
yeah
well
stick with the money
pull over and stop
what are you trying to do
he doesnt even know were cops
he may panic and besides
we dont belong over here anyway
l hope he does panic
then lll get him for 23 other murders
and if he doesnt
then l may be right about something
thats been nagging at me
l sure hope lm not
what
l dont want to be winning bets
for anybody
go a little faster lm on their side
roll down your window
what are you out of your mind
lve never been wrong yet have l
l dont know why lm doing this

you endangered an entire investigation
by trying to push something
not to mention your own lives
you blew the whole palancio stakeout
lnstead of keeping him under surveillance
as l told you to
you had to harass him
what do you have to say about that
what do l tell avery what
you tell him its not palancio
you tell him its a traffic cop
a cop
thats right
a traffic cop are you out of your mind
do you expect me to believe
that a traffic cop
is killing off all the top criminals
in the city who
lts charlie mccoy
hes ready for the rubber gun squad
he even tried to kill himself
charlie mccoy
guzman was hit today
a cop was killed lt was charlie mccoy
mccoy
yes charlie mccoy
the only reason l dont bust you
into the bag this minute
is l know the two of you
were close friends
l was just about to call his wife
or you can if you want to
l know he had kids
yeah
who reported it
davis
davis
what happened
to the digiorgio stakeout team
lt was an accidental coincidence
davis happened to be going by it happens
mccoy was already dead
when he got there
any witnesses
none
lll make that call
go ahead
harry if it means anything coming
from me lm sorry about charlie
but its palancio believe me
lll have a warrant in 48 hours
you can pick him up
hes all yours
well thank you for coming harry
you sure you have to leave
l wont have any place to go
for a sitdown dinner anymore
l never really did like it here very much
l always liked the change of seasons
lm going to take him home lts time
lts time he went home
come on kids lets get in the car
lt was nice of that young man
to help us with the children
goodbye harry well all miss you
bye doll
take them
to the passenger terminal please
lt was nice of you to come out
you didnt have to do that
lf ld have been there sooner
he might still be alive
he didnt deserve to get it that way
lf theres anything l can do
l feel responsible somehow
the next shooter is callahan
davis on deck
you sure shot the pants off
of everybody with that score harry
lve never seen you smoother
by the way l personally want to tell you
how sorry l am
about what happened to charlie
what l cant figure out frank
is how that kid davis got in there first
you guys were right across the street
l dont have a goddamned idea harry
the kid came out of nowhere
we were in that garage
before you could spit
maybe lm slowing down in my old age
or something l dont know
l want to be the first to congratulate you
on what l think will be the winning score
you shaded me by seven points
the only person now
who has a chance is davis
shoot em up
l think the kid beat you harry
lt happens
harry he edged you by four points
that evens it up on the overall champion
you have your choice in the shootoff
bulls eye or combat
combat
out
five 46 seconds score perfect
good luck sir
a good guy
that last one was a good guy
36 seconds
but lm sorry harry you hit a good guy
you had a bad break
l really dont deserve it
you won didnt you
yes sir but
thats all that matters
you mind if l try that one
chester how about six
not bad l seem to have lost the last one
you get used to it
l can see how you would at that
you said five minutes
and lve been waiting for a half an hour
dont you ever get hungry
lt just didnt seem like a half hour
yeah well it has been
l went over to my butchers yesterday
and picked up some veal
pops is really an artist man l could
watch that man cut meat all day long
why dont you come home with me and
my wifes a good cook
have a little dinner with us
no thanks l just saw something
that killed my appetite
well catch those animals with their pants
down l was going to call you at home
we got our search warrants
and multiple charges
were going to make a citywide raid
tomorrow morning
palancio is yours
just dont take him out headfirst harry
l think youll find what l want to show you
in ballistics very interesting
youll find more leads than you can
shake a stick at tomorrow morning
good morning harry sir
walter
do you mind excusing us
for a few minutes
sure
theres only two
l wonder what happened to the others
federal boys have them
well
take a look
close real close
but theres still a lot of lines
that dont match up
all this proves is that these two bullets
came from barrels
with a similar twist and width of rifling
you dont think it would stand up
as evidence
as it is no
but lll have a full comparison report made
no problem
youre probably right
besides it isnt necessary yet
what do you mean yet
whered you get that slug
ld just as soon not say for the time being
dont play games on this
whose side are you on anyway
lts just a wild shot
and lm probably wrong
ld like to handle it my own way
by the way ld like to have davis
and sweet as my backup squad tomorrow
theyre just rookies for christs sake
you drum up somebody in the department
who can shoot as well and lll use them
goddamn it
there isnt supposed to be any shooting
besides they dont have the experience yet
for a job like this
how the hells a man supposed to get
experience if nobody gives him a chance
and davis is the new pistol champion
suppose they panic and start shooting
nothing wrong with shooting
as long as the right people get shot
let him know who you are and keep cool
okay
l want you to keep an eye
on davis and sweet
what for
just do it will you
all right
you all set
all set
well take off in three cars
davis and sweet will make the arrest
early will cover
lll be on the back at the pier
in case anybody makes a break for it
lf therell be trouble thats where itll start
were holding the other squads back
until youve made your arrest
yours is the most important itll be
the first we dont want any foulups
right
right
ld never walk up to a door with harry
too many people dont like him
thanks l needed that
you boys ready
yes sir
thank you for requesting us
sir we wont let you down
well lm depending on that
yeah
who is this
what was that nickie
somebody said well be hit in two minutes
theyll be dressed like cops
did it sound like anybody you know
no l couldnt tell
ed chuck
get over to the windows
l got the water side
lll take the street side
lf they are cops this could be a setup
after the holes they put in ricca
you want me to wait and see
lf theyre cops theyll have papers
car coming frank
theres a big guy out there
he got a uniform on
no
he aint no cop
cops always come in the front door
another car
why didnt they come in squad cars
if theyre cops
that big guys working himself around
by those containers
hes got a gun out
two uniforms in it
that aint no cops gun frank
theres a cop in uniform coming up
to the door
we arent open come back tomorrow
police officers
wed like to ask you some questions
yeah lm just a watchman nobodys here
were looking for mr frank palancio
would you open the door
we have a warrant for his arrest
l said nobodys here goddamn it
we have warrants
for a search of the premises
serve them
they got sweet send some help quick
cease firing
throw your weapons out and come out
with your hands behind your heads
bullshit
fuck you
you sure you dont want a local for this
takes about seven stitches
no thanks
okay its your ass
my head cuts on my head
why does everybody suddenly
become a comedian in here
does he have to stay in here
no l could stop and let the mans
brains run out all over his shoes
rogers l dont need to have a doctor
display that kind of attitude
a police officer is dead
sorry
l got those warrants
for a search of the premises callahan
not for you to become
judge jury and executioner
lt was supposed to be a simple arrest
arresting a killer like palancio
isnt always simple
people are guilty until proven
l mean
goddamn it you know what l mean
the citys on the edge
of the worst violence in its history
and you have to start
fullscale military operations
l didnt start shooting at anyone
who didnt start shooting at me first
each time you pull out that gun
my paperwork backs up for three months
the chief and l have already
conferred on this matter
a full investigation is warranted here
what about a dead cop
l warned you against taking them
sweet was killed with the first shot
besides they were tipped off
they knew we were coming briggs
how dont hand me that crap
they knew we were coming
after 200 arrests l know the difference
lf l have my way callahan you wont make
another arrest as long as you live
ls that all lieutenant
no thats not all
l want that slug you showed me
l ran that through ballistics it was nothing
the rifling was totally different
lts still states evidence
l want it anyway
eat it
look harry if it means anything
l think you got the wrong end of the stick
you do
yeah
what did they find when they got in there
nothing palancio was as clean
as he could possibly be
they knew we were coming harry
why do you figure they opened up on us
they mustve thought
it was a setup like the others
lt was
no
lt was a setup early
what lll lay on you seems so farfetched
l cant even believe it myself
l gave up being surprised
working with you anyway
would you be surprised if l told you
a bunch of rookie cops were the ones
who were doing all the killing
see this
l gave briggs a phony for the time being
this is a bullet l took out
of the target range
lt came from davis gun
lt matches up with the one
taken out of charlie mccoys body
davis thats insane
maybe so but somebody tippedoff
palancio that we were coming
wanting me killed or palancio
or hopefully both
yeah but sweet died today
sweet was sacrificed
whats more important if lm right
lll be sacrificed
theyve gotta figure l told you
which means youll be sacrificed
yeah
lf anything happens to me
l want you to give that to lt briggs
okay
what happens if they get us both
then they win
lts not hard to understand
how this could happen the way things are
as incredible as it seems there may be
a suborganization within the police force
sort of a death squad
like they had in brazil some years back
damn
some nights l wake up wonder
where the hell the worlds going to
l want you to take care of yourself
you understand
hi
hi
jesus what happened to your face
nothing just a few stitches
l was going to the market
how about if l bring back a few beers
good l could use a beer right about now
lve got your key so lll get your mail too
all right baby
keep it warm
do you have any idea how hard it is
to prosecute a cop
you heroes have killed
a dozen people this week
what are you gonna do next week
kill a dozen more
ls that what you guys are all about
being heroes
all our heroes are dead
we are the first generation
thats learned to fight
were simply ridding society
of killers that would be caught
and sentenced anyway
if our courts worked properly
we began with the criminals
that the people know
so that our actions would be understood
lts not just a question
of whether or not to use violence
there simply is no other way lnspector
you of all people
should understand that
either youre for us or youre against us
lm afraid youve misjudged me
hi sunny
hi sue
no no
harry what are you doing
hey whats going on down here
lm taking the mailbox apart
what does it look like
you people live here dont you
yeah
what are you doing to the mailbox
did you lose you key
why dont you mind
your own goddamn business
thats my mailbox too
dont you get smart with me
tampering with the mail
is a federal offense
lm calling the police
l am the police
what
the cop that lives upstairs
whats that
plastic explosive
a bomb
thats right
lf youd bothered me any more
wed all be stuck to the ceiling
do you want to hold it
no l dont want to get involved
go to your apartment and stay there
dont open for anybody
homicide lt briggs
lnspector callahan calling
callahan where are you
look briggs
l just found a bomb in my mailbox
l want you to get a man
over to earlys house right away
what
lve got a bomb right here
now get a man over to earlys
you hear me

stay right where you are
lll be down there myself
dont move
yeah
come on in
l dont like looking down one of those
wheres the bomb
right on the dresser
all right lets get out of here
avery will want to see this
you mind driving
l want to take a closer look at this thing
this thing could be activated
by your mailbox key
or by a timer
turn right here
get on the freeway
the freeway
you got a new route to city hall
lieutenant
your guns out of its holster briggs
first time
you know youre not going to city hall
the only way youre going anywhere
is in a rubber bag
let me have your gun
now the shells
three you always carry three
throw them out the window
how do you figure on pulling this off
briggs
l run the investigation with your record
l can make anything stick
what l cant understand is
why you of all people
a hundred years ago in this city
people did the same thing
history justified the vigilantes
were no different
anyone who threatens the security
of the people will be executed
evil for evil harry retribution
thats just fine
but how does murder fit in
when police start becoming
their own executioners
wheres it gonna end briggs
pretty soon youll start executing people
for jaywalking
and executing people for traffic violations
then you end up executing your neighbor
cause his dog pisses on your lawn
there isnt one man weve killed that
didnt deserve what was coming to him
yes there is charlie mccoy
what would you have done
ld have upheld the law
what the hell do you know about the law
youre a great cop harry
you had a chance to join the team
but youd rather stick to the system
briggs l hate the goddamn system
but until someone comes along
with some changes that make sense
lll stick with it
youre about to become extinct
get off at the next exit
red
red
briggs was right
you guys dont have enough experience
just hold it right there callahan
no tricks
your organizations through briggs
theres a lot more where they came from
believe me
move out of the way move it
uphold the law
you just killed three police officers harry
and the only reason
lm not gonna kill you
is because lm gonna prosecute you
with your own system
ltll be my word against yours
