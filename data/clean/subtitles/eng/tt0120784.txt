did you hurt her 
the hooker 
did you hurt her 
what does that have to do
with anything 
i ve got a few minutes 
so go boil an egg 
phillip says you have a problem
you need help with 
yes  sir 
is it your problem     
     who breached our security
last night 
he breaks into my apartment  
there s an old expression
that has served me well 
  do not shit where you eat    
or   live    
  do not shit where you live    
i like that better 
i m sorry  mr  carter 
there are three ways
we can handle this 
one  we help you 
two  we allow you to help yourself 
three  we have you replaced 
we have an investment in you  resnick 
of time  money and training 
so assisting you would be     
     in a way  protecting our investment 
that is good business policy 
yes  sir  mr  carter 
thank you 
you won t regret it 
according to phillip 
a man has come to kill you 
he s alone and he s
a professional robber  correct 
yes  sir  he does payroll jobs 
banks  stuff like that 
 what s his name 
 porter 
what s his first name 
i don t know  he never called
himself anything but porter 
where did you get the  1 30 000 
that s why this man is in town 
the  1 30 000 you paid us back 
yes  sir 
but only  70 000 of it was his 
we never asked you where you got it 
it s none of our business 
now it appears
it has become our business 
here s his file  mr  carter 
do you understand your value
to the organization 
you re a sadist  you lack compunction 
that comes in handy 
but now  an area of your personal life
has become a danger to us 
a man in our organization needs
to be tough  self reliant 
were you to handle this problem
on your own     
     there would be no doubt     
     you re the man we want 
i want to 
i want to handle it myself 
great 
until it is handed  i want you
to move out of the oakwood 
i don t have a place       
no more unpleasantness at the hotel 
yes  sir 
it might be easier
if resnick just disappeared 
i thought about that 
i m not worried about resnick 
he wouldn t last two minutes
without us 
it s that other mutt
i m thinking about 
 what s his name 
 porter 
takes a lot of moxie to walk in
and whack our guys around 
either that or he s shit nuts 
frankly  i don t understand it
for  1 30 000 
it was  70 000  his share 
that s even worse 
i don t want
mr  bronson hearing about this 
he ll think i m getting soft 
his principle has always been 
  if you don t understand it 
get rid of it    
a stitch in time  so to speak 
stitch this mutt up  phil 
any polaroids or trophies 
no  not this time 
they cut me loose  pearl 
like i thought they would 
hold on one second 
shut up 
i m on the fucking phone 
yes 
did your friends make it to town 
last night  baby 
did you tell them
porter took their payroll 
i did 
and they want retribution 
all right  here s what we do 
yeah  that s porter 
he has shit for brains 
shit 
shit 
next time  porter 
porter s made some new friends 
 easy  mister 
 i won t press charges 
 who were they 
 i don t know 
it s you guys 
stegman says you got
a line on a load of cash 
240 grand  to be exact 
seventy 
come on  man  get off of me 
what do you take us for 
idiots 
nobody d do this shit for 70 grand 
you look like a whole bunch
of trouble to us 
we found a dead girl full of heroin 
there were signs of a struggle 
we re not sure it was an o d 
we got a witness 
a guy with one nostril 
remember him 
don t worry 
we ll give you immunity 
room to operate 
get out of jail free card 
all you got to do is get the money 
we can t help you  though 
 it would be against the law 
 understand 
 it s my money 
 wrong 
it s our money 
you be a good boy  we give you a piece 
it ll be easy  porter 
you got it 
 he s got it 
 understand 
 we ll be in touch 
 sure 
what a dope 
fuck 
crooked cops 
do they come any other way 
if i d been just a little dumber 
i could ve joined the force myself 
jesus christ 
you need to see a doctor 
 it s going to sting 
 just clean it up  all right 
you hold it there 
i ll do it 
tell me something  porter 
when did you decide to leave 
that night we slept together 
no 
the next day 
when i drove you to work 
you could ve asked me to quit 
you could ve asked me
to drive you somewhere else 
hubba  hubba  hubba 
thanks 
does it fit 
like it was made for me 
it ll look great in your casket 
you know what i think
