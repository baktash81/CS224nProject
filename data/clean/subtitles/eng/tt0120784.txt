did you hurt her
the hooker
did you hurt her
what does that have to do
with anything
ive got a few minutes
so go boil an egg
phillip says you have a problem
you need help with
yes sir
is it your problem
who breached our security
last night
he breaks into my apartment
theres an old expression
that has served me well
do not shit where you eat
or live
do not shit where you live
i like that better
im sorry mr carter
there are three ways
we can handle this
one we help you
two we allow you to help yourself
three we have you replaced
we have an investment in you resnick
of time money and training
so assisting you would be
in a way protecting our investment
that is good business policy
yes sir mr carter
thank you
you wont regret it
according to phillip
a man has come to kill you
hes alone and hes
a professional robber correct
yes sir he does payroll jobs
banks stuff like that
whats his name
porter
whats his first name
i dont know he never called
himself anything but porter
where did you get the 1 30000
thats why this man is in town
the 1 30000 you paid us back
yes sir
but only 70000 of it was his
we never asked you where you got it
its none of our business
now it appears
it has become our business
heres his file mr carter
do you understand your value
to the organization
youre a sadist you lack compunction
that comes in handy
but now an area of your personal life
has become a danger to us
a man in our organization needs
to be tough selfreliant
were you to handle this problem
on your own
there would be no doubt
youre the man we want
i want to
i want to handle it myself
great
until it is handed i want you
to move out of the oakwood
i dont have a place
no more unpleasantness at the hotel
yes sir
it might be easier
if resnick just disappeared
i thought about that
im not worried about resnick
he wouldnt last two minutes
without us
its that other mutt
im thinking about
whats his name
porter
takes a lot of moxie to walk in
and whack our guys around
either that or hes shit nuts
frankly i dont understand it
for 1 30000
it was 70000 his share
thats even worse
i dont want
mr bronson hearing about this
hell think im getting soft
his principle has always been
if you dont understand it
get rid of it
a stitch in time so to speak
stitch this mutt up phil
any polaroids or trophies
no not this time
they cut me loose pearl
like i thought they would
hold on one second
shut up
im on the fucking phone
yes
did your friends make it to town
last night baby
did you tell them
porter took their payroll
i did
and they want retribution
all right heres what we do
yeah thats porter
he has shit for brains
shit
shit
next time porter
porters made some new friends
easy mister
i wont press charges
who were they
i dont know
its you guys
stegman says you got
a line on a load of cash
