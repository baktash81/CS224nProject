and forgets the blood 
 whatever history remembers of me 
if it remembers anything at all   
 it shall only be a 
fraction of the truth 
 for whatever else i am 
a husband  a lawyer   
 a president   
 i shall always think of myself
as a man who struggled against darkness 
 i leave in your trusted hands 
my dear friend henry   
 this record that begins
when i was just a boy  
get on down there  hurry it up 
please  sir  no 
there s been some kind of mistake 
i ain t no slave 
let them go  aaron 
go back inside 
let them go 
will 
  quiet 
  he s my friend 
look away  abraham 
it s not our place 
look away 
abraham 
thomas  help them 
leave him alone 
are you all right 
did you strike my friend here 
he was beating my son 
did you strike him  lincoln 
they re not slaves  and you know it 
i suggest you get back to your work
before you find yourself
led away in chains 
until every man is free 
we are all slaves 
very well  then 
since you re all so 
concerned with freedom   
you may consider yourself free
from the burden of my employ 
and the debt you ve been working off   
i d like it paid in full with interest 
now  please 
if you get one more penny
from me  mr  barts   
it will come with a fist
wrapped around it 
all right  mr  lincoln 
there are other ways to collect a debt 
no 
what s happening to her  father 
please help her 
please  i beg of you 
you ve got to do something  father 
easy  child 
look away  abraham 
i ve never seen anything like this 
strange 
you promise me 
let s step outside 
i m sorry  i don t know what ails her 
abraham 
come and lie next to me 
i ve been writing  mama 
 days are swift as an indian arrow   
 flying like a shooting star 
 the present day is here   
 and then slides away in haste   
 that we can never say is ours   
 but only say   
 is passed   
mother 
mother 
lincoln narrating   mama once told me 
that i hadn t cried when i was born 
 that i d simply opened my eyes   
 looked at her smiling face   
and smiled back 
 my light was gone  
  i don t know how he did it 
  abraham   
you promise me   
you promise me you won t go
and do anything foolish 
lincoln continues   nine years later 
my father joined her in death 
 no longer bound by my promise   
 i tried to fortify the nerve
to pursue my vengeance  
haven t you had enough 
a boy only gets this drunk when
he wants to kiss a girl   
or kill a man 
adam  let me explain 
last one  barts 
i m not coming up here to clean up
your messes anymore 
yes  sir  i promise 
every so often  i think about what
it would be like to be in the south 
so  where s henry 
yes  sir 
we ve been looking all over  sir 
searching high and low 
low is more likely 
just find him  barts 
oh  and send a fresh crop south 
we have a lot of mouths to feed 
yes  sir 
 yes  sir  no  sir 
high  sir  low  sir   
for my mother 
that was unlucky 
might have put me out of my misery 
where the hell are you running to 
don t much like chasing chickens 
little boy  all grown up 
come to avenge his dear momma 
there are two kinds of men  mr  lincoln 
those that have the guts
to pull the trigger   
and those who do not 
powder  patch  ball 
don t mess it up 
you weren t asleep that night 
were you 
you dropped the ball  mr  lincoln 
your mama s blood was sickening sweet 
i hope yours tastes better 
 hears woman screaming 
might i suggest that we begin by   
closing the door 
yeah  i m sorry 
i didn t see anything 
should we dive right in 
or are you finding gabrielle s
egress too distracting 
i m sorry  sir  but who are you 
who i am is henry sturges 
and where you are is my home 
and what happened   
i saved your life   
during your rather pathetic attempt
at taking another s 
what were you doing there  and   
how did you know
i would try to kill barts 
how 
i watched this boy carry out
his first long awaited mission 
drunk  might i add 
and i think   you have wasted
your time watching this one  henry 
 he s not a promising recruit 
 he is just a selfish boy
with his heart set on vengeance   
and i realized 
 this boy is a goddamned idiot  
 i doubt he even knew
his target was a vampire   
a vampire 
yes  immortal  blood sucking demons 
fortunately for you  mr  lincoln   
hunting them is something of a hobby 
but vampires are just myths 
myths don t beat you senseless
after you ve put
a bullet in their brain 
thank you 
no  mr  lincoln 
vampires are real 
they exist in every city
and every state   
in the union 
if what you say is true 
you could help me kill him 
i could pay you to kill him 
my services are not for sale 
and the word you are looking for
is  destroy  
it is quite a feat to kill that
which is already dead 
but you don t understand 
my mother was murdered 
and if i teach you how
to murder her murderer   
so what 
how will that honor her memory 
how will that benefit the next boy
whose mother is taken 
if vengeance is all you seek   
seek it elsewhere 
teach me to fight as you do 
please  i ll do anything you say 
you promise to cast aside
all notions of vengeance   
and commit to the life of a hunter 
you will have no friends   
no family 
lincoln narrating   i told him 
what he wanted to hear 
 but all i cared about was killing
 the monster that took my mother  
i m in 
scottish highland pistol 
and if one barrel isn t enough   
seven should do you 
the blunderbuss 
and if you lose your ball   
you can always stuff your pocket watch
down the end of it 
so  abe   
which one takes your fancy 
actually  i haven t had the 
best of luck with shooting irons 
but   
i was a rail splitter 
i would like you to chop this tree down
with a single swing 
that tree 
it s got to be more than a foot across 
that s impossible 
but it isn t a tree 
it s what you hate most in the world 
so  tell me  mr  lincoln   
what do you hate 
i hate jack barts 
then strike him down 
well  clearly you don t
hate him that much 
tell me what you hate 
i hate that my mother was taken away 
inadequate 
i hate that we were afraid 
and 
that my mother and father 
everyone that we knew   
lived in fear 
pathetic 
i hate that i was too small 
  too weak 
  yes 
  and that you failed   
  yes 
      to protect her 
  yes 
and that you let her die 
yaaahhh   
power  lincoln   
real power   
comes not from hate 
but from truth 
before you protect others
from darkness   
you must first be able
to protect yourself 
your enemies have the power
to render themselves invisible 
you must have the ability
to fight blind 
to see  without seeing 
 the sounds of punches  bodies falling 
again 
lincoln   in the weeks that followed   
 henry endeavored to impart a lifetime
of vampire hunting secrets 
 their ability to adapt to sunlight 
 their power to render
themselves invisible 
 but most of all  he taught 
me how to destroy them  
when judas betrayed jesus   
his reward was 30 pieces of silver 
at that moment  those pieces
became a symbol of betraying god 
of evil 
and silver became a curse   
upon the cursed 
you will never see a vampire
with silver on his person 
nor see them reflected in mirrors 
the one thing god placed
beyond the reach of a vampire 
the one thing he can never possess 
barts 
and the only thing that
renders him powerless 
henry  jack barts 
i give you the targets 
that was our deal 
this is not only
about jack barts 
vadoma  a ruthless enforcer 
and her brother 
i ve seen him before 
i saw him with jack barts 
they call him adam 
he  from whom all others are made 
vampires have been in
the new world for centuries 
slaughtering native tribes
and early settlers 
but when the europeans
arrived with their slaves   
the dead saw a sinister opportunity 
they built an empire in the south 
but  in recent years 
they pressed north   
leaving death in their wake 
it falls to us  abraham   
the hunters 
to keep the balance 
to ensure that this remains
a nation of men   
and not monsters 
what we do 
we do not for one man   
but for the good of all mankind 
lincoln   henry sent me off into
the world with a reminder 
 no attachments 
no distractions 
 no friends or family 
 besides  who could i trust 
 anyone in this well mannered city
might very well be one of them  
son of a bitch 
if i ever see you here again 
i will have your balls as a coin purse 
good afternoon  sir 
joshua speed at your service 
abraham    ah  lincoln 
i need a bit of help 
all right 
well  a friend in need
is a friend of speed 
what can i get for you 
i don t suppose you know
of any rooms for rent  mr  speed 
what sort of room are
you looking for  mr  lincoln 
well  a cheap one   
as i have spent all of my money
on law books
and have none to spare at the moment 
now  as you say you have none 
am i to take your meaning as  cheap    
or  free of charge  
well  on credit 
i don t think you ll find
such a room in springfield 
people here are strangely
accustomed to being compensated 
good day 
there is one room  mr  lincoln 
i was recently forced to part ways
with a thieving prick of an associate   
and am  therefore 
in need of a replacement 
there s a room upstairs 
it isn t much  but i suppose
it could be had on credit   
if the tenant were willing
to work here in return 
lincoln writing   dear henry   
 life in springfield is
less than desirous 
 fear not 
 my pittance of a salary doesn t allow me
to deviate from your rules   
 no friends  no family 
 and certainly  no woman would find me 
and my existence  enticing  
excuse me 
excuse me 
i ll be needing these 
just one second  ma am 
well  you needn t call me ma am
as if i m some haggard spinster  
i m sorry  ma am 
madam    i mean  miss 
i m abraham    ah  lincoln 
mary todd 
darling 
there you are 
you mustn t flit from
store to store so quickly 
well  perhaps if you didn t stop to jaw
with every gentleman in springfield   
i could say the same for you 
stephen douglas 
how do you do 
abraham    lincoln 
are you a voting man  mr  lincoln 
i   
how do you feel about
keeping slavery out of illinois 
i m running for the legislature 
i m sure he d love to hear
your campaign speech   
but mr  lincoln was just about
to attend to my list 
we were talking  dear 
slavery  it s a complicated issue 
i couldn t disagree with you more 
mr  douglas 
mr  douglas  miss todd 
you have met my new associate  abraham 
a letter came for you 
sturges   dear abe 
 your prescription awaits you
at the local pharmacy 
 ask for aaron stibel  junior  
mr  lincoln 
i m so sorry 
good day of work  abraham 
thank you 
sturges   but don t forget   
always have a contingency plan  
aaron stibel junior 
yes 
that s it  oh  that s tight 
don t worry  it will only 
hurt for a second or two 
did you eat today 
lincoln   i had killed a monster 
 and i would kill again 
 but no amount of death
could make me forget  
merciful christ  lincoln 
what happened to your face 
don t worry  i ll still be able to work 
work 
to hell with work 
we got invited to a ball 
it could be your chance to save
mary todd from a life of boredom 
this suit makes me look ridiculous 
nonsense 
but that hat makes you look ridiculous 
come on 
come on  come on 
look  there she is 
mr  douglas  joshua speed 
pleasure to see you 
mary  you look lovely 
he s still missing 
who s that 
aaron stibel 
junior or senior 
ah  junior 
  who is that man 
  i don t know 
mr  douglas  you know senator nolan 
of course 
ah yes  stephen  good to see you 
have you heard this news 
ah yes  yes  we re looking into it 
rest assured  this kind of lawlessness   
won t stand in the 
noble state of illinois 
it s called a dance 
if we were meant to sit alone 
they would ve called it something else 
yes  i suppose they would have 
come  mr  lincoln 
you ll ruin the upholstery
if you sit there any longer 
i m sure you re a very nice man 
mr  lincoln   
but you re a   
a shopkeeper  in a borrowed suit 
no  it s not a matter of means 
really  no 
i came to springfield
looking for someone different 
someone whose life was a 
bit more adventurous  and well   
my apologies  i m never this 
honest 
rude 
miss todd  may i speak candidly 
i  too  came here to better myself 
that s why i ve taken an interest
in the law   
and why  if i may be so bold 
i have taken an interest in you 
and as for the adventure
that you seek   
i suspect that few men
could ever hope to provide that for you 
least of all your fiancé
stephen douglas 
mr  lincoln  you are full of surprises 
miss todd  you have no idea 
sturges   dear abraham   
 i ve made a deposit at the local bank 
 be careful  it can quickly disappear  
lincoln writing   henry  there are 
more than i ever thought possible   
 pharmacists  innkeepers  pastors 
 it s more than a man can bear  
well  i see i m
such interesting company 
i m sorry 
i ve been working nights 
really  is that true 
do you really want
to know the truth  mary 
each and every night   
i go out   
hunting vampires 
well  how do you hunt these vampires 
with an axe 
a special silver axe  of course 
of course 
and how many would
you reckon you ve killed 
five  no    six 
i have killed six vampires 
my goodness 
abe 
here i thought you were an honest man 
really 
 lincoln making barking noises 
raf  raf  raf    raf  raf 
well  i had a wonderful day  abe 
as did i  mary 
miss todd  you are a woman
of ravishing resourcefulness 
mr  lincoln  you have no idea 
sturges   you will have no friends  
no family  
i  ah    should be going  it s late 
lincoln   how could i bring her into this world 
 a world of demons  of danger  
good night  then  lincoln 
good night  mary 
happy hunting 
lincoln   if i truly cared for her   
 the kindest thing i could do   
 was walk away  
this hunter is another 
of henry s disciples 
they say he s a madman 
i can t wait to meet him 
a stock boy  reading a law book 
  what 
  you studying to be a lawyer 
as a matter of fact  i am 
all right  what about a little test 
what s the law for free slaves
in the north 
according to the
fugitive slave act of 1793   
enforcing article four  section two 
of the united states constitution   
 all runaway slaves must
be returned to their owners   
however  personal liberty 
laws state that   
 anyone who is born free   
 cannot be taken under this act   
i heard a good woman once say   
 until all men are free   
 we re all slaves   
will 
will johnson 
how did you    
i was back home   
and heard you moved here 
studying to be a lawyer 
that s good  i m in 
need of a good lawyer 
what  are you in some kind of trouble 
i was freeing slaves down south
on the railroad   
hoping to find my brother down there 
some bounty hunters got after me 
said i was a runaway 
i need a writ  abe   
saying i was born free 
you know  will   
come on 
hey 
speed  this is will johnson 
will johnson  my oldest 
cousin in the world 
the store isn t going 
to run itself  abe 
i ll have him back as soon as 
possible  mistah    speed 
i promise 
you re getting tall  abe 
look like you still
don t eat much  either 
you still afraid of the dark  too 
not so much anymore 
that s him  abe 
that s the guy that s been chasing me 
gentlemen  gentlemen  gentlemen   
i m sure we can work this out 
now i suggest you walk away  son 
no  sir  i suggest you do 
i ve sent word to senator nolan 
he ll have you out soon 
you re far too kind  miss todd 
and he s far too ugly
to have a woman like you 
i think common looking people
are the best in the world 
that s why the lord
makes so many of them 
i just thank god he was there 
but i won t always be there 
mary   
what if something was going on 
something terrible   
and you knew that there was no way
on earth that one man could stop it 
what would you do 
well   
i wouldn t back away from what s right
just because it s hard 
my father used to say 
 plant your feet and stand firm 
 the only question is
where to put your feet   
we may fail in this fight 
we may only shatter
the tranquil veil of oppression   
but we must not be deterred 
for ours is a just and noble cause 
the cause of freedom 
the very cause upon which
our founding fathers built   
this great nation 
a voice like that is too strong
to be stuck keeping shop 
i m actually studying to be a lawyer 
well  mr  lincoln  maybe it s time
you thought about politics 
i can connect you with the right people 
thank you  senator nolan 
  a pleasure young man 
  the same 
you re on your way  mr  lincoln 
i sent you to springfield
to hunt vampires   
not to chase votes 
lesson one  always have 
a contingency plan 
if vampire hunting doesn t pan out   
i need a career to fall back on 
i m being serious 
so am i  henry 
i have done everything
you ve asked of me 
every letter  every name   
but never the letter i wait for 
and never the name i want most 
when do i get to kill jack barts 
barts knows about mary 
it s time 
abraham   
be careful 
abraham fucking linc   
yaah 
missed again 
i hope you re better with an axe
than you were with a gun 
come on  lincoln 
catch me before i get to mary 
catch me if you can  boy 
there s thousands of us here 
he won t stop until this 
whole country is ours 
and they ll be coming for you now 
ask your friend  henry 
you shut your mouth  you stupid whore 
give me what i need  or 
i ll knock your teeth out 
you lying son of a bitch 
god damn it 
no  abe  stop 
you weren t ready to know 
what  that you are a vampire 
you are not the only one   
who has lost everything to vampires 
just because the carriage stops   
doesn t mean we have to 
get in the carriage 
take this 
run  just run 
aaaahhhh   
her soul was pure 
but yours  henry   
it s one of god s little tricks 
vampires cannot kill their own kind 
only the living can kill the dead 
welcome to the family 
you can t save the world 
and the ones you love  lincoln 
you need to make a choice 
i m sorry   
but goodbye 
yah 
abe 
mary 
what on earth are you doing 
come on in 
  what are you hiding 
  nothing 
abe 
it s nothing 
abe  i know when you re lying 
what are you hiding from me 
all right 
i didn t want to tell you this way 
this is not the way that i planned it 
but if you really must know   
mary todd   
will you make me the happiest of men 
and do you  abraham   
promise to love her 
comfort her   
be honorable and honest
with her in all things   
in sickness and health   
till death do you part 
i do 
then by the power vested
in me by almighty god   
and the great state of illinois   
i now pronounce you   
man and wife 
you may kiss the bride 
your mother would be so proud 
thank you  will 
i m happy you could be here 
you re the only family i have 
except for this one 
congratulations 
may i introduce mr  henry sturges 
my wife  mary 
and my dear friend  will johnson 
heavens  mr  sturges  you re 
as chilly as the winter wind 
henry  please 
i m afraid that s a hazard
of carrying one s own bottle 
well  you know what they say 
 cold hands  warm heart   
yes  but i highly doubt that 
mr  sturges is a business associate 
yes  i thought we could 
talk a little business 
of course 
if you ll excuse me 
what the hell are you doing here 
be cautious  abraham 
one forgets how easily we can lose
the most precious things 
they don t even know who i am 
go upriver 
invite this mr  lincoln
to join us at the plantation 
we re going to throw a ball
in his honor 
what makes you think he ll accept 
i think we can find a way to tempt him 
it s a good book  it s good 
get him 
abe 
we ve got a problem 
they took will 
what are you going to do 
i m going to accept his invitation 
lincoln   speed deserved to know the truth
of what we were about to face 
 i told him everything 
 not knowing if he would believe me
or think me mad 
 not knowing if he would have the courage
to face the monsters   
 that i had come to know  
you and me  abraham 
together we can accomplish anything 
there are no slaves 
where are they 
i was just wondering that 
something isn t right about this  abe 
yeah 
i don t know how to dance 
don t worry  i ll teach you 
wait here 
ladies and gentlemen   
dinner is served 
bravo  mr  lincoln 
bravo  you re even 
better than i d heard 
a shame to sacrifice
so many of my best men   
but i needed to know
if you re up to the task 
what do you want with me 
to see you liberated 
to see you rise up and 
destroy your oppressor 
that s interesting advice 
coming from a slave owner 
men have enslaved each other   
since they invented gods
to forgive them for doing it 
i ve seen jews build egypt s glory 
seen christians   
thrown to lions with my own eyes 
and i ve seen africans
sell their own kind to europeans
may i share one of the revelations
of my 5 000 years 
we re all slaves to something 
i  to eternity 
you  to your convictions 
others  to the color of their skin 
all i ever wanted   
was to see my kind
granted their rightful place 
but there are those of us 
those like your friend henry   
who enjoy living in the dark 
and as you re doubtless aware   
i cannot personally destroy him 
nor he i 
you  mr  lincoln   
you could eliminate those
last pockets of resistance   
beginning with henry sturges himself 
all i ask   
is for you to break your chains 
kill your master 
be free 
and if i refuse 
then you go on your merry way 
after i make you one of us  and   
spoon feed you your friend 
now  a simple  yes  or  no 
will suffice 
kill henry   
save your friend 
feel free to take your time to decide 
five   
four   
three   
two   
one 
speed from a distance   c mon  yeah 
get up   horse whinnies 
come on 
this way 
miss tubman  miss tubman 
we ve been waiting for you 
come quickly 
people getting killed every day 
slaves disappearing 
some people talk
about monsters and demons 
  good morning 
  good morning 
how can i assist you
on this beautiful day 
we re looking for three men 
you know  i did see someone
run down that way 
 ding  
you re welcome to come in if you like 
our service is about to begin 
right  let s keep going 
i take it y all came from up north 
yes  ma am 
well  i suggest you get back there
as fast as you can 
there s a war coming 
a war for the soul of the country 
going to be all colors of blood spilled 
our nation was built
on the backs of slaves
their labor  their blood 
more blood than you 
could possibly imagine 
i have seen this horror
of the south firsthand 
i say the need for peace
outweighs the needs of the blacks 
i say that if the people
of this great nation want slavery   
then let them have it 
the demon of slavery
is tearing our country apart 
we must stand up 
we must stand strong and fight 
fight for the very soul of our nation 
until every man is free 
we are all slaves 
you cannot take on slavery  abraham 
you cannot take on the whole south 
  why  because of adam 
  no 
are you afraid of him 
because it is the only thing that has
kept them sated for all these years   
and you take that away 
then no one is safe 
so you get to choose
who lives and who dies 
a great man once said   
 what we do 
we do not for ourselves   
 not for one man 
but for the good of all mankind  
not all mankind  abraham 
abe 
may i have my husband back 
he s all yours  mrs  lincoln 
lincoln   henry only saw the 
struggle his way 
 but i began at last to see it another 
 to see and to feel
the even greater issues at stake 
 so  he and i would go our separate ways 
 as the bible says   
 the time had come for me
to put aside childish things
 i would fight not with an ax   
 but with words and ideals 
 for a time   
 they proved a stronger weapon  
crowd chanting   lincoln  lincoln 
 lincoln     
in compliance with a custom as 
old as the government itself  
i appear before you to take 
in your presence   
the oath prescribed by
the constitution of the united states   
to be taken by the president   
before he enters on
the execution of this office 
the question of slavery is better settled
with a pen than with a sword 
fire 
lincoln   through twists of fate   
 i found my self at 50 years of age   
 the father of a nation that
was tearing itself apart   
 while trying to be
the father to a boy   
 not much older than i was
when i lost my mother  
three thousand more dead 
when s the last time
you had something to eat 
i m not hungry  thank you 
you have got to eat  abe 
you re only human 
come along  willie 
willie 
willie 
if you do this  there is 
no turning back  abe 
i know 
i m trying to protect the freedom
of a nation 
lincoln   if this war is truly a stand
against evil   
 then let it stand for something 
 if it is a war for the freedom of man   
 why not give all men
a reason to fight it  
 all persons held as slaves   
 within any state
or designated part of a state   
 the people whereof
shall be in rebellion
 against the united states
shall be then   
     and henceforward shall be free  
good morning 
precious little one   
what s your name 
willie 
and your father  what s his 
abraham 
 inaudible dialog 
what a beautiful silver sword 
how is our little soldier faring 
i ve never seen anything like it 
i m sorry 
i don t know what ails your boy 
abe 
mary s calling for you 
i m so sorry  abraham 
why didn t they take me 
because they know   
it is a fate much worse than death 
mary   
is inconsolable 
she says she doesn t want
to go on without him 
there is a way  abraham 
you know that i can restore the dead 
do it 
do it 
mary   
do it 
your journal   
the one you always
kept in your coat pocket   
i know i shouldn t have  abe  but
i needed to know what you were hiding 
if what you say is true   
i beg you   
give us our little boy back 
mary  he wouldn t be our little boy 
he would be something else 
something terrible 
trust me  you don t want that 
you re asking me to trust you 
after you lied to me
for all these years 
i did it to protect you 
to protect our family 
and how did that work out 
you did this  abe 
you did this 
you brought this on him 
you brought this on our boy 
let me go to them 
make a truce with adam 
we must stop this war 
willie s death is just the beginning 
don t you dare say his name 
i warned you 
you didn t heed me 
how many more boys will have to die
before you listen to me 
these boys are dying in vain 
we should pull the troops back 
abraham  this war has 
cost us countless lives   
not to mention millions of dollars 
i thought we were going
to make this country great   
not tear it apart 
this is the only way we can 
save the country now  speed 
send in troops 
union troops are flooding
onto the field 
we are now outnumbered   
and ill equipped compared to the north 
we will support you   
but you will need to support us 
no  thank you 
rest assured  mr  davis   
you ll have as many of my kind
as you need 
fire 
fire 
ready 
aim 
here they come 
fire 
why did they drop their rifles 
fire 
it s the first day of gettysburg 
it s been a disaster 
i don t think the army
can survive another 
if the rebels break through 
they ll be here    in days 
the generals think we 
should evacuate washington 
run the war from new york or   
boston  if need be 
you have to win this war 
if you don t  then all of it   
then our son s death
will have been for nothing 
how can i win a war   
when i can t even protect my own family 
our men have no way of defending
themselves against this enemy 
when our bullets are useless  our 
bayonets are powerless as this fork 
this   
will 
speed 
this  this is what we need 
a fork 
silver 
okay  okay 
how much do we need 
all of it 
and why tell me this  mr  speed 
why betray your friend 
he is my friend  but i 
love this country even more 
and he  more than anyone  is responsible
for tearing this nation apart 
you ve done the right thing 
i know 
32  33  34  35   
that is a lot of silver  abe 
now  how are we going to
get all this there 
i m sorry  mary 
i m sorry i ve kept you 
in the dark all these years 
i need you  mary 
i ve waited a long time
to hear you say those words 
i want you to leave washington  mary 
miss tubman 
please have some tea 
i very much appreciate you coming
to speak with me today 
oh  yes 
things have not been easy 
what with my   
the death of my son and the war 
i need to get out of washington 
and i need a lot of help 
this war ends tonight 
and with it   
our millennia of darkness 
we have to do this on our own 
no one can know what s on that train 
if we don t get those weapons
to those boys at gettysburg   
the war is over 
it s time we had a nation of our own 
come   
we have a train to catch 
it s 80 miles from here to gettysburg 
eighty miles will decide whether
this nation belongs to the living   
or the dead 
is everything all right  speed 
i just can t believe
you re still writing in that book 
it s all in here  speed 
the good with the bad 
what s this 
they re fleeing the nest 
leaving washington free for us 
look at me 
i said look at me 
 train whistles in the distance 
leave her 
don t want to miss this train 
let s go 
henry  what the hell are you doing here 
i just wanted to see how far 
your foolishness would take you 
i don t have time to argue 
i didn t come here to argue with you 
i came here to tell you that
your dear friend speed back there   
is a traitor 
he betrayed you  abe 
speed is leading you 
you have no idea
what you re talking about 
that s all according to plan 
 hears thumping on the roof 
you must get off this train 
no  you must get off this train 
this is not your war  henry 
they re here  abe 
a whole heap of them 
we can t let them stop this train 
you go through there
and you re dead 
get out now 
it s your last chance 
did you load that thing 
we ve got to keep them
away from the locomotive 
why don t you let him go  lincoln 
emancipate yourselves 
i will never follow you 
you don t have to follow me  abe 
i have the train 
i have the silver 
soon i ll have the whole country 
i m going to destroy the 
myth of abraham lincoln   
so that history will forever know you
not as a man   
but as a monster 
 sturges starts laughing 
lincoln set us up 
we ve been tricked  adam 
there is no silver on this train 
abe 
abe 
abe 
hello  speed 
where is the silver 
silver 
should be here 
why did you lie to me 
to get you all in one place   
to finish you 
speed 
nooooo   
mr  president 
there is nowhere left to run  lincoln 
where is it 
where is the silver 
right here 
thank you  henry 
i suppose some vampires can be trusted 
as can some men  abraham 
if the train was a decoy   
where is the silver 
this isn t the only railroad 
a wise man once taught me   
 always have a contingency plan  
get me more 
bayonets 
bayonets for springfield muskets 
springfield muskets 
five pounders and grenades are in
the second wagon in the back 
go now  go now 
fire 
lincoln   four score and seven years ago   
 our fathers brought forth
on this continent   
 a new nation conceived in liberty   
 and dedicated to the proposition   
 that all men are created equal 
 now we are engaged
in a great civil war   
 testing whether that nation
or any nation   
 so conceived and so dedicated   
 can long endure 
 it is for us  the living  rather   
 to be dedicated here   
 to the unfinished work
which they who fought here   
 have thus far so nobly advanced 
 it is rather for us
to be here dedicated   
 to the great task remaining before us   
 that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause   
 for which they gave the 
last full measure of devotion   
 that we here highly resolve
that these dead   
 shall not have died in vain   
 and that this nation  under god   
 shall have a new birth of freedom   
 and that government   
 of the people  by the people 
for the people   
 shall not perish from the earth  
lincoln   our enemies have made their exodus 
 some back to europe   
 some to south america and the orient 
 they ve seen that america shall
forever be a nation of living men   
 a nation of free men  
we make rather a good team 
you and i 
one can t help but think of all the good
we could do if we had more time 
limitless time 
mary  lincoln 
yes  well  time waits for no man 
we re going to be late for the theatre 
hold onto this for me  henry 
mary  darling   
have you seen my hat 
it s on your desk in the office 
have you seen my hat 
abraham  let me make you immortal 
let us fight through the ages 
side by side 
vampires are not the only 
things that live forever 
sturges   history prefers legends to men 
 it prefers nobility to brutality 
 soaring speeches to quiet deeds 
 history remembers the battle   
 and forgets the blood 
 however history remembers me 
if it does at all   
 it shall only remember
