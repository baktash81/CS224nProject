what he feels next is not guilt
but disappointment
it was not as wonderful as hed hoped
maybe next time it will be perfect
and as his determination builds
to take another life
he plans in obsessive detail
what props hell bring
what knots hell tie
let me ask you something
what turns you on
what really does it for you
is it a great body
is it a nice smile is it beautiful legs
what turns on a serial killer is the suffering
and death of a human being
now id like to ask you guys a favor
if you could all stand up
all the men in the room
please indulge me
come on its only fair
after all the time youve ogled us
now would everybody under 20
and over 35 have a seat
if you are of asian or africanamerican
descent you may sit down
kenny turn that light on please
so we can get a good look at these guys
ladies what do you see
some pretty cute guys dont you think
if one of these fellas asked you out
for a drink youd go
let me tell you something
nine out of ten serial killers
are white males
aged 20 to 35
just like these
albert desalvo bianchi and buono
berkowitz dahmer ted bundy
they were quiet unassuming
even nice
they had jobs
they made decent neighbors
their victims trusted them
the fbl estimates
there could be as many
as 35 serial killers
cruising for victims even as i speak
guys sit down youre scaring me
serial killers
are not a 20thcentury invention
but we are spawning them
in greater numbers
the state of florida
spent almost 8 million
to electrocute ted
youre dead
sorry
the state of florida spent 8 million
to electrocute ted bundy
wouldnt that money have been
better spent keeping him in jail
subject to intense scientific scrutiny
isnt our best hope to try to identify
the ted bundys of the future
before they kill
thank you

lnnocent blood is on these hands
i understand thats a terrible thing
but let me tell you
if you come back
ill make you stand in the corner again

i understand its terrible
you dont care about the truth
we pay for city government just like this
and you never care about the truth
i killed her
i know
i killed her in the bathtub
goodbye harvey
was it something i did in another life
probably something you did in this one
stuff came in from mercer
medical dental receipts
nothing in common with the others
whats that around your neck
id get one like yours
but i dont live near k mart
how about friends acquaintances
the only thing these girls had in common
is they all owned vibrators
the tool of survival
how can he come to work wearing that
lay off him
a cop should look like a cop
whats the world coming to
let me let you talk to the lead inspector
on the case
hold on
mj we got deep throat again
how many calls is that
that makes three today fourteen total
phone company set up on our centrex
yes this morning
have gigi put a tracer on her ass
ill see if itll work
lnspector monahan speaking homicide
ask her about the moon bike
im interested in your ideas
the moon bike
what is that
moon bike
i said a lunar cycle
i think he might be on a lunar cycle
because the first two murders
were 28 days apart
still want to crackjokes
no this is no joke neither is tying up
police lines with crank calls
are you calling me a crank
do you have any evidence to report
did you know the victims
this is number 3
that is an opinion not evidence
may i ask who im speaking with
whos helen hudson
what did you think of his claim
that he tied these women to a tree
and burned them alive
because joan of arc told him to
he was lying
how do you know
people suffering from aural hallucinations
hear voices in both ears
in stereo
daryll lee told me
joan of arc always appeared
on his left side
and spoke softly in his left ear
those are the lab results
hot off the press no sperm
weve got a serial
you didnt say that
you interviewed cullum three times
whos that
the woman that got the cop killed
she might be useful
that woman is a wrong number
work the clues for christs sake
what clues we dont have any clues
nobody here has ever worked
a serial case before
i have
the zodiac right
did anyone ever catch the zodiac
or did he die of old age
commissioners on 2
about the chinatown thing
work the clues
but what else
mr cullum satisfies the rules for sanity
in being fully aware
at the time of the murders
that his actions were wrong
and unlawful
thank you dr hudson
no more questions
san francisco homicide
im lnspector goetz

i talked to you this morning dr hudson
do you remember
of course i remember
theres nothing wrong with my memory
you called me a crank

daryll lee cullum was out of prison

im relieved
i hate to sound like a broken record
but you called us
i did im sorry it wont happen again
why
theres a serial killer out there whos
strangled three women hell do it again
if theres evidence connecting these
murders nothings been made public
how do you connect them
i dont know
twenty years of clinical experience

that i dont do this anymore
im retired
is that why you called us 14 times
cause youre retired
help me out i really admire your work
does she do this
wideeyedlittlegirl routine often
yeah
does it work
usually
sometimes
you can spare me the bullshit
you dont admire me or like me
none of your people do
but i dont give a fuck
thats the upside of a nervous breakdown
if you dont mind i have a very busy day
its a hell of an apartment you got here
i guess
the books you wrote
about these scumbags paid well
we cant afford to pay you
your usual fee
but if youd be so kind as to look
i dont want these here
would you be comfortable downtown
i dont want to see them here
ill drive you if you prefer
its all right its okay
just breathe im here
should we call the paramedics
no
its just a good oldfashioned panic attack
she hyperventilates till she faints then her
breathing gets normal and shes fine
what did we do
shes agoraphobic
shes afraid of spiders too
she hasnt left home in over a year
shes okay
shes fine ln half an hour
shell be singing
tell her
were sorry we bothered her
did you want her to look at those
if you do leave them
ill make sure theyre safe
tell her to call me
if she feels like it
that one is a strange ranger
quinn said she was a crackpot
he forgot to mention pillpopping
juicehead
hyperventilating agoraphobic asshole
i thought she was sweet
honest to god

all gone
i mustve looked like such an asshole
you look good with a bag on your head
oh god
i want to die
i wouldnt
hell be back

no i didnt i did not
you like those cute brutal types
with the eyebrows and the handcuffs
admit it
oh god
what whatd i say
nothing
i miss men
what am l
you know what i mean
i miss sex
he was pretty cute
yes he was very cute
no young cops for you
up you come sit over here

why are these here
ill get you some coffee

theyll find you years from now amongst
unopened mail and unread newspapers
yeah the old hermit lady
she lived on cat food and camembert
she used to be a really good shrink
make up your mind heres your coffee

you scared me
burning the midnight oil
this stuff never gets any easier
thats why they pay us the small bucks
do you
what would you think if
when youre finished here
we go to joes and we
have a steak and
i dont think so
thanks anyway
you got other plans
not that its any of my business
you got that right
bean curd smokedeel sushi
we got prawn tempura seaweed salad
you want to join us
you kiss your mother after eating that
no i can kiss you if you like
go fuck yourself
who put the bug up his ass
wheres my cheeseburger
i made an executive decision
japanese
its better for your heart
you didnt even get french fries
youre pissing me off
here here
any word from
helen paper bag hudson
not yet but there will be
no way
five bucks shes going to call tonight
deal
wait a minute
whats this quarter pounder
with cheese doing here
lnspector monahan please
these three are the work of the same man
this one is different
are you testing me
not exactly we had reason to believe
i have to take tests now
ongoing case
six months
the scene is disorganized
the killer lives nearby
he wouldve been too disoriented to drive
you have two possibilities one is
a mental patient the other is a boyfriend
someone who was denied sex
on this occasion
who knew and cared about her
he beat the shit out of her
but he felt remorse
he covered her up afterward
because he felt conflicted
not like this man
these are the work of someone
who is not conflicted at all
hes doing exactly what he wants to do
highly organized
ill bet there were no prints
no stains no blood
right
no sign of forced entry
he probably conned his way in
they may or may not be about sex
but theyre about power
see the multiple thumbprints
along the throat
was the hyoid bone broken
yes it was
he strangles them face to face
so they can see his power
and he can watch their terror
that gets him off
then he revives them and does it again
look for an intelligent white male
20 to 30 years old socially functional
with a major interest in golden oldies
did i pass
you passed
what do you mean by golden oldies
wheres the stocking
that was tied around this ones neck
howd you know that
i mean i assume it was a stocking
and not pantyhose
tied in a big loopy bow
like this one
right
for goodness sakes
its the boston strangler
hes imitating albert desalvos
crime scene down to the kinky details
this guys copycatting a serial killer
whos been dead for
twenty years
why desalvo why not somebody
in the news recently
gacy or ramirez
i dont know
these guys are like viruses
theres always some new mutation
the commissioner is up my ass
saying we could use help here
we could use help
we need their vlcap we need their
database thingies
the fbi will bury you with fucking help
during patty hearst
some kid with a crew cut
took over my office for a month
so youre saying
im saying if you need help
nikko is almost through
with the chinatown thing
that really wont be necessary sir
join us we need you
anyone with a similar profile
to the strangler
or with a german wife can you do that
anyone who wears green pants
the files in from boston yet
should be here tomorrow
what are you up to
going to chinatown
sit in on this for a minute
what do you got
winning
im pulverizing him
all right im off
see you
have a good time
i wont wait up
got you
shes next
how do you know
cause i watched her face change to that
did you try to play it back
how did he send this to you
he hacked into her lnternet address
can we trace it
only if hes online right now
he aint
can we rewind or
yeah we should be able to play it back
how long is the program
thirty seconds
can we get a copy of that face
no its too big a file
back up to tape
shes got a tape backup
we can make a copy and take it with us
how do you know all this
misspent youth in video arcades i guess
a lot of quarters
why would he send this to you
why do you think
no one mentioned your involvement
there is no involvement im not involved
this is a game they play
they hang around watching the cops
feeling superior to them
lnstead of catching him you led him to me
he didnt write to me
he wrote to you why
because im their damn pinup girl
they all know me they have libraries
they collect clippings
im the muse of serial killers
try the c drive
any other suggestions
its gone the file is not here
its not on c drive and its not in list
you think he put a virus in there
yeah
what exactly is
he wrote a virus into the program
if you try to copy it its erased
he boobytrapped it
i must hand it to the guy
hes a smart motherfucker
do you remember what she looked like
yes
she looked like a girl
she looked like a million other girls
i barely saw her
im going to the office to get
a systems guy on this maybe marty
whatre you doing
unplugging this
its an open window
he can crawl in any time he likes
he comes in we grab him
