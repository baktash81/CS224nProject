makes him feel intensely alive 
what he feels next is not guilt   
   but disappointment 
it was not as wonderful as he d hoped 
maybe next time  it will be perfect 
and as his determination builds
to take another life   
   he plans  in obsessive detail   
   what props he ll bring   
   what knots he ll tie 
let me ask you something 
what turns you on 
what really does it for you 
is it a great body 
is it a nice smile  is it beautiful legs 
what turns on a serial killer is the suffering
and death of a human being 
now  i d like to ask you guys a favor 
if you could all stand up 
all the men in the room 
please indulge me 
come on  it s only fair 
after all the time you ve ogled us 
now  would everybody under 20
and over 35 have a seat 
if you are of asian or african american
descent  you may sit down 
kenny  turn that light on  please   
   so we can get a good look at these guys 
ladies  what do you see 
some pretty cute guys  don t you think 
if one of these fellas asked you out
for a drink  you d go 
let me tell you something 
nine out of ten serial killers
are white males   
   aged 20 to 35   
   just like these 
albert desalvo  bianchi and buono   
   berkowitz  dahmer  ted bundy 
they were quiet  unassuming   
   even nice 
they had jobs 
they made decent neighbors 
their victims trusted them 
the fbl estimates   
   there could be as many
as 35 serial killers   
   cruising for victims even as i speak 
guys  sit down  you re scaring me 
serial killers   
   are not a 20th century invention   
   but we are spawning them
in greater numbers 
the state of florida
spent almost  8 million   
   to electrocute ted 
you re dead 
sorry 
the state of florida spent  8 million
to electrocute ted bundy 
wouldn t that money have been
better spent keeping him in jail   
   subject to intense scientific scrutiny 
isn t our best hope to try to identify
the ted bundys of the future   
   before they kill 
thank you

i m an intuitive cop 
with poor impulse control 
let s assume you didn t mow down
a 75 year old man   
   who couldn t hear your warning
because he s deaf 
let s say you greased the guy
while he was trying to surrender 
now  you re on leave pending an inquiry 
friends wonder if you re a psychopath 
on top of that

a wrongful death action up your tail 
all right  smart ass  let s see how you do

celebrating 25 years of the spirit
of the 60s in san francisco

in golden gate park 
why did you remove evidence from the 
i want to hear this 
in potrero hill   
   homicide detectives discovered
yet another grisly murder today 
police would not comment  but informed
sources inside the department   
   tell us this latest death   
   could be the work of the same killer
responsible for the deaths of two women 
susan schiffer  potrero hill 
you messed with the scene 
someone around here can t keep
his yap shut  and i ll find out who 
what did you do with the stocking 
i tagged it 
i don t want some blabbermouth
leaking the mo to her   
   so she can tell everyone 
leaving us nothing to play 
am i in charge of this or not 
why are you so prickly 
i ought to be the one deciding
what evidence to sequester

would you like to sequester 
 the stocking around the neck 
 the stocking around the neck

eighty seven 
harvey   
get the fuck out of here

lnnocent blood is on these hands 
i understand  that s a terrible thing 
but let me tell you   
   if you come back 
i ll make you stand in the corner again 
 but innocent blood is on these hands 
 i understand  it s terrible 
you don t care about the truth 
we pay for city government  just like this 
and you never care about the truth 
i killed her 
 i know 
 i killed her in the bathtub 
good bye  harvey 
was it something i did in another life 
probably something you did in this one 
stuff came in from mercer 
medical  dental receipts   
nothing in common with the others 
what s that around your neck 
i d get one like yours 
but i don t live near k mart 
how about friends  acquaintances 
the only thing these girls had in common
is they all owned vibrators 
the tool of survival 
how can he come to work wearing that 
lay off him 
a cop should look like a cop 
what s the world coming to 
let me let you talk to the lead inspector
on the case 
hold on 
mj  we got deep throat again 
how many calls is that 
that makes three today  fourteen  total 
phone company set up on our centrex 
yes  this morning 
 have gigi put a tracer on her ass 
 i ll see if it ll work 
lnspector monahan speaking  homicide 
ask her about the moon bike 
i m interested in your ideas 
the moon bike   
what is that 
moon bike 
i said a  lunar cycle  
i think he might be on a lunar cycle 
because the first two murders
were 28 days apart 
still want to crackjokes 
no  this is no joke  neither is tying up
police lines with crank calls 
are you calling me a crank 
do you have any evidence to report 
did you know the victims 
this is number 3 
that is an opinion  not evidence 
may i ask who i m speaking with 
who s helen hudson 
what did you think of his claim 
that he tied these women to a tree   
   and burned them alive
because joan of arc told him to 
he was lying 
how do you know 
people suffering from aural hallucinations
hear voices in both ears 
in stereo 
daryll lee told me   
   joan of arc always appeared
on his left side   
   and spoke softly in his left ear 
those are the lab results 
hot off the press  no sperm 
we ve got a serial 
you didn t say that 
you interviewed cullum three times 
who s that 
the woman that got the cop killed 
she might be useful 
that woman is a wrong number 
work the clues  for christ s sake 
what clues  we don t have any clues 
nobody here has ever worked
a serial case before 
i have 
the zodiac  right 
did anyone ever catch the zodiac 
or did he die of old age 
commissioner s on 2 
about the chinatown thing 
work the clues 
but what else 
mr  cullum satisfies the rules for sanity   
   in being fully aware
at the time of the murders   
   that his actions were wrong
and unlawful 
thank you  dr  hudson 
no more questions 
san francisco homicide 
i m lnspector goetz 
this is lnspector monahan 
is helen hudson here 
i m her assistant  can i help 
could we have a few minutes 
come in 
this way  please 
dr  hudson  these are lnspectors goetz
and monahan 
he s escaped again  right 
i m sorry 
well 
is he out or isn t he

phone calls 
i didn t make any phone calls 
isn t this nice 
would everyone like to sit down 
shall i make coffee 
get me my stuff 
joyfully 
i talked to you this morning  dr  hudson 
do you remember 
of course i remember 
there s nothing wrong with my memory 
you called me a crank 
i suppose i am 
i got a couple crank calls myself 
that s why i thought
daryll lee cullum was out of prison 
if daryll lee had gotten out 
you d be the first to know 
good 
i m relieved 
i hate to sound like a broken record 
but you called us 
i did  i m sorry  it won t happen again 
why 
there s a serial killer out there who s
strangled three women  he ll do it again 
if there s evidence connecting these
murders  nothing s been made public 
how do you connect them 
i don t know 
twenty years of clinical experience
with serial killers 
would you work with us on this 
you re kidding 
i thought you knew
that i don t do this anymore 
i m retired 
is that why you called us 14 times 
 cause you re retired 
help me out  i really admire your work 
does she do this   
   wide eyed little girl routine often 
yeah 
does it work 
 usually 
 sometimes 
you can spare me the bullshit 
you don t admire me or like me 
none of your people do 
but i don t give a fuck 
that s the upside of a nervous breakdown 
if you don t mind  i have a very busy day 
it s a hell of an apartment you got here 
i guess   
   the books you wrote
about these scumbags paid well 
we can t afford to pay you   
   your usual fee   
   but if you d be so kind as to look   
i don t want these here 
 would you be comfortable downtown 
 i don t want to see them here 
i ll drive you  if you prefer 
it s all right  it s okay 
just breathe  i m here 
 should we call the paramedics 
 no 
it s just a good  old fashioned panic attack 
she hyperventilates till she faints  then her
breathing gets normal and she s fine 
 what did we do 
 she s agoraphobic 
she s afraid of spiders  too 
she hasn t left home in over a year 
she s okay 
she s fine  ln half an hour 
she ll be singing 
tell her   
   we re sorry we bothered her 
did you want her to look at those 
if you do  leave them 
i ll make sure they re safe 
tell her to call me   
   if she feels like it 
that one is a strange ranger 
quinn said she was a crackpot 
he forgot to mention pill popping
juicehead   
   hyperventilating  agoraphobic asshole 
i thought she was sweet 
honest to god 
are they gone 
all gone 
i must ve looked like such an asshole 
you look good with a bag on your head 
oh  god 
i want to die 
i wouldn t 
he ll be back 
who ll be back 
don t be coy 
you thought he was cute  too 
no  i didn t  i did not 
you like those cute  brutal types
with the eyebrows and the handcuffs 
admit it 
oh  god 
what  what d i say 
nothing 
i miss men 
what am l 
you know what i mean 
i miss sex 
he was pretty cute 
yes  he was very cute 
no young cops for you 
up you come  sit over here 
look at these pictures 
why are these here 
i ll get you some coffee 
i can t 
why don t you just die  then 
they ll find you years from now amongst
unopened mail and unread newspapers 
yeah  the old hermit lady 
she lived on cat food and camembert 
she used to be a really good shrink 
make up your mind  here s your coffee 
live or die 
you scared me 
burning the midnight oil 
this stuff never gets any easier 
that s why they pay us the small bucks 
do you   
what would you think if   
   when you re finished here
we go to joe s and we   
   have a steak and   
i don t think so 
thanks anyway 
you got other plans 
not that it s any of my business

bean curd  smoked eel sushi

no  i can kiss you  if you like 
go fuck yourself 
who put the bug up his ass 
where s my cheeseburger 
i made an executive decision 
japanese 
it s better for your heart 
you didn t even get french fries 
you re pissing me off 
here  here 
any word from   
   helen  paper bag  hudson 
not yet  but there will be 
no way 
five bucks she s going to call tonight 
deal 
wait a minute 
what s this quarter pounder
with cheese doing here 
lnspector monahan  please 
these three are the work of the same man 
this one is different 
are you testing me 
not exactly  we had reason to believe   
i have to take tests now 
ongoing case 
six months 
the scene is disorganized 
the killer lives nearby 
he would ve been too disoriented to drive 
you have two possibilities  one is
a mental patient  the other is a boyfriend 
someone who was denied sex
on this occasion   
   who knew and cared about her 
he beat the shit out of her 
but he felt remorse 
he covered her up afterward 
because he felt conflicted 
not like this man 
these are the work of someone
who is not conflicted at all 
he s doing exactly what he wants to do 
highly organized 
i ll bet there were no prints 
no stains  no blood 
right 
no sign of forced entry 
he probably conned his way in 
they may or may not be about sex   
   but they re about power 
see the multiple thumbprints
along the throat 
was the hyoid bone broken 
yes  it was 
he strangles them face to face 
so they can see his power   
   and he can watch their terror 
that gets him off 
then he revives them and does it again 
look for an intelligent white male 
20 to 30 years old  socially functional   
   with a major interest in golden oldies 
did i pass 
you passed 
what do you mean by golden oldies 
where s the stocking
that was tied around this one s neck 
how d you know that 
i mean  i assume it was a stocking
and not pantyhose   
   tied in a big loopy bow   
   like this one 
right 
for goodness sakes 
it s the boston strangler 
he s imitating albert desalvo s
crime scene down to the kinky details 
this guy s copycatting a serial killer
who s been dead for   
twenty years 
why desalvo  why not somebody
in the news recently 
gacy or ramirez 
i don t know 
these guys are like viruses 
there s always some new mutation 
the commissioner is up my ass 
saying we could use help here 
we could use help 
we need their vlcap  we need their   
   database thingies 
the fbi will bury you with fucking help 
during patty hearst   
   some kid with a crew cut
took over my office for a month 
so  you re saying    
i m saying  if you need help   
   nikko is almost through
with the chinatown thing 
that really won t be necessary  sir 
join us  we need you 
anyone with a similar profile
to the strangler 
or with a german wife  can you do that 
anyone who wears green pants   
the files in from boston  yet 
should be here tomorrow 
what are you up to 
going to chinatown 
sit in on this for a minute 
what do you got 
winning 
i m pulverizing him 
all right  i m off 
 see you 
 have a good time 
i won t wait up 
got you 
she s next 
how do you know 
 cause i watched her face change to that 
did you try to play it back 
how did he send this to you 
he hacked into her lnternet address 
can we trace it 
 only if he s online right now 
 he ain t 
can we rewind or    
yeah  we should be able to play it back 
 how long is the program 
 thirty seconds 
 can we get a copy of that face 
 no  it s too big a file 
back up to tape 
she s got a tape backup 
we can make a copy and take it with us 
how do you know all this 
misspent youth in video arcades  i guess 
a lot of quarters 
why would he send this to you 
why do you think 
no one mentioned your involvement 
there is no involvement  i m not involved 
this is a game they play 
they hang around watching the cops   
   feeling superior to them 
lnstead of catching him  you led him to me 
he didn t write to me 
he wrote to you  why 
because i m their damn pinup girl 
they all know me  they have libraries 
they collect clippings 
i m the muse of serial killers 
try the c drive 
any other suggestions 
it s gone  the file is not here 
it s not on c drive  and it s not in list 
you think he put a virus in there 
 yeah 
 what exactly is    
he wrote a virus into the program 
if you try to copy it  it s erased 
he booby trapped it 
i must hand it to the guy 
 he s a smart motherfucker 
 do you remember what she looked like 
yes 
she looked like a girl 
she looked like a million other girls 
i barely saw her 
i m going to the office to get
a systems guy on this  maybe marty 
what re you doing 
unplugging this 
it s an open window 
he can crawl in any time he likes 
he comes in  we grab him 
it s the only lead we ve got 
and what am l 
the lamb tied to the stake 
this is the only space
that i have in the world 
 you re not getting it 
 i ll get a guard here 
i don t want a guard here 
all right 
 we re all working together 
 i m not 
i m not working with anybody 
turn the monitor back on and i ll stay
until we figure out what s happening 
 go on 
 catch you later 
all right 
heil  hitler

they claim they didn t see anything 
you received a call from dispatch
at 6 35 a m  
correct  6 35  the first unit arrived
about 15 minutes later 
great 
did you isolate the kids who found her 
yes  they re over on the side of the hill 
how many of you knew her 
we just danced with her 
really 
you just met her tonight 
excuse me 
good afternoon 
did you stand too far
from your razor today 
i was up all night with a sick friend 
i want to talk to you 
have you got a thing going with mj now 
i don t believe you 
good god  man  you stink 
heavy date last night

don t go screwing around on her 
she doesn t deserve that 
remind me again why she dumped you 
why is he here 
what do you see  tell me what you see 
there are stains 
so  she s been sexually assaulted 
no defense wounds  no ligature marks
or bruising  like the others 
very cyanotic 
asphyxiation  huh 
 doesn t look like our guy 
 you don t think so 
look at her heels 
there s abrasions  but no bleeding 
 she s been dragged up here postmortem 
 maybe 
on this stuff we re not going to get
any prints or tracks 
long night 
 don t you start 
 what about her arms 
there s needle marks 
no tracks  not a regular user 
probably so stoned 
she never knew what got her 
hope so 
a lot of little hippie girls 
they all want to make love 
they all want to be beautiful
