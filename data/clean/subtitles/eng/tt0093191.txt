world seems sinking dust recount
beginning
singsong voice sustains
saved tale present troubles
protected future
finished sweeping centuries past
think day day

drying onions equal tree trunk crossing marsh
one far succeeded singing epic peace
wrong peace inspiration doesnt endure
story hardly told
must give
give mankind lose storyteller
mankind loses storyteller
also lose childhood

still borders ever
street border line
plot theres mans land strip
hidden hedge ditch
dares fall booby traps
hit laser beams
trout water really torpedoes
every proprietor even tenant
sticks nameplate like coat arms
studies paper like world leader
german people divided many states individuals
small states mobile
one takes
demands toll another wants enter
form fly amber leather bottle
much border
one enter state right passwords
todays german soul conquered governed

fortunately one able
everyone migrates raises flag world

child child choked spinach peas
rice pudding steamed cauliflower
eats
child child woke strange bed
time time
many people seemed beautiful nowadays odd one
precise picture paradise guess
couldnt imagine nothingness today shudders idea
child child played enthusiasm
muster concerns work
recall first visit
history yet begun
let mornings evenings go waited
took long time river find bed stagnant water flow
valley primeval river one day still remember
glacier melted icebergs drifted north
tree passed still green empty birds nest
fish leapt myriad years
came moment bees drowned
time later two stags fought bank
flies antlers like branches flowing river
ever grew grass
growing bodies wild cats wild boar buffaloes
one morning savannah forehead smeared grass
appeared biped image long awaited
first word shout
ah oh merely groan
last able laugh first time
mans shout followers learnt speak
long story
sun lightning thunder sky
earth firesides leaps
round dances signs writing
one broke cycle ran straight ahead
long ran straight ahead swerving sometimes perhaps joy
seemed free could laugh
suddenly ran zigzag stones flew
flight began history wars still going
story grass sun leaps shouts
still going
know one day road built
next day saw napoleon retreat
paved later
today covered grass sunk like roman road
tank tracks
werent even spectators weve always
really want conquer history
timeless downward look taught
want transmute sustain glance
short shout sour smell
ive outside long enough absent long enough
long enough world let enter history world
hold apple hand
look feathers water already vanished
look tyre marks asphalt cigarette butt rolling
primeval river dried todays raindrops still quiver
world behind world
roman roads still lead somewhere
oldest traces lead anywhere
top pass
even plains even berlin hidden passes
country country tale begins
doesnt everyone see childhood
passes doors crevices
ground sky
everyone saw would history without murder war
time im funny im calm
red socks black shoes stupid
foggy cold put pullover afraid cold
good jacket bargain pockets torn
gave
pebbles roof doesnt fly away nonsense
id like fly
plane circles berlin one day itll crash
cold hands always warm good sign
crackles underfoot time
suns setting logical west know west
always took ubahn east go home
bought tickets saved mark
sun back left star
thats good sun star little feet
hopping one foot danced sweetly
alone
got letter dont want read
berlin means nothing havel lake
wedding east everywhere really
strange people theyre shouting dont care
thoughts id really rather think
