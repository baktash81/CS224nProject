the river a torrent
and this puddle to be the sea
when the child was a child
it didnt know it was a child
everything was full of life
and all life was one
when the child was a child
it had no opinion about anything
it had no habits
it often sat crosslegged
took off running
had a cowlick in its hair
and didnt pull a face
when photographed
look
the consolation of lifting ones head
out here in the open
of seeing the colours
enlightened by the sun
in all mens eyes
at last mad no longer alone
at last mad at last redeemed
at last mad at last at peace
at last an internal light
were approaching berlin tegel the
nosmoking sign has been turned on
please stop smoking
until youre inside the airport
theres a little house
with two floors and a terrace
and every day we go bathing
the man who lives there
is called peter
pretty picture
nothing good to see on tv
you stumble over your colours
and are never punctual
still the same smell but dustier
she collected everything
stamps postcards
even ubahn tickets
she never threw anything away
mother my mother
she never was
my father
my father was my father
she is dead
no tears no grief maybe later
dependant on everybody
my sister i have to get out of here
shes never loved me
and you also just pretend
be glad that they forgot about you
want to die immediately
dont want to go on living
my god what will become of the boy
hes only got music on his mind
what does he want now
i already bought him a guitar
does he wants drums now
im slowly getting fed up with it
wont he ever grow up
no really im getting fed up
i dont want to go on with this
no really this has to stop some time
i cant help him any more
no wonder he only learnt rock n roll
maybe hell get a grip on himself
one day
when the child was a child
it was the time of these questions
why am i me and why not you
why am i here and why not there
when did time begin
and where does space end
isnt life under the sun
just a dream
isnt what i see hear and smell just a
mirage of the world before the world
does evil actually exist
and people who are really evil
how can it be that i the one i am
wasnt there before i was there
and that some time i the one i am
no longer will be the one i am
the child needs oxygen
breathe deep down
if i could only suffer in her place
it hurts
itll be over soon
its almost over
poor little mite im anxious to see you
i wonder what you look like
you bastard you bastard
women will fuck up your life
blackie i think i got lost
we wanted to go to the cemetery
well
sunrise at 722 am sunset at 428 pm
moonrise at 704 pm moonset
level of the havel and the spree
20 years ago today a soviet jet fighter
crashed into the lakes at spandau
50 years ago there were
the olympic games
200 years ago
the first balloon flew over the city
like the fugitives the other day
and today
lilienthaler chaussee
a man slows down
and looks over his shoulder
into space
someone who wants
to put an end to it
put firstissue stamps
on his farewell letters
a different one on each
then he spoke english
with an american soldier
for the first time since his schooldays
fluently
just before dashing his head against
the wall a prisoner said now
instead of the stations name
the guard
suddenly shouted tierra del fuego
nice
an old man was reading
the odyssey to a child
and the young listener
stopped blinking his eyes
and what do you have to tell
a passerby who in the rain
folded her umbrella and was drenched
a schoolboy who described
to his teacher a fern growing
and the astounded teacher
a blind woman who groped her watch
feeling my presence
its great to live by the spirit
to testify for eternity
only what is spiritual
in peoples minds
but sometimes im fed up
with my spiritual existence
of forever hovering above
id like to feel a weight in me
to end the infinity
and to tie me to earth
id like at each step
each gust of wind
to be able to say
now now and now
no longer
forever and for eternity
sit at the empty place at a card table
be greeted
even by a nod
every time we participated
it was a pretence
wrestling allowing a hip to be put out
in pretence
catching a fish in pretence
in pretence sitting at tables
drinking and eating in pretence
having lambs roasted and wine served
in the tents in the desert
only in pretence
i dont have to beget a child
or plant a tree
but it would be nice
coming home after a long day
to feed the cat like philip marlowe
to have a fever
blackened fingers from the newspaper
to be excited not only by the mind
but by a meal
by the line of a neck
by an ear
to lie
through ones teeth
as youre walking
to feel your bones moving along
at last to guess
instead of always knowing
to be able to say
ah and oh and hey
instead of yes and amen
yes
to be able to enthuse for evil
to draw all the demons
from the passersby
and to chase them out into the world
to be a savage
or to feel how it is to take off
your shoes under the table
and to wriggle your toes barefoot
like that
stay alone
let things happen keep serious
we can only be savages
in as much as we keep serious
do no more than look
assemble testify preserve
remain spirit
keep your distance keep your word
look a convertible
you dont buy that you steal it
or its stolen from you
imagine
open the roof leave the smog behind
in a pimpmobile
tell me muse the storyteller
he who has been thrust
to the edge of the world
both an infant and an ancient
and through him reveal everyman
with time those who listened to me
became my readers
they no longer sit in a circle
but apart
and one doesnt know anything
about the other
im an old man
with a broken voice
but the story
still rises from the depths
and the slowly opened mouth
repeats it as clearly
as it does powerfully
a liturgy for which no one
needs to be initiated
to the meaning
of the words and sentences
maybe she doesnt have the money
to see another doctor
4 years since i saw her
shes been sick for 2
when will you pray with your
own words and not for eternal life
and then these young girls
make eyes at men
so why am i living why am i living
how will i pay
with my small pension
youre lost
it can go on for a long time
abandoned by parents
betrayed by wife
friend in another town
your children only recall your stutter
you could hit yourself
as you look in the mirror
whats that
whats going on
im still there
if i want it if i only want it
i must want it
then i can get out of it again
i let myself go
i can drag myself out again
of course mother was right
hey two marks
no its a beer top
nonsense lets pull it up
only 10 pfennigs
you bet was great last night
it wasnt on last night
a few days ago or a month
im all alone
just mad on my own
three at play
thatll be the day
5 years ago
and they lived happily ever after
marion not like that mon dieu
what is this
with a swing not with force
what are you doing
dont dangle fly
you are an angel
for heavens sake
and for my sake too
i cant fly with these things
yes you can
its easier with wings than without
not with these chicken feathers
what did she say
these wings bother her
marion just imagine youre a dove
you bunch of sparrows
what are you playing at
sounds like a firemens ball
thats enough
concentrate marion
she works hard
with those chicken feathers
marion make an effort
make an effort
of course i make an effort
what do you think im doing
id have fallen on your heads long ago
if i didnt make an effort
one moment please
hold everything we cant pay the rent
and the electricity
were broke
so tomorrow well take things down
pull the caravans to winter quarters
the bailiffs been
this is it for the circus this year
im sorry
its over not even a season
once again
no time to bring something to an end
tonight the last night
of my good old number
and its a full moon
and the trapeze artist
comes tumbling down
taistoi be quiet
i never imagined it like that
the farewell to the circus
the last evening no one shows up
you play like fools
and i fly around the ring
like a poor chicken
and then im a waitress again
merde
moments like that
like right now
a beautiful memory
in 10 years time
time will heal everything
but what if time was the illness
as if sometimes one had to lean over
to go on living
to live a look is enough
the circus ill miss it
its funny
its the end and i dont feel a thing
an angel passes by
i must stop
having a bad conscience
as if pain had no past
it always stops
when its only just starting
to be too good to be true
at last outside in the city
find out who i am
who i have become
most of the time
im too aware to be sad
i waited an eternity
to hear a loving word
then i went abroad
someone whod say
i love you so much today
that would be wonderful
i look up and the world
appears before my eyes
and fills my heart
as a child
i wanted to live on an island
a woman alone gloriously alone
yes thats it
everything so empty incompatible
emptiness fear
la peur la peur la peur
fear
like a small animal
lost in the woods
who are you
i dont know any more
but i do know
i will no longer be a trapeze artist
must not cry thats how it is
it happens
not always as youd like it
emptiness such emptiness
what shall i do
not think any more
just be there
berlin here im a stranger
and yet its all so familiar
you cant get lost
you always end up at the wall
im waiting for my photo at a machine
and it comes out with another face
that could be the beginning of a story
the faces id like to see faces
maybe ill find a job as a waitress
this evening scares me
its silly fear makes me sick
only part of me worries
the other part doesnt believe in it
how should i live
maybe thats not the question
how should i think
i know so little maybe
because im always just curious
sometimes i think so wrongly
because im thinking
as if i was talking to someone else
inside closed eyes
close the eyes again
then even the stones come alive
to be with the colours
les couleurs the colours
neon lights in the evening sky
the red and yellow sbahn
longing longing
i only need to be ready
longing for a wave of love
that would stir in me
thats what makes me clumsy
the absence of desire
desire to love
desire to love
dont stare
have you never seen anyone die
i stink of gasoline
i cant just it was all so clear
the way theyre standing there
staring at me
i should have told her yesterday
that im sorry
i cant simply
ive still got so much to do
as i came up the mountain
out of the misty valley into the sun
the fire on the cattle range
the potatoes in the ashes
the boathouse floating on the lake
the southern cross the far east
the great north the wild west
the great bear lake
the tristan de cunha island
the mississippi delta stromboli
the old houses of charlottenburg
albert camus
the morning light
the eyes of the child
swimming near the waterfall
the spots of the first drops of rain
the sun
the bread and wine hopping
easter the veins of the leaves
the blowing grass
the colours of the stones
the pebbles on the streams bed
the white tablecloth outdoors
the dream of the house in the house
the dear one asleep
in the next room
the peaceful sunday
the horizon
the light from the room
in the garden
the night flight
riding a bicycle with no hands
the beautiful stranger
my father
my mother
my wife
my child
the world seems to be sinking
into dust but i recount
as in the beginning
in my singsong voice
which sustains me
saved by the tale
from present troubles
and protected for the future
finished with the sweeping
over the centuries as in the past
now i can think only day by day
my heroes are no longer
the warriors and kings
but the things of peace
one equal to the other
the drying onions equal
to the tree trunk crossing the marsh
but no one has so far succeeded
in singing an epic of peace
what is wrong with peace
that its inspiration doesnt endure
and that its story is hardly told
must i give up now
if i do give up
then mankind will lose its storyteller
and once mankind
loses its storyteller
it will also lose its childhood
i cannot find the potsdamer platz
here this cant be it
potsdamer platz
thats where cafe josti used to be
in the afternoons i went there
to chat and to drink a coffee
and to watch the crowd
before that i smoked my cigar
at loese and wolf
a renowned tobacconist
just across from here
this cant be the potsdamer platz
and no one whom you can ask
it was a lively place
tramways horsedrawn carriages
and two cars
mine and that of the chocolate shop
the wertheim store was here too
and then suddenly
the flags appeared
here
the whole platz
was covered with them
and the people
werent friendly anymore
and the police wasnt either
i will not give up
as long as i havent found
the potsdamer platz
where are my heroes
where are you my children
where are my own the dullwitted
the original ones
name me muse
the immortal singer
who
abandoned by his mortal audience
iost his voice
he who
from angel of poetry that he was
became the organ grinder
ignored or mocked
outside
on the threshold of no mans land
20 marks 40 marks 80 marks
in a week i could have 500
off to the south
what a crazy idea to stand here
too much traffic
idiot
three times hes been this way
i want to get out of here
if anyone recognises me ill be
thrown out of secondary school
i need klaus
hed take good care of me
he was so good too good
and now hes dead
are there still borders
more than ever
each street has its own border line
between each plot
theres a no mans land strip
hidden by a hedge or by a ditch
who dares
will fall on booby traps
or be hit by laser beams
the trout in the water
are really torpedoes
every proprietor or even tenant
sticks up his nameplate
like a coat of arms
and studies the paper
like a world leader
the german people are divided into as
many states as there are individuals
and these small states are mobile
each one takes his own with him
and demands a toll
when another wants to enter
in the form of a fly in amber
or a leather bottle
so much for the border
but one can only enter each state
with the right passwords
todays german soul can only
be conquered and governed
by he who arrives at each small state
with the password
fortunately
no one is now able to do so
so everyone migrates and
raises his own flag all over the world
even their children
shake their rattles
and trail their filth around
in circles
the medals reflect the best
they were elegant
those brothers
could i have light
but no flame
youre welcome
thank you
the only thing i shall miss
from the outside
from the realm of light
will be sparrows
money buys happiness
how to live
the man in the golden helmet
is a swindle
youre not natives
youre all refugees
youre wet from swimming
ive been sitting here
since this morning
im so cold and bored
wind in the face
the first snow in the air
water in the gutter
the balcony
with the beautiful stranger
real ones they look like it
they could be real ones
some stole food from the dogs
in the camps
that would take the grin off your face
dont be too sure yet
the frenchman
i met him in the streets
berlin wont be there any more
constant said
the house was half gone
some of it still stood for how long
yes i can still see this woman
who was standing up there
in the ruins shaking the duvet
when was that
may june 1945
is he good at what hes doing
it seems so
id like to see it
maybe hell give it to me
come ill show you something else
when the child was a child
it choked on spinach peas
rice pudding
and steamed cauliflower
and now eats all of that
and not just because it has to
when the child was a child
it woke up once in a strange bed
but now time and time again
many people seemed beautiful then
nowadays its only the odd one
it had a precise picture of paradise
and now can only guess at it
it couldnt imagine nothingness
and today shudders at the idea
when the child was a child
it played with enthusiasm
and now it can only muster it
when it concerns its work
do you recall our first visit here
history had not yet begun
we let mornings and evenings go by
and waited
it took a long time for the river to find
its bed and the stagnant water to flow
valley of the primeval river
one day i still remember
the glacier melted
and the icebergs drifted to the north
a tree passed by still green
with an empty birds nest
only the fish had leapt
over a myriad of years
then came the moment
when the bees drowned
some time later
the two stags fought on the bank
then the flies and the antlers
like branches flowing down the river
all that ever grew again was grass
growing over the bodies of wild cats
wild boar and buffaloes
one morning out of the savannah
its forehead smeared with grass
appeared the biped
our image so long awaited
and its first word was a shout
was it ah or oh
or was it merely a groan
we were at last able to laugh
for the first time
through this mans shout and that
of his followers we learnt to speak
a long story
sun lightning thunder in the sky
and below on earth
the firesides the leaps
the round dances
the signs the writing
then one broke through the cycle
and ran straight ahead
as long as he ran straight ahead
swerving sometimes perhaps from joy
he seemed free
and again we could laugh with him
but then suddenly he ran zigzag
and stones flew
with his flight began
the history of wars it is still going on
but the story of the grass the sun
the leaps and the shouts
is still going on too
do you know how one day
the road was built here
which the next day
saw the napoleon retreat
and was paved later on
today it is covered with grass
and sunk in like a roman road
with the tank tracks
but we werent even spectators
weve always been too few
you really want
to conquer a history for myself
what my timeless downward look
has taught me
i want to transmute
to sustain a glance
a short shout a sour smell
ive been outside long enough
absent long enough
long enough out of the world
let me enter the history of the world
or just hold an apple in my hand
look those feathers
there on the water already vanished
look the tyre marks on the asphalt
and now the cigarette butt rolling
the primeval river has dried up
and only todays raindrops still quiver
down with the world behind the world
only the roman roads
still lead somewhere
only the oldest traces
lead anywhere
where is the top of the pass here
even the plains even berlin
has its hidden passes
and its only there that my country
the country of the tale begins
why doesnt everyone see
from childhood on
the passes doors and crevices
on the ground
and above in the sky
if everyone saw them there would be
history without murder or war
this time im doing it
funny im so calm
why red socks with black shoes
stupid
foggy cold
put on a pullover afraid to be cold
very good jacket a bargain
just the pockets torn
she gave it to me
pebbles on the roof why
so it doesnt fly away nonsense
once id like to fly
the plane circles over berlin
one day itll crash
its cold my hands were
always warm a good sign
it crackles underfoot
what time is it
the suns setting logical the west
now i know where the west is
i always took the ubahn to the east
to go home
bought 10 tickets saved a mark
the sun in my back
on the left the star
thats good sun and a star
her little feet
hopping from one foot to the other
she danced so sweetly
we were all alone
has she got my letter
i dont want her to read it
berlin means nothing to me
havel is that a lake
over there wedding or what
the east is everywhere really
strange people theyre shouting
i dont care
all these thoughts
id really rather not think any more
im going why
leave me alone you swine
mother mother
ill never make it tonight
no trapeze on fullmoon nights
not the last time the very last time
i should wake up from this dream
the end of the circus fini
and once again i feel
as if night were falling inside of me
fear fear of death
why not death
the essential at times
just being beautiful and nothing more
to look at oneself in the mirror
is to see oneself think
so what do you think
i think i still have the right to be afraid
but not to talk about it
youre not yet blind
the heart is still beating
and now youre crying after all
youd like to cry
like a very sad little girl
do you know why youre crying
for whom
not for me
i dont know for whom
id like to know i know nothing
im a little bit afraid
its gone gone away itll come back
it doesnt matter
just to be able to say
like right now im happy
i have a story
and ill go on having one
there it is again
this feeling of wellbeing
as if inside my body
a hand was softly tightening
when the child was a child
it was the time of these questions
why am i me and why not you
why am i here and why not there
when did time begin
and where does space end
isnt life under the sun just a dream
isnt that columbo
dont think so
not with that motheaten coat
he wouldnt be out here
well
im going to enter the river
an old human expression
that i only understand today
now or never moment of the ford
but there is no other bank
there is only the river
into the ford of time
the ford of death
were not yet born
so lets descend
to look is not to look from on high
but at eyelevel
first ill take a bath
then ill be shaved
by a turkish barber
who will also massage me
down to the fingertips
then ill buy a newspaper and read it
from the headlines to the horoscope
on the first day ill only be served
for requests ask the neighbour
if someone stumbles over my legs
hell apologise
if pushed ill push back
the bartender will find me
an empty table
a car will stop
and the mayor will give me a lift
ill be familiar to everyone
suspect to no one
i wont say a word
will understand every language
this will be my first day
but none of it will be true
ill take her in my arms
and shell take me in her arms
i think hes drunk
yes
lets go
its got a taste
now i begin to understand
is that red
yes
did you hurt yourself
is today a good day
its okay
and the pipes
theyre yellow
yellow what about him
hes greyblue
greyblue this one
purple
this one
orange ochre
ochre or orange
ochre
yellow red this one
its green
and whats that over the eye
thats blue
blue
is it very cold
itll soon be over
id love to have a coffee
do you have money
yes no
im glad everything is fine today
beautiful
coffee
with milk and sugar
black
when the child was a child it lived
on apples and bread that was enough
and it is still that way
when the child was a child berries fell
only like berries into its hand
and they still do now
fresh walnuts made its tongue raw
and they still do now
atop each mountain
it was longing for a higher mountain
and in each city
it was longing for a bigger city
and it still does
reached in the treetop
for the cherries
as excitedly as it still does today
was shy in front of strangers
and it still is
waited for the first snow
and still waits that way
when the child was a child it threw
a stick like a lance into a tree
and its still quivering there today
how do i get to akazienstrasse
go up potsdamer to kleistpark
right at grunewald past gleditsch
no right turn at goltzstrasse
turn left and there you are
this entrance is for the crew
extras the other way please
extra
thats just what you look like
they all want autographs
lousy cop
come on marion dont worry
itll be alright
ill send you a postcard
of the eiffel tower
see you next season
dont forget the alekan circus
bye archie see you next year
au revoir
a thousand kisses
ill send you a parcel
with some camembert cheese
i couldnt say who i am
i dont have the slightest idea
i am someone
with no roots no story no country
and i like it that way
i am here i am free i can imagine
anything its all possible
i only have to raise my eyes
and once again i become the world
now in this very place
a feeling of happiness
that i could always have
what are you doing
im sitting
are you sad
no
are you sick
yes
whats the matter
a need
oh thats it
a double knot is the only way
to make it hold
a need a need of food perhaps
or a need of drink
she isnt gone cassiel i know it
ill find her
something will happen
something important tonight
shell teach me everything
there are other suns then the one
up in the sky cassiel
in the deep of the night
spring will begin today
other wings will grow
in place of the old ones
wings that will at last astound me
it must finally become serious
ive often been alone
but ive never lived alone
when i was with someone
i was often happy
but at the same time
it all seemed a coincidence
these people were my parents
but it could have been others
why was the browneyed one
my brother
and not the greeneyed boy
on the opposite platform
the taxi drivers daughter
was my friend
but i might as well have put
my arm around a horses neck
i was with a man i was in love
and i might as well
have left him there
and gone off with the stranger
we met in the street
look at me or dont
give me your hand or dont
no dont give me your hand
and look away
i think tonight is the new moon
no night more peaceful
no bloodshed in all the city
ive never played with anyone
and yet
i never opened my eyes and thought
now its serious
at last its becoming serious
so ive grown older
was i the only one
who wasnt serious
is it our times that are not serious
ive never been lonely
neither alone nor with someone else
but i would have liked to be lonely
loneliness means i am whole at last
now i can say it
as tonight im lonely at last
i must put an end to coincidence
the new moon of decision
i dont know if there is a destiny
but there is a decision
decide
now we are the times
not only the whole town the whole
world is taking part in our decision
now we are more than the two of us
we incarnate something
we are sitting
on the peoples square
and the whole place is full of people
whose dream is the same as ours
we are deciding everybodys game
i am ready
now its your turn
you hold the game in your hand
now or never
you need me
you will need me
there is no greater story than ours
that of man and woman
it will be a story of giants
invisible transposable
a story of new ancestors
look my eyes
they are the image of necessity
of the future of everyone in the place
last night i dreamt of a stranger
of my man
only with him could i be lonely
open up to him
wholly open wholly for him
welcome him wholly into me
surround him with the labyrinth
of shared happiness
i know
its you
something happened
it is still going on it binds me
it was true at night and its true
in the day even more so now
who was who
i was in her and she was around me
who in the world can claim that he
was ever together with another being
i am together
no mortal child was begot
only an immortal common image
i learned astonishment that night
she came to take me home
and i found home
it happened once
once and therefore forever
the image that we created
will be with me when i die
i will have lived within it
the amazement about the two of us
amazement about man and woman
has turned me into a human being
i know now
what
no angel knows
name the men women and children
who will look for me
