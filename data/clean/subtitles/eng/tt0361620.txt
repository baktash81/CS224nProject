parties for her very closest companions 
mr  elephant  have you met my daddy 
he s the governor  you know 
  and then it happened 
    man  ntroducing president  
you know that awkward
but typical time oflife   
  when you feel like every eye is on you  
    man   mackenzie  
like you re the main attraction
in a three ring circus 
that s right 
she became a teenager 
but eventually 
she made it through 
and as she blossomed  she became
more comfortable with herself 
  there she is  hey  sam  how you doing

hi  sweetie  l d like you to meet  
and like most teenagers 
she enjoyed parties   
  and pizza

she often felt as ifher every move
was scrutinized 
  hold it right there 
  big smile  sam 
mom  promise me you would never let me
leave the house looking like that 
never  lt looks like she found
chelsea clinton s old crimping iron   
and amy carter s sassoons 
it s like a terrorist
got a hold of her 
i don t know what s going on 
but what do you think 
what is the worst outfit that you have
ever seen samantha wear

there have been
a lot of lousy outfits 
 f mac is back  get in there
and clean out your kid s closet 
    narrator   but with maturity   
  thank you 
    speaking french  
  she was able to look outside herself   
and appreciate the wisdom
ofher elders 
and l ll tell you something 
decades in politics give you   
special life skills  sam 
like an excellent poker face 
    laughs  
  not bad  senator downer 
  thank you for the tip 
    laughter  
  narrator  
 n short   
  she grew up    happily

my adorable collegiate car   
next to my cooler that has a beer hiding
underneath the bologna sandwiches 
my parents cry 
their only child is growing up and so forth 
and then i do it 
i drive off like the normal 
run of the mill kid that i am 
you re still a princess 
you should at least wear a ball gown 
ignorance is bliss 
what can i say 
i say  good night 
normal  boring girl 
and you better hide that beer 
because under the sandwiches  
that s the first place
they ll look 
  duly noted 
  good night 
    door closes  
    sighs  
  running footsteps  
did you take the southern route
through the stairwell   
or the northern route
through the access hall 
  eastern route 
  oh 
two elevators  one moving walkway 
turn left at the lincoln arches 
  lt s lesser known  but very effective 
  mm hmm 
eastern route s one of
my favorites  actually 
and that lincoln arches thing
is a very nice touch 
you know  if you re gonna
eat this cake   
you have to pay the toll 
  lnflation

secret service men carrying my books  then  
uh huh 
all l m saying  
i just wanna be
like everybody else 
sam  you re not like
everybody else 
ready 
it s the big finish

your major  and you ll say

you can segue into your education
reform initiative from there 
and time permitting  mr  president

zip it  bock 
and  dylan 
especially you 
not another word 
  hinge creaks  
  zipping  
look  if you re gonna be going through
my stuff at least you can help me carry it 
are you aware there are two huge
individuals with stun guns   
sticky hands and no manners
flanking our door 
  you must be mia

you re not as tall in person 
i m really excited about this year 
there s so many things i wanna do 
  no offense  miss mackenzie  
  samantha 
samantha  
but i have a plan   
  of college 
  that s great 
look  l m just trying to have
a normal college experience  okay 
  all i want is normal  mia 
  right 
i m going to
the housing office 
they said you were the kind of girl
who was up for anything 
i m disappointed 
  you re manipulating me 
  yes 
it s kinda working 
please  mia 
just give it a shot 
that s all l m asking 
well  the situation
could have its advantages 
absolutely 
like  in case of a national emergency   
guess who gets a free seat
on the chopper 
i was kind of thinking your secret service
could get us beer 
  you can forget about that 
  we ll work on it 
mia thompson 
arkansas royalty 
i didn t know they had
royalty in arkansas 
course we do 
my dad s a king 
i mean  he s had
a few queens since my mom  but  
you know  tire king  
best seller of the south 
cool  this is bock  dylan s outside 
they re protecting us 
could that involve tackling me 
 cause the bald one s a little sexy 
and you can forget
about that too 
  laughs  
yeah 
look  bonus points for giving me the good bed 
i like you already 
but just to let you know 
don t kiss my ass 
 cause i certainly
won t be kissing yours 
mia  i like you already 
it s our first day 
i m trying to have fun 
why don t you change clothes 
we can go hang out  go to some parties 
meet some guys 
definitely meet some guys 
my night s scheduled already 
i thought i looked okay  no 
oh  yeah  sure  lf you re trying
to hang out with the dean 
miss mackenzie    speak
for the entire faculty   
when   say 
 welcome to redmond    
and i assure you
that you ll be treated just like any student   
just the minute we conclude
this elaborate party in your honor 
  woman    n the sense they would
support preferred policy 
of course  the fundamental
importance of agenda control   
was established by mckelvey   
irrespective of implications
for the final outcome 
 n fact  one ofhis
most notable papers showed   
that the one person  one vote   
system of voting   
did not always lead to a middle ground
in decision making 
the manipulation of agenda could have
a great impact on policy making 
  continues  fades  
you missed a great party 
  sorry about that 
  fortunately  i can provide you   
with another normal
college experience   
in which the roommate
kicks you out in the name of  
  grunts  
higher education 
can i just get my  
  come back in two 
  minutes 
hours

her secret service backed off 
they blended in 
they wore birkenstocks 
sam  i want you
to listen to me 
a navy blue suit with birkenstocks

that was another time 
this is a real different world
we live in  sam 
it is not like i am sleeping around

his frequent flier miles   
samuels is right here 
right now at home 
health care 
education  new jobs

my father s administration   
gives a great deal of attention
to his domestic agenda 
  take his college tuition  
  blah  blah  blah  end of sound bite 
it s kind of hard to get that stuff
out of your head  huh 
well  i know only one thing

i should change 
i don t wanna ruin the outfit

mia thompson 
ladies and gentlemen 
suffice it to say  your father feels like
he gave you an inch  and you took a mile 
i know 
l l completely understand  l m  
listen to me  sam 
you cannot pull a stunt like this again 
  whispering   look    don t know
who you re groveling to   
but the best thing about college
is you can hang up 
  put him on 
  are you crazy  he s on fire 
look  liz  l ll just say   dad  i love you 
this is unfortunate  but    
  go ahead  l m listening 
  hi  dad

what were you thinking  sam 
i know 
yes  it s the roommate  mia 
just so we re clear  she s the one
in the really uncomfortable looking  
  thong 
  ln a thong 
  correct 
  okay  put her on 
  sighs   mr  president 
mia thompson here 
now  with all due respect  although i do
think your diplomatic skills are top notch   
i think you really need
some serious parenting advice 
really 
you know what  mia 
i could not agree
with you more 
  what 
  lt s great to know   
my daughter is living with
such a sensible young woman 
you ve got that rare thing  mia 
you know what it is  lt s character 
some people have it  some people don t 
you have it 
really  thanks 
um  i mean  you too 
that whole china thing was real good 
yeah  i can   i can definitely see
how you do what you do 
i will  bye 
  he s good  isn t he 
  yeah 
next time  you should be
a little easier on him 
okay  but the difference is
he s my president and he s your father 
not when he s calling
from the oval office  he s not 
oval office  schmoval office 
at some point  every father s gotta
learn to let go of his little girl 
and every little girl s gotta
learn to let go of her father 
how do you do that  mia

    man  2   oh yeah 
  i don t believe that s any of your business 
  continues  lndistinct  
what s going on  mia 
what s going on is
this isn t working out 
it s too hard 
is it that you don t like living
with all the attention  mia 
  or that you don t like living without it 
  excuse me 
i think you re used to being
the center of things 
as a matter of fact  i am 
naturally 
normally 
what you got going on
is a whole lot of genetic limelight 
i think that you re acting
really unreasonably right now 
so why don t we just step outside 
maybe calm down 
no  l m not counting to 10 
i m not writing up some itinerary 
right here  right now 
let s have this out 
and for once  sam 
say something that you wanna say   
and not what someone wrote for you 
just be you 
whoever that is 
this from a woman who will kiss
anyone with lips   
but saves abstinence for the one person
she really cares about 
well  you know what 
at least i can admit l m messed up 
you re so desperate to make everybody like
you  you let people use me to get to you   
and then you act like
you don t see what s happening 
you let people use you 
regardless of whether i am around  mia 
you make that choice all of the time   
so don t blame your
genetically lit roommate 
and don t draw on my parents

my life will never be normal 
and what exactly
is so bad about that 
the last time i had privacy
i was in utero 
  snickers   lmagine what it s like to have
your whole life picked out for you 
imagine    never being alone
and always feeling lonely 
all   ever wanted
was to get my key   
get in a beat up little volkswagen 
and drive off to college 
you think l m a silly  spoiled kid 
completely devoid of gratitude 
actually  i think i completely understand
what you re going through 
  you do 
  this one time

  had to avoid the press 
the paparazzi

let s say you do
please your father   
and you are completely successful
and completely self reliant

samantha  is

    door closes  
  been a three point drop in the polls   
since your little table dance 
is it that bad 
you ve gotta know that we are
in the race of our lives 
we were elected to set an example 
they expect more of us 
that s the life we ve chosen 
i didn t choose anything  mom 
and i didn t run for anything 
nobody elected me  remember 
like it or not  chosen or not   
you are the daughter
of the president of the united states

you want me to leave school

  footsteps approaching  
good evening  miss 
i guess you heard 
samantha mackenzie raising money   
for her dad s reelection
one dollar at a time 
  laughter  applause  
yes  ladies and gentlemen 
that s   that s the big story 
here s the best part 
the secret service agent   
who knocked out the guy at the bar
where samantha was stripping  
turns out  that secret service agent
is her boyfriend 
        fades  
    audience   ooh  
and with the help of hard workin  people
like you  we can win this thing 
  thank you  motor city 
    cheering  
  chanting   mackenzie  
mackenzie     continues  
  man   we re here to discuss your proposed
removal as a disciplinary action 
your record is exceptional 
but looking at this report   
i have my doubts about your ability
to continue as an agent 
i understand 
so please tell this panel why we should
allow you to continue as an agent 
my father was an agent 
  and my grandfather was before  
  but they re not the ones
under review here  you are 
and if you had a different father
or grandfather  you wouldn t
have this opportunity 
you know  as a little kid   
i always dreamt about standing on the
sidelines of history  protecting others  
maybe even the president himself 
well  i had the opportunity
to protect a pretty remarkable person 
do you have anything to say
to defend your actions 
you trained me
to expect the unexpected 
and i tried    not to feel anything 
i tried to keep my distance   
but l   
fell deeper    and deeper 
 fhaving those feelings
means losing myjob   
then that s a loss
i am prepared to take 
you and i know that mistakes made in our
line of work could mean someone s life 
so l m sorry 
you ll be on suspension
pending your removal   
and you should start to think
about other alternatives 
    staff members chattering low  
    man     his humor  his charisma 
  woman  
have we confirmed these numbers 
    chatter continues  
  and did she sign for them 
  well  the only thing  
  well  that s why we chose this venue 
  new hampshire worked  right 
  we re not in new hampshire anymore 
  most people want to hear
about foreign markets 
  pardon me 
  hey  how are you doin  
  good 
you okay 
sam   
you re unhappy 
i get it  but if you re going
to be here  be here 
because there s a lot at stake   
and i really need you to act
like a grown up right now 
obviously  i understand
there is a lot at stake  dad 
i have been standing by your side
with mom my entire life 
that s why i came home 
you don t have to tell me how important
it is to be with the people you love 
i am here  lf you want me to be
a grown up  then you have to allow it 
  tapping on microphone  feedback  
  what s goin  on with sam 
  uh  
  what is it 
  well   
remember when she was little
and she found that frog   
and we wouldn t let her keep it   
and she got that really stubborn little   
unbelievably cute look on her face 
  yes

man  here i am about to go onstage

and as for our president

  to this country that she s done
to her family   embarrass it 
    switch clicks  
  press secretary   with all due respect 
now that we vejust taken direct hits   
on the domestic agenda  and it s
the last push before the election  
it s too late to change our position 
i don t think we should address it

more important than home
