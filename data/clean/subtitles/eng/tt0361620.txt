im going to
the housing office
they said you were the kind of girl
who was up for anything
im disappointed
youre manipulating me
yes
its kinda working
please mia
just give it a shot
thats all lm asking
well the situation
could have its advantages
absolutely
like in case of a national emergency
guess who gets a free seat

you can forget about that
well work on it
mia thompson
arkansas royalty

oh yeah sure lf youre trying
to hang out with the dean
miss mackenzie  speak
for the entire faculty
when  say
welcome to redmond
and i assure you
that youll be treated just like any student
just the minute we conclude
this elaborate party in your honor
woman  n the sense they would
support preferred policy
of course the fundamental
importance of agenda control
was established by mckelvey
irrespective of implications
for the final outcome
n fact one ofhis
most notable papers showed
that the one person one vote
system of voting
did not always lead to a middle ground
in decision making
the manipulation of agenda could have
a great impact on policy making
continues fades
you missed a great party
sorry about that
fortunately i can provide you
with another normal
college experience
in which the roommate
kicks you out in the name of
grunts

man 2  ohyeah
i dont believe thats any of your business
continues lndistinct
whats going on mia
whats going on is
this isnt working out
its too hard
is it that you dont like living
with all the attention mia
or that you dont like living without it
excuse me
i think youre used to being
the center of things
as a matter of fact i am
naturally
normally
what you got going on
is a whole lot of genetic limelight
i think that youre acting
really unreasonably right now
so why dont we just step outside
maybe calm down
no lm not counting to 10
im not writing up some itinerary
right here right now
lets have this out
and for once sam
say something that you wanna say
and not what someone wrote for you
just be you
whoever that is
this from a woman who will kiss
anyone with lips
but saves abstinence for the one person
she really cares about
well you know what
at least i can admit lm messed up
youre so desperate to make everybody like
you you let people use me to get to you
and then you act like
you dont see whats happening
you let people use you
regardless of whether i am around mia
you make that choice all of the time
so dont blame your
genetically lit roommate
and dont draw on my parents
its not nice

woman on speaker
after samantha mackenzies
table dance last night
a shroud of embarrassment
surrounds the white house today
all murmuring
lets go live tojeff michael as he
tells us more about her alleged affair
michael  the white house
has no comment regarding
a jealous brawl involving
samantha mackenzie
nor do they have anything to say
about her alleged relationship
with one ofher
secret service agents
reporting live
from redmond university
sobbing
door opens
what are you doing here
chuckles
well the question on my mind
samantha is
what have you been doing here
door closes
been a threepoint drop in the polls
since your little table dance
is it that bad
youve gotta know that we are
in the race of our lives
we were elected to set an example
they expect more of us
thats the life weve chosen
i didnt choose anything mom
and i didnt run for anything
nobody elected me remember
like it or not chosen or not
you are the daughter
of the president of the united states
your father and i need you
now we need to be the first family
you want me to leave school
when president harding was elected
florence harding said
warren i got you the presidency

so lets get your father
the presidency again

audience  ooh

thank you motor city
cheering
chanting  mackenzie
mackenzie  continues
man  were here to discuss your proposed
removal as a disciplinary action
your record is exceptional
but looking at this report
i have my doubts about your ability
to continue as an agent
i understand
so please tell this panel why we should
allow you to continue as an agent
my father was an agent
and my grandfather was before
but theyre not the ones
under review here you are
and if you had a different father
or grandfather you wouldnt
have this opportunity
you know as a little kid
i always dreamt about standing on the
sidelines of history protecting others
maybe even the president himself
well i had the opportunity
to protect a pretty remarkable person
do you have anything to say
to defend your actions
you trained me
to expect the unexpected
and i tried not to feel anything
i tried to keep my distance
but l
fell deeper and deeper
fhaving those feelings
means losing myjob
then thats a loss
i am prepared to take
you and i know that mistakes made in our
line of work could mean someones life
so lm sorry
youll be on suspension
pending your removal
and you should start to think
about other alternatives
staff members chattering low
man his humor his charisma
woman
have we confirmed these numbers
chatter continues
and did she sign for them
well the only thing
well thats why we chose this venue
new hampshire worked right

about foreign markets
pardon me
hey how are you doin
good
you okay
sam
youre unhappy

to be here be here
because theres a lot at stake
and i really need you to act
like a grownup right now

i have been standing by your side
with mom my entire life
thats why i came home
you dont have to tell me how important
it is to be with the people you love
i am here lf you want me to be
a grownup then you have to allow it
tapping on microphone feedback
whats goin on with sam
