under what extraordinary circumstances
would you allow that to happen 
a woman could trust me   
   as long as her interests
didn t run too contrary to my own 
and society  at large 
if its interests were to run
counter to your own

oh  yes 
mikey 
  hi  find the chopper 
  abandoned in queens 
  we know where it was stolen 
  probably some pad in the hamptons 
mr lenox 
mr lenox is the director of the museum 
detective michael mccann 
i m sorry to be here  sir 
who are the actors 
four  foreign  probably eastern
european  no print records 
illegals  check with interpol 
the russian government might help 
in the works  point of entry
was a statue delivered this morning 
brought in with their own security 
next you ll say it was a horse 
  a trojan horse 
  bingo 
  someone has a sense of humour 
  we ve three digits of the truck plate 
  this place been hit before 
  they just lost their cherry 
mr lenox  was it just the one painting 
but such an important one 
a seminal work  a historical watershed 
it s truly irreplaceable 
great neighbourhood 
some broads here are wearing my salary 
so the skylight was rigged to blow 
yeah  and there were cargo nets
spread out  ready to use 
they wore rappelling harnesses
under their clothes 
okay  right 
right  let s just track
this thing through  so   
   they kill the air  make the place
uncomfortable  drive out the tourists 
they lower these gates
so nobody can get in 
they lower the paintings
into the cargo nets  pull the paintings   
   ditch the frames  and figure
they ll fly out of here like peter pan 
but somebody makes them early 
chopper takes off 
some make it  some don t 
basically  amateur night  right 
what s that 
it was wedged under the gate 
and 
not exactly samsonite 
titanium  the engineer said   
   it d have to absorb 15 to 20 tons
to stop this gate 
 footsteps 
 woman  seems there may be
a couple of holes in your theory 
they shut off the air to drive out the
tourists  then escort them out anyway 
then they close the gates
to keep everybody out   
   but block one of them open while
they prepare to load  conservatively   
   1 000 pounds of paintings and 800
pounds of men that we know about   
   in a  um   
what was the chopper model 
  sikorsky s 76 
  right 
in a chopper
with a 600 pound useful load

  okay  skip forward to the robbery 
  time of the robbery 
  whoa  zip 
was the camera working 
or did they cut the feed 
oh 
 chuckles  no 
that s why they cut the air 
that could be  these things need
a ten degree difference 
if the ambient temperature
gets within ten degrees of the bodies   
   the camera can t tell
between people and walls 
how hot did it get 
check the other cameras 
so  why can you see
people in this room 
the ambient in that wing
only went up to the mid 80s 
okay  wait a minute

that for some reason   
   the area around that particular painting

 distant voices 
 indistinct french 
  you complimented me 
  how 
  they were bankers

 chuckles  who  the suits 
you re transferring assets

to fail

i d teach you 
you really think there s
happy ever after for people like us 
so just how big of a thief are you

   l m just an amateur 
beginner s luck  huh 
gentleman jockey wins the derby 
something like that 
you got your hand caught
in the cookie jar now 
how are you gonna get out of it 
 crown sighs  it s just a game  love 
 whispers  just a game 
  nice tan 
  thanks 
i went to the beach for a couple of days 
on the job 
that s right 
and did you pick anything    up 
well  he s got an ornament   
   worn by barbarossa
at his coronation in 1152 
really  stolen 
no 
so that s it  after two days   
   and two nights 
that was it 
would you like to know where he was
the night before you left 
or after he left you last night 
not really 
okay  suit yourself 
michael 
 whispers  oh   
   she s  er   
   striking 
he seems to think so 
three dates in six days 
well   
   where does he find the time 
you okay 
yeah 
you know  i was okay once 
my girlfriend  er  got drunk 
stayed out all night 
came back in the morning    married 
yeah 
i told people i didn t care    and then i   
   fucked five women in three days 
flipped my car on an on ramp   
   beat a suspect unconscious 
got suspended 
but um    i was okay 
is there a point to this story 
but he was with him 
what s this 
photos of the monet s borders 
the borders 
insurers remove a painting from the frame
to photograph its borders 
borders are never seen in galleries
or auctions  so if a picture s stolen and   
   someone makes a forgery 
the borders won t match 
and if they do happen to match 
then the forger
was in the presence of the original 
  so  if crown s prank monet is too good   
  then we find the forger   
   and nail the bastard 
  how long have you had these 
  five days 
and you didn t open them 
yeah  well  they re open now 
  it s beautiful 
  you re not going to say   
    i couldn t possibly  
no 
i  er   
   i wouldn t say anything that boring 
she s an old friend   
   but it ll be like
having dinner in a morgue 
but you know  it occurred to me  i might
be able to bear it if you came with me 
tomorrow  that s so soon 
i sense hesitation 
no   
no 
  do you find my company monotonous 
   laughs  no 
cos i d hate to think you could 
what  be bored by you 
require a little variety 
you re referring to anna 
they photographed me with anna 
  you know  that s your prerogative 
  i thought they were 
i let it happen 
  want to know why 
  no 
  i ll tell you 
  don t 
  i want to tell you 
  i don t want to know 
jimmy  i d like to get out 
  keep driving 
  stop 
  i don t want to know why 
  let me tell you 
  no 
  ah  shit 
  now ask me why 
  i don t want to know 
  you re upset about it 
  yeah  cos you wanted me to be upset 
  i needed you to be upset 
  ho ho  he s sadistic  who knew 
  did it occur to you i needed to know 
  know what  
know whether all it was to you   
   was the painting 
how else could i know 
what about you 
i can leave here tomorrow 
so can you 
  we d be fugitives 
  fugitives with means 
all the difference in the world 
 whispers  i don t know 
i don t know 
oh dear  peter pan decides to grow up 
and finds there s no place to land 
the only sad part is   
   if she s anything like you   
   she won t know what she s lost
until it s gone 
hey  let s go 
where 
the borders matched perfectly 
then again  i m sure you knew that 
didn t you 
come on  let s go meet some forgers 
i was never an lmpressionist 
anyway  i pay taxes now 
doing what 
portraits 
inserting the rich into old masterpieces 
  the wife s face on the mona lisa 
  hmm 
from brooklyn to greenwich
in one generation 
you ve gotta have the paintings to match 
so  who did it 
the german 
heinrich   
 catherine  knutzhorn 
art s a small world  michael 
so  who do you think did this 
frederick golchan 
he said you did 
so you think if i want paint 
it just comes fed ex 
and the guards just think it s therapy   
   while i madly copy a monet
in my cell from the original 
what 
what 
nothing 
what  
i was just wondering
about what he wouldn t say 
give 
there s nothing 
you know what 
life is full of shitty conflicts  okay  give 
i just wondered if there was
a connection between them  that s all 
between crown and that old man 
yeah 
  you are spooky  you are really spooky 
  they owned a gallery together   
   crown and knutzhorn  in berlin  1990 
another one in hamburg 
and one in paris in  94 
you notice the one man show
in paris in  95 
the artist is knutzhorn 
so 
so look at the first name 
tyrol knutzhorn 
yeah  we spoke to a heinrich 
you know what it was 
the way he smiled at the painting 
pride 
paternal pride 
i bet you it s his son 
son of a great forger 
who paints as well as dad 
just hasn t been caught yet 
well  i assume if you look   
   you ll find tyrol knutzhorn
lives in new york 
you know what 
i    er  i owe you an apology 
i didn t think you had the chops
to see this through 
you don t know me 
yeah  but i should have  cos   
i bet you d stand at the pearly gates   
   and kick st peter in the teeth
before you d let someone play you 
harold  listen carefully
and please don t interrupt 
if i had to be gone  and i mean
seriously gone  in about eight hours   
   how much could i take with me 
  are you okay  
  harold   
you d take an enormous loss  
liquidating like this  
i understand  and that can t be helped 
what could i leave with 
call me in an hour  
i ll have a number for you  
okay 
leaving us 
no  you re not that lucky 
i m organising 
no knutzhorn has been
to see the old man 
no 
there was a knudsen  though 
three times last month 
think that s a coincidence  or    
could be 
yeah 
probably is 
hmm 
look  here s an extra hundred 
  just go  go 
   hooting 
  paul  is he here 
  he s in a meeting now 
  it s very important 
  if you wait in the living room  i ll get him

anna works for me 
you never thought i was a fool before 
i owe her money

i would be compromising her to say 
oh  tommy  you re going away together

of all the things in the world
to take with a leap of faith   
   how can i possibly trust you 
  i m not gonna ask that
