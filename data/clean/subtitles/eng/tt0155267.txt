women
youve yet to talk about women
oh i enjoy women
enjoyment isnt intimacy
intimacy isnt necessarily enjoyment
how would you know
has it occurred to you
that you have a problem with trust
i trust myself implicitly
yes but can other people trust you
you mean society at large
i mean women mr crown
yes a woman could trust me
could
under what extraordinary circumstances
would you allow that to happen
a woman could trust me
as long as her interests
didnt run too contrary to my own
and society at large
if its interests were to run
counter to your own

good evening sir
hey paul
you want to put this in the study
i set out a bottle of wine
thank you
ha i may have won a cruise
oh yes
mikey
hi find the chopper
abandoned in queens
we know where it was stolen
probably some pad in the hamptons
mr lenox
mr lenox is the director of the museum
detective michael mccann
im sorry to be here sir
who are the actors
four foreign probably eastern
european no print records
illegals check with interpol
the russian government might help
in the works point of entry
was a statue delivered this morning
brought in with their own security
next youll say it was a horse
a trojan horse
bingo
someone has a sense of humour
weve three digits of the truck plate
this place been hit before
they just lost their cherry
mr lenox was it just the one painting
but such an important one
a seminal work a historical watershed
its truly irreplaceable
great neighbourhood
some broads here are wearing my salary
so the skylight was rigged to blow
yeah and there were cargo nets
spread out ready to use
they wore rappelling harnesses
under their clothes
okay right
right lets just track
this thing through so
they kill the air make the place
uncomfortable drive out the tourists
they lower these gates
so nobody can get in
they lower the paintings
into the cargo nets pull the paintings
ditch the frames and figure
theyll fly out of here like peter pan
but somebody makes them early
chopper takes off
some make it some dont
basically amateur night right
whats that
it was wedged under the gate
and
not exactly samsonite
titanium the engineer said
itd have to absorb 15 to 20 tons
to stop this gate
footsteps
woman seems there may be
a couple of holes in your theory
they shut off the air to drive out the
tourists then escort them out anyway
then they close the gates
to keep everybody out
but block one of them open while
they prepare to load conservatively
1000 pounds of paintings and 800
pounds of men that we know about
in a um
what was the chopper model
sikorsky s76
right
in a chopper
with a 600pound useful load
you er figure youll wrap this

thats why they cut the air
that could be these things need
a ten degree difference
if the ambient temperature
gets within ten degrees of the bodies
the camera cant tell
between people and walls
how hot did it get
check the other cameras
so why can you see
people in this room
the ambient in that wing

not really
okay suit yourself
michael

striking
he seems to think so
three dates in six days
well
where does he find the time
you okay
yeah
you know i was okay once
my girlfriend er got drunk
stayed out all night
came back in the morning married
yeah
i told people i didnt care and then i
fucked five women in three days
flipped my car on an onramp
beat a suspect unconscious
got suspended
but um i was okay
is there a point to this story
but he was with him
whats this
photos of the monets borders
the borders
insurers remove a painting from the frame
to photograph its borders
borders are never seen in galleries
or auctions so if a pictures stolen and
someone makes a forgery
the borders wont match
and if they do happen to match
then the forger
was in the presence of the original
so if crowns prank monet is too good
then we find the forger
and nail the bastard
how long have you had these
five days
and you didnt open them
yeah well theyre open now
its beautiful
youre not going to say
i couldnt possibly
no
i er
i wouldnt say anything that boring
shes an old friend
but itll be like
having dinner in a morgue
but you know it occurred to me i might
be able to bear it if you came with me
tomorrow thats so soon
i sense hesitation
no
no
do you find my company monotonous
laughs no
cos id hate to think you could
what be bored by you
require a little variety
youre referring to anna

i let it happen
want to know why
no
ill tell you

i want to tell you
i dont want to know
jimmy id like to get out
keep driving
stop
i dont want to know why
let me tell you
no
ah shit
now ask me why
i dont want to know
youre upset about it
yeah cos you wanted me to be upset
i needed you to be upset
hoho hes sadistic who knew
did it occur to you i needed to know
know what
know whether all it was to you
was the painting
how else could i know
what about you
i can leave here tomorrow
so can you
wed be fugitives
fugitives with means
all the difference in the world
whispers i dont know
i dont know
oh dear peter pan decides to grow up
and finds theres no place to land
the only sad part is
if shes anything like you
she wont know what shes lost
until its gone
hey lets go
where
the borders matched perfectly
then again im sure you knew that
didnt you
come on lets go meet some forgers
i was never an lmpressionist
anyway i pay taxes now
doing what

youve gotta have the paintings to match
so who did it
the german
heinrich
catherine knutzhorn
arts a small world michael
so who do you think did this
frederick golchan
he said you did
so you think if i want paint
it just comes fed ex
and the guards just think its therapy
while i madly copy a monet
in my cell from the original
what
what
nothing
what
i was just wondering
about what he wouldnt say
give
theres nothing
you know what
life is full of shitty conflicts okay give
i just wondered if there was
a connection between them thats all
between crown and that old man
yeah
you are spooky you are really spooky
they owned a gallery together
crown and knutzhorn in berlin 1990
another one in hamburg
and one in paris in 94
you notice the oneman show
in paris in 95
the artist is knutzhorn
so
so look at the first name
tyrol knutzhorn
yeah we spoke to a heinrich
you know what it was
the way he smiled at the painting
pride
paternal pride
i bet you its his son
son of a great forger
who paints as well as dad
just hasnt been caught yet
well i assume if you look
youll find tyrol knutzhorn
lives in new york
you know what
i er i owe you an apology
i didnt think you had the chops
to see this through
you dont know me
yeah but i should have cos
i bet youd stand at the pearly gates
and kick st peter in the teeth
before youd let someone play you
harold listen carefully
and please dont interrupt
if i had to be gone and i mean
seriously gone in about eight hours
