frank griffith please 
hi 
it s a local call 
it s personal 
bridget 
  always a pleasure 
  you still a lawyer frank 
yeah  you still a self serving bitch 
a friend needs advice 
i ll set it up for you 
a husband and wife do a one time drug deal 
  the goal s a wholesome one 
college fund for the kids 
no  the wife wants new digs 
comes off without a hitch 
only the wife decides that the new house
 would be happier without the husband 
sharing was never her speciality 
she s anxious to start spending 
well  it s just an opinion since you re not paying for it 
but the husband is entitled to half of
whatever you buy with that cash 
in fact as soon as you turn it into a legal asset
like a condo or a house or a bank account
he can make a claim on it 
what are you saying 
my lips moving too fast for you 
not fast enough  as i recall 
now  now  keep it in cash 
he s not gonna ask a judge for half of that unless he wants
to spend 20 years in attica with somebody s dick up his ass 
so  what   hold onto it for how long 
well  as long as it takes to er 
finalise the divorce 
how long does that take 
he ll fight it   maybe 2 years 
less if you re lucky 
jesus  frank 
well i m sorry the law doesn t make it more 
convenient foryou to steal and deal drugs  bridget

wendy kroy  wendy kroy 
you are beautiful 
  i got your note 
  5 days ago 
  apology appreciated 
  apology expired 
a woman has to protect her standing at
the office  you know that 
look  i was wrong to touch you but you were
wrong to send me to the gas chamber 
so  maybe i over reacted a little bit 
you    wanna see my new place 
on your back 
i thought we were going to be more than sex
partners  i thought we were going to be friends 
and this entails 
talking  sharing  clueing me in to whatever
it is that makes you run so hot and cold 
  can i trust you 
  you know you can trust me 
ok  here it goes  someone steals a million bucks
but  there s a dilemma   she spends it 
ah  you see this is exactly what i m talking about 
you re scared to talk about real things 
you re scared to reveal yourself 
tell me something i wanna know 
tell me what brought you to beston 
i don t know mike  what brought me to beston 
you re so god damned intuitive  you tell me 
i tell you what wendy 
why don t we talk about me  huh 
good 
i m er  i m a claims adjuster 
i talk to all different types of people in my job 
some are happy to be hearing from me 
some are scared to death 
a car s been stolen  a child s operation s been botched 
they tell me things that they don t tell anyone else 
it s very intimate 
it s boring 
no wendy  it s intimate 
i talked to a woman the other day whose
husband just died in a car accident 
it was just a fifty grand payout 
but she said if she knew it was that much
she d have killed the guy herself years ago 
said it was the best thing that
ever happened to her 
you see what i m saying 
i talk to this lady for 20 minutes 
and i know more about her than i know about you 
her husband sounds like a real gem 
actually he was a son of a bitch 
i could tell from his credit report 
you can t tell that from a credit report 
sure you can 
you can tell lots of things from a credit report 
yeah  like what 
he had three credit cards  authorised to three
different women  none of which were his wife 
what else 
they lived in the suburbs but there was an apartment 
in his name only  in the city 
  she wanted him dead 
  she was happy when he ended up that way 
uh huh  he was cheating on her and you could tell
from the credit report 
pretty much so 
we can make a list 
a list 
it s like when i got here   they were gonna
use the phone book to prospect some customers 
it was a total waste of time 
why s that 
the phone book s random 
you gotta make a list tailored to the
people who are more likely to buy your product 
mm hmm  and what type of list are we trying to make 
a cheating husband list 
what do you wanna pitch to cheating husbands 
nothing  i wanna pitch to their wives 
why 
murder 
murder  oh  that s very nice   
your customer said she wanted her husband dead  right 
so  there must be others 
  and you re just gonna sell it to  em 
  i m going to try 
there  men carrying credit unavailable
to their spouses
but available to women 
other than their daughters 
owning a home  and renting an apartment
in the same metropolitan area 
  it s a big list 
  it sure is 
cross reference it with inter state policy owners
of quarter of a million or more 
  why 
  profit incentive 
how much  quarter of a million 
done 
244 names 
dial the first one 
  excuse me 
  dial it 
i just wanna see if i can do it 
he s home  next 
hello  may i speak to a mr vincent 
shit  i think i woke her up 
oh  it s late 
cross me for pacific time 
i ll do it 
yes  may i speak to a mr samuel renford please 
oh he s not 
oh  i assume i m speaking with miss sally lindo 
authorised user of his first bank
credit card 
oh  i m sorry mrs renford 
please stop crying ma am 
i m sure there s a good explanation 
oh  i see  he s done it before 
well  you know 
you shouldn t let him get away with this 
well  i know what a friend of mine did 
yeah  she had her husband killed 
yes  there are people who actually
specialise in such cases 
of course there are risks involved
but there are benefits 
well  does he carry life insurance 
yes  i could put you in touch with the right people
but i would have to know you were serious about this 
a definitie commitment 
mrs renford you do know i m kidding  don t you  
you channel that anger and give him
a nice kick in the balls when he gets home 
good night 
it s do able  your turn 
no thankyou  this is your game 
our game  you said you wanted 
to be more than just sex partners 
i do 
commonality mike  we don t 
like to have the same kind of fun 
this is fun 
yeah  it s bending the rules 
playing with people s brains 
yeah  well whatever er   
we can go to my place afterwards

how the fuck do you stay up here 
i mean these people   
i go in the store this morning for cigarettes 
they got ducks under the counter 
what  do they plant these people or do they just grow outta the ground 
and they look at me like   
hell  i don t know 
well  you know  they re not used to seeing guys like you around here
if you    know what i mean 
is it true what they say 
what 
you know    size 
is it true what they say about white women 
  what s that 
  no ass 
oh  come on  i was wondering for real 
let me see it 
fuck you  drive 
i m sorry 
about what 
about your shortcoming 
i m not gonna play this game 
is that why you carry a big gun 
the freudian mind fuck isn t gonna work either 
touchy 
i m sure your woman is very understanding 
exactly how is it that we end this phase of our relationship 
by you showing it to me 
come on  let me see it  i ve never seen one before 
i ll show you my ass 
what makes you think i wanna see your bony ass 
  show me 
  show me 
i m driving  you go first 
nah  you go first 
you ll shut the fuck up if i show you 
i m sure i ll be too stunned to speak 
i don t believe this 
you re crazy 
shit 
ok  there  you happy 
what the hell are you doin  
i ll make sure the press says nothing about your husband 
i really appreciate it 
there s only one more question i need to ask 
i don t mean to pry   
the man with you
appeared to be not entirely in his pants
at the time of impact 
can you tell me what happened
just before you went off the road 
well  like i told you before he tried to
get me to contact my husband and   
i refused of course 
well he became    you know 
motherfucker this  motherfucker that   
like in the movies 
exactly 
next thing i knew   
i only remember bits and pieces of it but he   
the jist of it was that he was going to   
impale me with his
big   
there s another man
waiting to see you when you re through 
i m through here anyway 
thankyou ma am 
you alright 
how was hockey 
i m very sorry i walked away 
wendy  you were just  you were scaring the hell outta me  i mean
the things you were saying  
you weren t serious 
what do you think 
i don t understand you 
yeah  where s the effort to try 
i m very sorry i walked away 
mike  what i suggested i suggested for us 
the only loser in the whole deal is a rich  cheating  wife beating
old bastard 
you re talking about murder 
yeah  so 
oh  i m sorry   it s one of the commandments  right 
think about what you re saying 
is it the morality of murder that bothers you or the personal risk 
murder is wrong 
yeah  unless the president says to do it 
let me ask you this  if you found out lance collier was dead
would you spend your life bringing
his killer to justice 
would you go to his funeral 
  probably not 
  would you feel sorry for him 
no  and this is not the point 
i really like you mike 
but i can t live here forever 
what does that mean 
where re you going 
gotta bring home the bacon 
are you checked out 
did the doctors give you permission to leave 
always looking for the rules  mike 
you want me to er  come in with you 
are you sure

i ll call you whatever i want 
i borrowed a hundred k from a man
whose first and last names end in vowels 
every week i owe him a new ten thousand
dollars in interest
and when i come up just a little short 
he s got this very fun game
that he plays with thumbs 
i hired a private detective for 50

i am perfectly willing to spend all of the money
in hiring a clinical sociopath
to take it from you 
and fuck you through the eye sockets
just for fun 
ok  look   i ll buy a week

i ll send you ten thousand dollars

a little more generous then

i ve given you no reason to trust me 
only a week

i make sure he sees the gun 
i tell him not to say a word 
you hit him hard if he does 
i close any open curtains 
i turn on the lights 
i tell him i m just there to rob the place 
i find a sturdy chair 
i sit him in it  i toss him the cuffs 
i tell him to cuff himself to the chair 
left hand  right hand  left leg  right leg 
make sure i hear the click of the cuffs 
then i er  tell him to open up his mouth 
i gag him  tight 
i then use the gun to knock him out
with a blow to the head 
and i er  keep stabbing him until he s   
dead 
keep going 
i take one final look around  turn off the lights 
i unlock the door  i exit  i shut the door  i lock it 
i ll get the gloves 
why do i have to turn off the lights 
pop psychology

hold it right there pal  hold it

talk fast 
she s my wife 
her name s bridget 
you know her as wendy kroy 
she stole a fortune from me after
making me steal it 
but she s not willing to give it up 
but she can t come back to new york
without settling with me first 
and that s where you come in 
see  she hired you   
wait a minute   
oh  fuck 
you re into her  huh 
it s logical  i guess there aren t
many women fuck like her in cow town 
keep talking 
you re a schizoid  talk to yourself 
you really her husband 
who d she say i was 
foreclosure lawyer 
and you believe that 
it says so on the mailbox 
you re crazy 
it does  it says cahill on the mailbox 
find one other thing in here that   
she s here  she s in new york 
she must have switched the label
on the mailbox 
she must have worked up one hell
of a morality play for you
but you don t like the way it ends 
what are you talking about 
you re supposed to kill cahill 
only it s me 
then she fingers you for the murder 
i don t think so 
oh  she wouldn t lie to you 
denial  ok  i m still cahill 
did she ever happen to mention
that she knows cahill 
so well that he would have a picture
of her in his appartment 
that s a pretty major omission  isn t it 
will you shut up  shut up and let me think 
just shut your mouth 
take your time 
she probably has the cops heading here right now 
she has to know that you ve
actually offed me first 
you re signalling her 
how 
i m calling her later 
she s not in beston  cow boy 
hi  bridge 
so you were gonna have me kill your husband 
i was 
and then tip the police 
  no i wasn t 
  bullshit 
she tells the cops she s reconciling
with me 
that s the suitcase 
shut up  clay 
you have a jealous boyfriend 
it was a great idea bridge 
but i guess mikey wasn t up to it 
what do you say 
is it game  set  match 
who has the key 
i do 
oh  fuck 
funny thing  bridge 
i coulda put this money some place
where you wouldn t have gotten it 
i might have taken you back

you know the role playing thing 
baby you make one hell of a horny nun 
what do you say bridge 
do you wanna stay married 
what are you doing 
oh my god 
now we have a future 
you re not human 
i did it for us  mike

get offa me

rape me  mike 
you re goin  to jail 
trish wasn t really coming to beston  mike 
what did you say 
you shouldn t ve told me you never slept with a man before 
it must ve been some wild night
you getting married so fast 
he couldn t really   
   how to keep the goods hidden
for a whole two days 
what d he do   tell you the little bobbly
thing at the back of your throat was a clitoris 
you married a man 
you farm faggot 
shut your mouth 
i m trish  rape me 
  shut your mouth 
  rape me 
you wanna be raped 
is that what you want 
you wanna fucking be raped 
you wanna play games  ok 
this is 911 
this is 911 
is this what you want 
i m gonna rape you 
i m gonna fucking rape you  bitch 
miss  miss  i m tracing your call right now 
you like it 
don t you wanna be raped 
  you killed my husband 
  god damn right 
you re god damn right 
you killed my husband 
god damn right i did 
alright  miss  miss  i have located you and
i have a car on the way 
  i m trish 
  are you trish  fuck you 
fuck  fucking bitch 
fuck you 
is that what you want 
you like it 
what d you find out 
lance collier exists 
in fact he continues to exist 
he s the guy you described but he isn t dead 
right  so she stole her husband s
money just like he told me 
but the husband never filed a complaint 
look at the d a  s case mike 
you go into a man s apartment with a gun and a knife 
that s intent to kill even if you hadn t confessed it 
the wife is there  your girlfriend 
that s motive 
there s a rape on police tape  along with
a number of murderous threats
all of which goes to establish
a damn tight case 
she gave me the keys to the apartment 
she gave them to me 
they were copies of the originals she possessed 
the jury figures you could have had those made up
at any time 
but   
there s not a trace of anyone s fingerprints
on those keys but yours 
the mace was hers 
i believe you mike 
but a jury s gonna be looking for elecrical outlets 
if we had one piece of hard evidence to support
your version of her maneuverings
that would be enought to raise reasonable doubt 
a note she wrote 
the plane ticket to miami 
phone calls  she made phone calls from my office 
your office  and you made all but one of those calls 
she probably faked that one 
believe me
