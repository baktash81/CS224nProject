frank griffith please
hi
its a local call
its personal
bridget
always a pleasure
you still a lawyer frank
yeah you still a selfserving bitch
a friend needs advice
ill set it up for you
a husband and wife do a onetime drug deal
the goals a wholesome one
college fund for the kids
no the wife wants new digs
comes off without a hitch
only the wife decides that the new house
would be happier without the husband
sharing was never her speciality
shes anxious to start spending
well its just an opinion since youre not paying for it
but the husband is entitled to half of
whatever you buy with that cash
in fact as soon as you turn it into a legal asset
like a condo or a house or a bank account
he can make a claim on it
what are you saying
my lips moving too fast for you
not fast enough as i recall
now now keep it in cash
hes not gonna ask a judge for half of that unless he wants
to spend 20 years in attica with somebodys dick up his ass
so what  hold onto it for how long
well as long as it takes to er
finalise the divorce
how long does that take
hell fight it  maybe 2 years
less if youre lucky
jesus frank

convenient foryou to steal and deal drugs bridget

wendy kroy wendy kroy
you are beautiful
i got your note
5 days ago
apology appreciated
apology expired
a woman has to protect her standing at
the office you know that
look i was wrong to touch you but you were
wrong to send me to the gas chamber
so maybe i overreacted a little bit
you wanna see my new place
on your back
i thought we were going to be more than sex
partners i thought we were going to be friends
and this entails
talking sharing clueing me in to whatever
it is that makes you run so hot and cold
can i trust you
you know you can trust me
ok here it goes someone steals a million bucks
but theres a dilemma  she spends it
ah you see this is exactly what im talking about
youre scared to talk about real things
youre scared to reveal yourself
tell me something i wanna know
tell me what brought you to beston
i dont know mike what brought me to beston
youre so goddamned intuitive you tell me
i tell you what wendy
why dont we talk about me huh
good
im er im a claims adjuster
i talk to all different types of people in my job
some are happy to be hearing from me
some are scared to death
a cars been stolen a childs operations been botched
they tell me things that they dont tell anyone else
its very intimate
its boring
no wendy its intimate
i talked to a woman the other day whose
husband just died in a car accident
it was just a fifty grand payout
but she said if she knew it was that much
shed have killed the guy herself years ago
said it was the best thing that
ever happened to her
you see what im saying
i talk to this lady for 20 minutes
and i know more about her than i know about you
her husband sounds like a real gem
actually he was a son of a bitch
i could tell from his credit report
you cant tell that from a credit report
sure you can
you can tell lots of things from a credit report
yeah like what
he had three credit cards authorised to three
different women none of which were his wife
what else
they lived in the suburbs but there was an apartment
in his name only in the city
she wanted him dead
she was happy when he ended up that way
uhhuh he was cheating on her and you could tell
from the credit report
pretty much so
we can make a list
a list
its like when i got here  they were gonna
use the phone book to prospect some customers
it was a total waste of time
whys that
the phone books random
you gotta make a list tailored to the
people who are more likely to buy your product
mmhmm and what type of list are we trying to make
a cheating husband list
what do you wanna pitch to cheating husbands
nothing i wanna pitch to their wives
why
murder
murder oh thats very nice
your customer said she wanted her husband dead right
so there must be others
and youre just gonna sell it to em
im going to try
there men carrying credit unavailable
to their spouses
but available to women
other than their daughters
owning a home and renting an apartment
in the same metropolitan area
its a big list
it sure is
crossreference it with interstate policy owners
of quarterofamillion or more
why
profit incentive
how much quarter of a million
done
244 names
dial the first one
excuse me
dial it
i just wanna see if i can do it
hes home next
hello may i speak to a mr vincent
shit i think i woke her up
oh its late
cross me for pacific time

yes may i speak to a mr samuel renford please
oh hes not
oh i assume im speaking with miss sally lindo
authorised user of his first bank
credit card
oh im sorry mrs renford
please stop crying maam
im sure theres a good explanation
oh i see hes done it before
well you know
you shouldnt let him get away with this
well i know what a friend of mine did
yeah she had her husband killed
yes there are people who actually
specialise in such cases
of course there are risks involved
but there are benefits
well does he carry life insurance
yes i could put you in touch with the right people
but i would have to know you were serious about this
a definitie commitment
mrs renford you do know im kidding dont you
you channel that anger and give him
a nice kick in the balls when he gets home
good night
its doable your turn
no thankyou this is your game
our game you said you wanted
to be more than just sex partners
i do
commonality mike we dont
like to have the same kind of fun
this is fun
yeah its bending the rules
playing with peoples brains
yeah well whatever er
we can go to my place afterwards

trish
short for
whatever

i thought you were the
one that wanted to talk
you want me to tell you about trish

lance collier financial consultant
retired lives outside miami
charms young waitresses with
luxury apartments and credit cards
while his wife mary beth sits
at home playing solitaire
hes faithful to mary beth in one way
shes the only woman he beats
she doesnt need the money
but she would like to see him die
with a considerable amount of pain
youre crazy
i did a little creative keypunching
and crossreferenced our list parameters
with policy holders at third mutual
you accessed another companys database
and the good news is
our victim does no business with interstate
he has no connection to us mike
wendy you need help
look im gonna go out for a while
you wanna spend the night here thats fine
talk to me
youre deranged
mike the guy deserves it
think about his poor wife
do you know why i left new york
to mess with my mind
fifteen thousand dollars a year is nothing
an apartment youre not afraid to walk out of
rents for half that much
and you have to read the goddamned
obituaries to find it
im going back but i
wont live like an animal
i want you to go back with me
really you do and all i have to do is kill someone
while you go apartment hunting
we can do it together
wendy maybe its my quaint smalltown morals
but i dont do murder
yeah well you would if you loved me
get some sleep
where are you going
im going to play hockey
hockey
ill come with you
youre gonna leave me here by myself
mike wait
im scared
lets go for a little drive
so how is clay
pissed we want our money
what are you two an item
funny woman
youre on a contingency
fifty percent of funds recovered
so why even give clay his half
professionalism
wouldnt it be more pleasant to share it with me
lady you had your fun
whatever you spent you spent
as long as its within reason
but its over
youd get rough
i will if i have to
i cant get it for you tonight
where is it
in a bank
show me a statement
i dont have a statement
but they have this 800 line
you can punch in the account number
get a balance  its a real kick
i imagine pull over at the next phone
i assume that was to get me out of the car
hoping id leave these
twas
so the moneys at your place
tis
how much is left
all but a couple of thou
frugal woman
lets go
well what if i hadnt saved it all
i mean come on you can give me a break
how much
hundred grand i could easily have spent that much
how the fuck do you stay up here
i mean these people
i go in the store this morning for cigarettes
they got ducks under the counter
what do they plant these people or do they just grow outta the ground
and they look at me like
hell i dont know
well you know theyre not used to seeing guys like you around here
if you know what i mean
is it true what they say
what
you know size
is it true what they say about white women
whats that
no ass
oh come on i was wondering for real
let me see it
fuck you drive
im sorry
about what
about your shortcoming
im not gonna play this game
is that why you carry a big gun
the freudian mindfuck isnt gonna work either
touchy
im sure your woman is very understanding
exactly how is it that we end this phase of our relationship
by you showing it to me
come on let me see it ive never seen one before
ill show you my ass
what makes you think i wanna see your bony ass
show me
show me
im driving you go first
nah you go first
youll shut the fuck up if i show you
im sure ill be too stunned to speak
i dont believe this
youre crazy
shit
ok there you happy
what the hell are you doin
ill make sure the press says nothing about your husband
i really appreciate it
theres only one more question i need to ask
i dont mean to pry
the man with you
appeared to be not entirely in his pants
at the time of impact
can you tell me what happened
just before you went off the road
well like i told you before he tried to
get me to contact my husband and
i refused of course
well he became you know
motherfucker this motherfucker that
like in the movies
exactly
next thing i knew
i only remember bits and pieces of it but he
the jist of it was that he was going to
impale me with his
big
theres another man
waiting to see you when youre through
im through here anyway
thankyou maam
you alright

i dont understand you

im very sorry i walked away
mike what i suggested i suggested for us
the only loser in the whole deal is a rich cheating wifebeating
old bastard
youre talking about murder
yeah so
oh im sorry  its one of the commandments right
think about what youre saying
is it the morality of murder that bothers you or the personal risk
murder is wrong
yeah unless the president says to do it
let me ask you this if you found out lance collier was dead
would you spend your life bringing
his killer to justice
would you go to his funeral
probably not
would you feel sorry for him
no and this is not the point
i really like you mike

making me steal it
but shes not willing to give it up
but she cant come back to new york
without settling with me first
and thats where you come in
see she hired you
wait a minute
oh fuck
youre into her huh
its logical i guess there arent
many women fuck like her in cow town
keep talking
youre a schizoid talk to yourself
you really her husband
whod she say i was
foreclosure lawyer
and you believe that
it says so on the mailbox
youre crazy
it does it says cahill on the mailbox
find one other thing in here that
shes here shes in new york
she must have switched the label
on the mailbox
she must have worked up one hell
of a morality play for you
but you dont like the way it ends
what are you talking about
youre supposed to kill cahill
only its me
then she fingers you for the murder
i dont think so
oh she wouldnt lie to you
denial ok im still cahill
did she ever happen to mention
that she knows cahill
so well that he would have a picture
of her in his appartment
thats a pretty major omission isnt it
will you shut up shut up and let me think
just shut your mouth
take your time
she probably has the cops heading here right now
she has to know that youve
actually offed me first
youre signalling her
how
im calling her later
shes not in beston cowboy
hi bridge
so you were gonna have me kill your husband
i was
and then tip the police
no i wasnt
bullshit
she tells the cops shes reconciling
with me
thats the suitcase
shut up clay
you have a jealous boyfriend
it was a great idea bridge
but i guess mikey wasnt up to it
what do you say
is it game set match
who has the key
i do
oh fuck
funny thing bridge
i coulda put this money some place
where you wouldnt have gotten it
i might have taken you back
youre a very funny lady
you know the roleplaying thing
baby you make one hell of a horny nun
what do you say bridge
do you wanna stay married
what are you doing
oh my god
now we have a future
youre not human
i did it for us mike
but he was insured
fuck me mike
what
its a roleplay
youre the intruder
you kill my husband you rape me

youre not gonna kill me bridget
youre gonna kill me if i dont
do what you say right mike
get offa me
get offa me
youre lucky i dont kill you
youre lucky
rape me mike

trish wasnt really coming to beston mike
what did you say
you shouldntve told me you never slept with a man before
it mustve been some wild night
you getting married so fast
he couldnt really
how to keep the goods hidden
for a whole two days
whatd he do  tell you the little bobbly
thing at the back of your throat was a clitoris
you married a man
you farm faggot
shut your mouth
im trish rape me
shut your mouth
rape me
you wanna be raped
is that what you want
you wanna fucking be raped
you wanna play games ok
this is 911
this is 911
is this what you want
im gonna rape you
im gonna fucking rape you bitch
miss miss im tracing your call right now
you like it
dont you wanna be raped
you killed my husband
goddamn right
youre goddamn right
you killed my husband
goddamn right i did
alright miss miss i have located you and
i have a car on the way
im trish
are you trish fuck you
fuck fucking bitch
fuck you
is that what you want
you like it
whatd you find out
lance collier exists
in fact he continues to exist
hes the guy you described but he isnt dead
right so she stole her husbands
money just like he told me
but the husband never filed a complaint
look at the das case mike
you go into a mans apartment with a gun and a knife
thats intent to kill even if you hadnt confessed it
the wife is there your girlfriend
thats motive
theres a rape on police tape along with
a number of murderous threats
all of which goes to establish
a damn tight case
she gave me the keys to the apartment
she gave them to me
they were copies of the originals she possessed
the jury figures you could have had those made up
at any time
but
theres not a trace of anyones fingerprints
on those keys but yours
the mace was hers
i believe you mike
but a jurys gonna be looking for elecrical outlets
if we had one piece of hard evidence to support
your version of her maneuverings
that would be enought to raise reasonable doubt
a note she wrote
the plane ticket to miami
phone calls she made phone calls from my office
your office and you made all but one of those calls
she probably faked that one
believe me
