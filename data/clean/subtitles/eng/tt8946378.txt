to play with him
and if you did that
and you played by his rules
everyone idolizes
their dad right
i dont know
do they
very much not
dont know why
i said that
but my wife linda does
harlan started out
with a rusty smith corona
and built himself into
one of the bestselling
mystery writers of all time

i was happy to have
that night with him
to be by his side
to think about our books
and what weve accomplished
with them
its like i can still feel
his hand on my shoulder
passing the torch
elliott so were here
with joni thrombey
harlan thrombeys
daughterinlaw
mmmhmm
yeah i married his son neil
we had one daughter meg
and then neil passed on
15 years ago
but you remained close
to the thrombeys
oh theyre my family
upbeat music playing
joni i feel
simultaneously freed by
and supported by them
indistinct chatter
its that balance of opposites
thats the nugget of flam
sorry the nugget of
flam
chuckles oh yeah flam
your skincare company sorry
i forgive you
yeah its skincare
but it promotes a total
lifestyle
selfsufficiency with
an acknowledgement
of human need
thats flam
but its also harlan
he got me and meg
through some tough times
grandad gives my mom
a yearly allowance
and hes never missed wiring
a tuition payment
to my schools
hes a genuinely
selfless man
but you left
the party early
meg have fun
to see some friends at smith
you know dad pays for her
cryptomarxistpost
deconstructural
feministpoetrytheory
whatever major
she could have stuck
around for the cake
joni i think linda was upset
hmm
but harlan understood
plays note on piano
right
um you two showed up to the
party around the same time
if i could pause
because i just
who is that guy
and why are we doing
all this again chuckles
elliott this is just some
followup questions
um were attempting
to be thorough
so we can figure out
the manner of death
so by manner of death
you mean if
someone killed him
stutters
if one of us killed him
one of his family killed him
no no walt walt no no
is that what youre
suggesting lieutenant
no ones
saying that okay
this is all
proforma
okay
so who the fuck is that
um
this is
benoit blanc
chuckles benoit blanc
elliott yes
mr blanc is
a private investigator
of great renown
joni wait a minute
i read a tweet about a
new yorker article about you
the last
of the gentlemen sleuths
you solved that case
with the tennis champ
chuckles youre famous
elliott mr blanc is not
with the police department
and not officially involved
in the case
but hes offered to consult
now i happily obliged
and i can vouch for him
mr blanc
i know who you are
i read your profile
in the new yorker
i found it delightful
i just buried
my 85yearold father
who committed suicide
why are you here
clicks tongue im here
at the behest of a client
who
i cannot say
but let me assure you this
my presence
will be ornamental
you will find me a respectful
quiet passive observer
of the truth
fine
are we getting there
nearly um
harlans nurse
she was at the party
in a professional capacity
marta
i guess
harlan hired her
to be around to take care
of whatever medical needs
popped up
but really
shes like part of the family
good kid
been a good friend to harlan
familys from paraguay
linda really likes
her work ethic
immigrants
we get the job done
stutters i
from hamilton
wagner oh hamilton
laughs
its so good
its so good
i saw it at the public
wagner oh
stutters
may i just um
then ill recede but
as a selfmade
man myself
i have to express
my admiration
for how you followed
in your fathers footsteps
thank you
benoit just marvelous
you know
the whole family too
and joni with her thing
and walt with his
publishing empire
stutters its
well
yes i mean walt
hes done well
with what dad gave him
not that it matters
but really dad hands him
a book twice a year
and walt publishes it
its just not the same
but surely walt runs the
merchandising adaptations
film and television rights
i mean
are you baiting me detective
stutters
you know he doesnt
and if you think
i am dumb enough
to be baited into
talking family business
into shittalking
my baby brother
in front of
a police detective
and a state trooper
walt doesnt run shit
because there are no tv
and film rights
harlan never allowed
any adaptations of his books
hated the idea
no
yeah
drives walt nuts
cause thats where
the real money is
when walt would get
a little irish courage in him
hed get into it with harlan
the window is
did he get into it
at the party
oh my god
come on dad
richard wouldnt leave
him alone the poor guy
harlan finally had
to give him the hook
walt the netflix guys
their business affair guy
richard i didnt hear
what he said
but he mustve really
handed him his lunch
cause walt was like a wounded
puppy the rest of the night
what richard said what
no jesus
we did not get into it
im just trying to get
an accurate impression
harlan took you aside
at the party
when you returned
you were chastened
what did harlan say to you
the netflix guys
their business affair guy
he sent something over
its hard numbers this time
and i just think
this is a window
thats not
gonna stay open
we need to take
advantage of it
and then you just need
to look at the numbers
yeah walt look
dad dad
you you put me
in charge of our books
let me be in charge
let me do this please
theyre not
our books son
theyre my books
and this is not how i wanted
to have this conversation
but youre right
youre right
its unfair of me
to keep you tethered
to something that
isnt yours to control
what
no ive done you
a grave disservice
all these years
ive kept you
from building something
of your own
that was yours
but youre not
going to be running
the publishing house
anymore
youre free of it
whoa
dad are you
firing me
no chuckles
well talk
details tomorrow
my minds made up
good boy
we talked we had a business
discussion about ebooks
jesus it was nothing
you want to talk
about an argument
hell ransom had
an argument with him
ransom thats uh
richard and lindas son
walt mmm
look we all love ransom
hes a good kid we love him
but
but hes always been
the black sheep of the family
ah
stutters
and im not trying to
i like to keep stuff like this
in the family
but with ransom
hes never had a job
and dad
for some unknown reason
always supported him
they have this lovehate bond
they fight
but that night god
they had a blowout
about what
ransom
are you goddamn insane
walt we couldnt
make it out really
but it was huge
and its strange they went
into another room to do it
usually they like
to stoke up drama
in front of the whole family
speaking of getting into it
chuckles
you were at the house early
to help the caterers set up did
did you converse with harlan
at that time
well he was there
we must have spoke
in his study
i dont think so
you see i spoke
with the caterer this morning
she didnt see you
helping her staff
she did hear harlan
in a screaming match
with somebody that afternoon
in his study
yeah i dont
screaming match
mmmhmm
no
um clicks tongue
but joni was here too
um she was early
so it might have been her
you can maybe ask her
these were two male voices
harlan shouted the phrase
harlan
you tell her or i will
you tell her
or i will
bells ringing
thats none
of your business
you stay out
of my marriage
i know my daughter
and she would want to know
ive put all of it
in this letter to her
tomorrow she gets it
harlan im warning you
no she deserves to know
you stay out of my marriage
she deserves to know
and youre gonna tell her
the hell i am
you tell her or i will
yes i know
yes
chuckles uh
harlan had finally decided to
put his mom in a nursing home
and linda had
always opposed that
and i wanted to wait
until we got back
to boston uh to tell linda
so to avoid a whole scene
and harlan wanted me
to tell her then
that was it
inhales sharply
sorry forgot
the house
uh early
richard said you were there
i was at the house early
benoit to see harlan
to see harlan
yes
what were you
seeing harlan about
it was just a mixup
with the uh
the payment for megs tuition
im im
im sorry to press
but what kind of mixup
yeah the school hasnt
got the check yet
i dont know why alan
didnt mail it
harlan well
alan didnt mail it
because he caught
a discrepancy
alans office has been wiring
tuition directly to the school
as per your request
but phylliss office that
handles your yearly allowance
has been wiring tuition monies
directly to you as well
you have been doubledipping
megs tuition
and stealing from me
scoffs
100000 a year
for the past four years
harlan i dont know
how this mixup happened
but i swear to god
harlan so now i am writing
this tuition check
but you must know
that this is the last money
you or meg will get from me
please
you dont understand
joni i know itll hurt
but its all for the best
my minds made up
it was uh
a money wiring issue
with the office at the school
so i had to ask harlan to cut
a check for the semester
mmm no big deal
well
why dont we
uh just take
a little break
and well resu
oh no
shes gone
exhales deeply
linda richard
joni have you
seen richard
no i was uh
just done with the um
okay thanks
no
linda damn it richard
richard
chuckles
son of a bitch
see i might be a victim
of my own expectation here
but when
the great benoit blanc
comes knocking
at my door
i expect its going
to be about something
if not extraordinary
then at least interesting
but im sorry
this is an openandshut
case of suicide
and uh quite frankly benny
were getting to the point
where i need to know
what were doing here
benoit the method
throat slit
typical for
a suicide
yes i mean
thats dramatic
but look around
i mean the guy practically
lives in a clue board
elliott come on benny
talk to me all right
now you tell me to invite
all of these people back
for questioning
all over again i get it
wagner listen
ive had boots on the ground
in this county
for a while now
people are generally
what they seem to be
youre not gonna find
murderers in this family
elliott
this is a pleasant family
with the usual quarrels
but no possible motives
for murder
where are you going
gasps
harlan thrombeys nurse
marta
cabrera
marta cabrera please
miss cabrera
you can just wait inside
and well be with you in
benoit miss cabrera
ive been doin
a little pokin
you were hired
on a parttime basis
as a registered
nurse yes
uh yes i dont work for a vna
harlan hired
me directly
take a seat please
and youre paid
a flat rate
for how many hours a week
um
well i started at 15
and then he
he needed more help
medical help
he needed a friend
does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse
elliott all right blanc
i mean this is
yeah yeah marta
we were just discussing
possible motives
in the family
i suspect that
harlan has told you
much unfiltered truth
about each of em
and a little bird
has told me
how shall i
put this delicately
you have
a regurgitative reaction
to mistruthin
chuckles
who told you that
is it true
uh
yes
oh
its something
ive had since i was a kid
its a physical thing
that i shudders
just the thought of lying
yeah it makes me puke
benoit really
both chuckle
thunder rumbling
is richard havin an affair
sighs
why do men instinctively
pull at loose threads
on their parachutes
what
richard
mmmhmm
an affair
yeah
a yes or no will do
mmm no
clicks tongue
scoffs
stomach gurgles
gags
oh shit
retches
wagner oh my god
dear girl im sorry
i assumed you were speaking figuratively
wagner here have some water
i have wetnaps in the car
all right here here
just take a
sip of this
take that
thats quite somethin
hmm
thanks
but i was obviously right
richard is having
an affair
his fatherinlaw found
out and confronted him
you tell her
or i will
okay but even if
that were the case he
marta gags
you all right
yeah
even if that were
the case i mean
protecting a relationship
as a motive
thats weak sauce
you know that
well then there
is joni
joni
joni
lifestyle guru joni
no harlan was supporting
her and her daughter
and thats the
opposite of a motive
and if that support
was threatened
miss cabrera
one moment please
yes i just wanna
get some scope
miss cabrera
door closes
was harlan plannin on
cutting off jonis allowance
oh joni
whats up
stomach gurgles
oh my god
all right dont answer that
if youre gonna
puke again please
meg said he paid
the school directly
joni said he sent
the money to her
both were true
she was pocketing
the double payment
harlan found out
and cut her off
without a cent
yes
wagner so she bumps him off
for the inheritance
come on no
have you seen her insta
shes an influencer
no allowance
as a motive
again more weak sauce
youre just dumpin that vat
of weak sauce on me
granted but she
lied to me
all three of them did
elliott three
walter
ah i see where youre
going with this
harlan had turned walter down
before regarding film rights
but that night somethin
harlan said shook him
now we look at the pattern
harlan was cleanin house
no wonder
did he plan to fire walter
can i just wait inside
i feel like
i shouldnt be here
yeah please
just wait inside
stay close all right
door opens
door closes
benoit you have been
very patient my friend
and yes
you are right
none of these weak alibis
and domestic squibbles
answer your question
why is benoit blanc here
well now i will tell you why
im here because this mornin
someone dodged
a very important question
who
me
linda asked
who hired me
well who hired you
i do not know
an envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday
with a news clippin
of thrombeys death
an envelope
that worked
an envelope of cash
hmm
so somebody
suspects foul play
and goes through this
ha cha dance of hiring me
of staying anonymous
it makes no damn sense
compels me though
walk me through
everyones whereabouts
at the time of death
we know that the party ended
around 1130
harlan good night joni
night
elliott
marta took harlan upstairs
to give him his meds
stairs creaking
the stairs leading
up to harlans bedroom
and his attic office
creak horribly
and linda is a light sleeper
so we know every time
someone took the stairs
that night
chanting in hindi
elliott the first was
when joni heard a kathunk
from somewhere above her
in the house
loud thud
sighs
shes concerned about harlan
so she goes up
to investigate
stairs creaking
waking linda
harlan was in his attic office
with marta
hi joni
i just hi
elliott he explained that
they had just
knocked over the go board
i just knocked over
the go board so
elliott you know that game
with the grid and stones
they play it every night
he was fine go to bed
go to bed joni
love you night
love you
elliott so she did
bye
elliott ten minutes later
linda is awoken
a second time
stairs creaking
by marta leaving
marta walt im leaving
walt was smokin a cigar
on the porch with his son
he saw her leave
and drive off
noted the time
midnight
car door opens and closes
engine starts
fifteen minutes later
linda is awoken for the third
and final time
stairs creaking
by someone coming
down the stairs
harlan who came down
for a midnight snack
walt dad go back to bed
elliott which walt tried
to discourage
based on this
the medical examiner
determined the time of death
to be between
1215 and 200 am
as walt was
finishing his cigar
at about 1230 meg came home
she went straight to bed
walt and jacob
turned in shortly after that
snoring
dogs barking
and sometime later that night
its undetermined
but possibly near 300 am
meg woke up because
the dogs were barking outside
she used the bathroom
went back to bed
thats it all right
now everyones
stories matched
every moment
accounted for
and there is
no other staircase
up to harlans room
none just the creaky one
interesting
wagner so uh we know that
ransom didnt do it
because he
wasnt there
marta couldnt have
harlan was still alive
when she left
yeah
meg
meg came home
during the window
of the time of death right
elliott now look look it was a
except it was a suicide
all right
harlan slit right
through his carotid
we saw from
the blood splat patterns
that they
were uninterrupted
meaning its almost
impossible for anyone
to have been around him
at the time
hes the one who cut his
own throat all right
i dont know why
we keep goin over this
physical evidence
can tell a clear story
with a forked tongue
what
and as we can see
from this mornin
everyone can lie
thunder rumbles
well
almost everyone
chuckles softly
benoit miss cabrera um
we kept you waiting
all afternoon
because i wanted to hear
from you last
i needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head
and your piece of it
is at its very center
so please
take your time
you took mr thrombey
upstairs at 1130
and left at midnight
think very carefully
and with as much detail
as possible

that everything ive
given my family
ive done maybe
without knowing or maybe
to keep them beneath me
i certainly should have
sighs i dont know
encouraged walt
to write his own stories
not just be
a caretaker of mine
like you said i should
and then be a father
and not just a provider
for joni like you
also said
and i could have been kinder
to linda and ransom
sighs
jesus ransom
chuckles

in that kid
confident stupid
i dont know protected
playing life like a game
without consequence
until you cant tell
the difference
between a stage prop
and a real knife

of this before i go

an emergency shot of naloxone
so you dont die

chuckles

an interesting
and efficient
method of murder
i need to write this down
so if someone switched
the meds on purpose
id be dead in 10 minutes
like stonecold dead
yes
youll feel symptoms in five
sweats disorientation
and then
yes that big dose injected
within 10 your
your brain
breathing heavily
yes 10 minutes
from the moment of injection
its eightish now
and even if the victim called
for an ambulance
when he first
felt the symptoms
and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do
the ambulance would take
at least 15 minutes to arrive
and itd be too late
if the victim didnt have
the emergency naxostuff
marta
crying
do you have the naxostuff
yes im gonna find it
i have it because
it comes with the kit
so it should be here
it has to be
its like

take the side yard pass
through the little gate
the dogs will know you
they shouldnt bark

and come in through
the trick hall window
you gotta be kidding me
harlan i am not do it
grunting
and for gods sake
dont make any noise
gasps
breathing heavily
once youre inside
now this is the tricky part
marta
this is the tricky part
harlan get my robe and cap
from my bedroom
and put them on
marta harlan
this is crazy
i dont think i can do that
no we need to make this
so airtight
that the average cop
will entirely dismiss you
as a suspect
it sounds crazy
but itll work
exhales
walt is smoking outside
and hell see you
through the glazed window
walt dad go back to bed
harlan you were seen leaving
the security cameras
show you driving off
and 20 minutes later
im seen alive and well

number one
to an impossibility

and dont be seen
gasps softly
breathing heavily

and sometime
in the next few days
the police will question you

coin ringing
ringing stops
i took him upstairs
we played our nightly
game of go
at some point
he knocked the board over
and joni came up
to check on us
um
i gave him pain medication
he pulled his shoulder
last week
um
and i left him
in his study
at midnight
i said goodbye
to walt

since his injury
ive been giving him
a 100 milligram iv push
of toradol
its a nonnarcotic analgesic
and to help him sleep
three milligrams
of morphine
elliott and the family

marta detective
youre still here
benoit mmm
did you know harlan
benoit he knew my father
who was a police detective
years ago
oh
my father
respected harlan
that says quite a lot
is that why
youre here
here now here
chuckles no
i stayed hoping to speak
to you a little more
something is afoot
with this whole affair
i know it
i believe you know it too
so youre gonna keep digging
harlans detectives
they dig
they riffle and root
truffle pigs
i anticipate the terminus
of gravitys rainbow
gravitys rainbow
its a novel
yeah i know
i havent read it though
neither have i
nobody has
but i like the title
it describes
the path of a projectile
determined by natural law
et voila my method
i observe the facts
without biases
of the head or heart
i determine the arcs path
stroll leisurely
to its terminus
and the truth
falls at my feet
the medical examiner was ready
to rule this a suicide
but elliott agreed to keep it
pending for 48 hours
tomorrow morning
i search the grounds
and the house
begin my investigation
i want you to be
by my side for it
what
my confidante
my eyes and ears
hey wait wait
detective why me
i trust your kind heart
also youre the only one
who had nothing to gain
from harlans death
so how about it watson
marta hey detective
if you want my insight
into the family
none of them are murderers
thats my insight
and yet
be it cruel or comforting
this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth
thats what it does
always
tomorrow at 800
knock at door on tv
speaking spanish
tv continues indistinctly
harlan i know
ive missed something
theres gonna be something
i missed
marta harlan
but i know you can do this
marta no i cant
harlan
without losing your soul
you have to do
what you have to do
no
to beat this and win
harlan i cant

right now
gasps
breathing deeply
harlan i have to
get you help
harlan you do as i say

gasps
sobbing quietly
characters speaking
spanish on tv
whistles
mr proofroc fifty years ago

the rounds with a 94
and keep your ears open
now youve got
all this modern technology

joni okay people grieve

lets not
you know what
its funny youre here at all
why are you even bothering
thats what
im asking myself
whats that supposed to mean
he knows what its
supposed to mean
wait walt what
jacob was in that bathroom
the night of the party
chuckles oh
thats where you were all night
richard what the hell
were you doing
in the bathroom all night
nothing
swatting syrian refugees
no i was not
altright troll
liberal snowflake
i dont know what
any of that means
it means your sons
a little creep
walt oh
my sons a creep
joni guys just
walt he was
in the bathroom
yeah he was
in the bathroom
joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer
sighs
you know what richard
you wanna go

you better
watch out man
walt stop it right now
walt son of a bitch

donna let go

walt i have been waiting

linda stop it right now
donna i can handle myself
linda stop it

oh my god
chuckles
we gotta do this more often
hey
jacob
we know
where this is going
you were in the bathroom
next to harlans office
where he had the fight
with ransom
now you heard something
spill it
i just heard two things
indistinct chatter
harlan my will
my will
and then there was more yelling
and then i heard ransom say
im warning you
linda ransom
whats that mean
i think it means our father
finally came to his senses
and cut this worthless
little brat out of his will
so i guess youre gonna have
to sell the beemer
and give your notice
at the country club
and kick whatever
fashion drug youre on
because if you think
that after all the bridges
youve burned
after all the
shit you said
after everything that
you put this family through
for the last 10 years
that any of us
are gonna support you
that any of us
are gonna give you
like dad liked to say
a single red dime
youre nuts
inhales sharply
mouthing wow
son
father
sighs did harlan tell you
he was gonna cut you
out of the will
yep
smacks lips
well then hes done
what none of us were
strong enough to do
maybe this might finally
make you grow up
linda
this might be the best thing
that could
ever happen to you
thank you my mother
ladies and gentlemen
look this is not
gonna be easy for you
but itll be good
nothing good is ever easy
up your ass joni
youve had your teeth in this
familys tit for a long time
up your ass
oh very nice
matter of fact eat shit
joni oh my god ransom
what
ransom hows that
please do not
use that word
in front of my son
in fact eat shit eat shit
joni if i wasnt practicing
ransom eat shit
you entitled prick
i would slap that
smug smile right off
definitely eat shit
of your goddamn face
ransom eat shit
you can all eat shit
all clamoring
walt im not eating
one iota of shit
marta what was that about
will readings being boring
benoit the exception
that proves the rule
door opens
sighs asshole
im warning you
ransom said
im warning you
well you heard
ransom in there
thats the kind of
thing he says
you want this
you want this
dog barks
what do we have here
this looks like
a relatively fresh break
yep right there
wait a minute
well that doesnt make sense
wheres that window
how about some
more cookies hugh
you want some more cookies
thats great thats great
walt
hey maybe harlan left you
a cold glass of milk
in his will asshole
show me
but stay off the carpet
thrombeys continue arguing
wagner its the trick window
from a kill for all seasons
benoit trooper here will you
take this
hmm
traces of dried mud
i suspect they go
the length of the hallway
footprints
benoit no just traces
yeah depending on when
this thing was last cleaned
this could have happened
at any time right
no that would
not explain this
analyze that mud
it will match
these traces
take this to jamie
benoit and you will find
similar samples
leading up the trellis
on the outside of the house
on the night of the party
somebody who did not want to
be heard climbing those steps
went to a great deal of trouble
to break into
harlan thrombeys rooms
the game is afoot
eh watson
alan well thank you all for
getting together like this
it isnt legally necessary
but i thought because
youre all in town
and some of you
are leaving soon
excuse me
uh im sorry
ladies and gentlemen
i would like to gently request
that you all stay in town
until the investigation
is completed
elliott yeah well
hes gently requesting
but im gonna have
to make that an order
no one move until we
figure this all out
what
can we ask why
has something changed
no
no it hasnt changed
or no we cant ask
benoit mr stevens
you may continue
alan right well
the other reason i thought
this gathering
would be uh beneficial
is because
harlan altered his will
a week before he died
he sealed it
he asked me not to
submit it to the courts
for probate
until after his death
so if anyone is confused
about anything
were all together
we can talk
although i dont imagine
any of it
is going to be
that complicated
uh harlans
assets included
um
the house
the house
which he owned outright
um
60 million
yes 60 million
in various cash accounts
and investments
and of course
the real asset
sole ownership
of blood like wine
his publishing company
he also wrote up a statement
when he was making the changes
and he wanted
that read first
dearest linda
walter and joni
some of you may be surprised
by the choice ive made here
no pleasure was taken
in the exclusion
and its purpose
was not to sow
greater discord in the family
quite the opposite
please accept it with grace
and without bitterness
but do accept it
its for the best dad
um
wow well yeah
not too complex at all
this will be quick
chuckles
i harlan thrombey
being of sound mind and body
and yadayadayada
i hereby direct
that all my assets
both liquid and otherwise
i leave in their entirety
to marta cabrera
my entire ownership
of blood like wine publishing
i leave in its entirety
to marta cabrera
the copyright
of its catalogue likewise
i leave in its entirety
to marta cabrera
linda what
walt uh
joni what
no
thats not thats no
linda no
that cant be
linda no
walt can i see that
please alan

what does he
mean by that
richard why didnt
you stop her
richard
what am i supposed to do
grab the bumper with my teeth
laughs
okay seriously though
what the hell
ransom hey
ill take an extra bowl
waitress sure
soft music playing
you look like
youre gonna pass out
have you eaten
anything today
eat
marta this is a nightmare
mmmhmm
so why
why
why
hey this is everything
theres gotta be a bigger reason
why and you know it
well how about
it had to do more
with you guys
than with me
yeah
yeah its the only thing
that makes sense
did he tell you anything
only that i wasnt
getting a cent
thats because
he wanted you
to build something from
the ground up like your mom
to build something
from the ground up
yeah my mother built her
business from the ground up
with a milliondollar loan
from my grandfather
my father owns none of it
she made him sign a prenup
he lives in fear
and i know thats what
my grandfather was trying
to protect me from
by doing this
and i know i shouldnt say
this out loud
but when he told me i
jesus
i coulda killed him
after i left the party though
i was driving
nowhere just in the night
and i had this um
clarity
like from here on out
i was gonna have to
fend for myself
and that felt
good
the old bastard
sighs
marta i know
three things
one
i know he didnt
commit suicide
what makes you think that
i dont think it
i know it
because i knew my granddad
maybe you and i were
the only two who knew him
so youre not gonna bullshit me
on this because two
i know lying makes you puke
cause of that mafia game
last fourth of july
clicks tongue and three
i know you just ate
a full plate of baked beans
and sausage
so
look me in the eye
and tell me what happened
to my grandfather
you asshole
marta
tell me everything
sighs
walt alan there have got
to be options here
alan no
i dont know
how many times
i can repeat the same
two pieces of information
if harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes
and we all
confirmed that he was
would a sound mind do this
how sound how
the very action
speaks to unsoundness
not legally no
you not liking what he did
does not speak
to testamentary capacity
what about
undue influence
yeah undue influence
how about that huh
did you just google that
look if marta was
manipulating dad somehow
and if we found out
if somehow she had gotten
that somehow she was
her hooks into him
you need a strong
case for that
your honor
she endeared herself to him
through hard work
and good humor
that wont cut the salami
joni what about
the slayer rule
i did just google that
the slayer rule obviously
doesnt apply here
well what the hell
is the slayer rule
well its if
someone is convicted
of killing the person
they dont get
their inheritance
not even convicted
even if theyre
held responsible
for their death
in civil court
like oj
yes like oj
but harlan committed suicide
joni detective blanc
you said
the investigation is ongoing
you made a point of that
do you suspect foul play
mr blanc

this blanc guy thinks he is

loud knock on door
gasps
marta get your ass up
what the hell
is happening
theres a guy here
and a bunch of stuff
everythings going crazy

maybe alice
i dont know
alice i dont even know
what that means
but you better get
your ass up okay
speaks spanish
we dont know much
about marta cabrera
or her exact relationship
oh my god
with harlan thrombey
marta what is all this
beyond being his home nurse
what did you do
is that here
oh yeah it is
indistinct chatter outside
wait so is that true
are we rich
newscaster this is
a story so compelling
oh my god
you would think he had
written the story himself
opera music playing
footsteps approaching
benoit good morning
mrs thrombey
why is grief
the providence of youth
i dont know
but id imagine that age
deepens all feelings
including grief
this was a long walk
to offering condolences
for the loss of your son
and asking you
if it isnt presumptuous of me
not to think too harshly
of your family
if i am as i suspect
the first to console you
theyre young arent they
one thing i assume of age
is weariness
damned if i dont get
more tired every day
tired of what i do
following arcs
like lobbed rocks
the inevitability of truth
but the complexity and the gray
lie not in the truth
but what you do with the truth
once you have it
i think you have something
you wanna tell me
i think youre
very perceptive
and very capable of
telling me what you saw
the night
of your sons party
but ill happily wait
im in no rush
in fact
i find it quiet pleasant
sitting here with you
opera music continues
lawyers were here
very big lawyers
it looked like
they left all this stuff
and business cards
and there was
a pile of other stuff
when i got home
speaking spanish
in english i dont like
any of this marta
speaks spanish
in english
i dont like it either
im slipping out the back
ill be back later
please dont talk to anyone
speaks spanish
walt
yeah i came uh
hey how you doin
chuckles
walt i want you to know
that i didnt know
about any of this
we know you didnt
this is
we know you didnt
yeah we all kind of went
a little crazy yesterday
understandable
yeah
i havent even
looked at all this yet
walt it must just be
local lawyers and accountants
who saw the news
and wanna get a jump on it
yeah id be careful
of all of it
marta is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance
this is what harlan wanted
sighs
yeah but
harlan put you in a very hard
position here i mean
it was unfair of him
i mean you see
the kind of press and scrutiny
that this kicks up
and we know
with your mother
my mother
yeah
what did meg tell you
oh this isnt about
chuckles
youre missing the point
we dont wanna
attack you with this
but marta if your mother
came into the
country illegally
criminally
and youve come
into this inheritance
with all the scrutiny
that entails
id be afraid
that could come to light
and thats what
we wanna avoid here
we can protect you
from that happening
or if it happens
so youre saying that
even if it came to light
with your familys resources
you could help me fix it
yeah
yeah with the right
lawyers you know
not these local guys
but new york lawyers
dc lawyers
with enough resources
put toward it yes
not that that ever even
needs to come up
but yes
okay good
okay
because harlan gave me
all your resources
so that means
with my resources
ill be able to fix it
so i guess
i will find the right lawyers
uh marta thats
you better be sure thats
what you want
cell phone buzzing
birds chirping
ransom i dont know
whats this
marta its my
medical bag tag
they have my medical bag
for some reason
okay but this is a photocopy
of just the header
of a blood toxicology report
on harlan
marta this is gonna show
the morphine overdose
breathing heavily
so im screwed
how do you know all this stuff
i was harlans research
assistant for a summer
but what kind of
blackmail scheme is this
i mean the actual evidence
is sitting up the street
at the crime lab
theres no demands
theres no meeting place
whats the point
in sending you this
siren wailing
fire chief it could be
a half hour
it could be an hour
it depends
we wanna make sure
whistles
fire chief
so it could take a while
benoit whats the cheese
but ill let you know
elliott oh hey
fire chief yeah
elliott thank you chief
fire chief no problem
500 am
security systems
here are all triggered
now this thing
went up really quick
so that means
blood stores records
anything of that nature
its all gone
there were no
employees here
so thank god for that
mmmhmm
what about security cameras
oh yeah
speaking of security
the surveillance tape
at the thrombey estate
was all scrambled
for some reason
yeah
whats still pending
from the autopsy
just a report
on the blood work
blood work
marta holy shit
this is insane
i mean who would blow up
a whole real building
just to blackmail me
marta this means
the blackmailer
has the only paper copy
of the thing that
can prove your guilt
you didnt get
any other instructions
no phone call
no email nothing
no
well i havent
checked my email
there is one
ransom yeah thats it
1209 columbus road 10 am

indistinct radio chatter
oh my god

car chase of all time

i spoke to wanetta thrombey
greatnana
night of the party
she saw someone
climbing the trellis
to the third floor
mr drysdale come on
wagner lets go
elliott pat him down

marta whats going on
benoit ransom came back
she said
wagner hands on the vehicle
i dont know
what he came back to do
but well find out
wagner you got anything sharp

hey you dont need
to thank him
did he ask you to drive
when he saw me coming
yes
stomach gurgles
gags retches
elliott
blanc coming with us
benoit ill drive with marta
lets go to the
police station
i want a full rundown
on everything he said to you
ill catch you up
on where were at
strange case from the start
a case with a hole
in the middle
a donut
im just talking
through my process here
let me know
if this is boring
i feel the noose tightening
the family is
truly desperate
desperate motives
the mystery of who hired me
the impossibility of the crime
and yet
a donut
one central piece
and if it reveals itself
the fog would lift
the arc would resolve
the slinky become unkinked
do you mind
if i stop for a second
i need to pick something up
itll be very quick
sure
itll be just a few minutes
watch the uh
door
indistinct chatter
marta hello
water dripping
listen i dont know
what you want
whatever it is
we can work it out
but we have to figure it out
right here right now
and im leaving
with that report
hello
gasps
fran
wheezing
gasps
no no no no fran
stifled gasping
oh my god fran
can you hear me
fran give me a sign

jesus stop it
stifled groaning
line ringing
fran gasps softly
gasping stops
dispatcher 911
whats your emergency
the thought of you
stays bright
siren wailing
sometimes i stand
in the middle of the floor
not going left
not going
oh lord
indistinct announcement
over pa
benoit all right my friend
thank you for the update
no need for that
ill bring her in
once we get word
that the housekeeper
is stable
its still
touch and go
all right
listen this is over
people are getting hurt
so im gonna
tell you the truth
young ransom just told
lieutenant elliott everything
good
wait i hope he
didnt cover for me
did he tell you
the real truth
about me switching the
sighs yeah
and the disguise bit
yes
and the whole blackmail and
mmmhmm
but why did fran
take my morphine
i mean obviously she had
swiped the bag from the house
but she didnt seem like
a user to me
unless thats why she needed
the blackmail money
i dont know
it doesnt matter anyway
i have to tell the
thrombeys myself
i feel like i owe that to them
i dont think
thats a good idea
no i have to do it
i need to do it
i gave the doctors
my number
so theyll call if anything
changes with fran
all right
ill round up the thrombeys
at the house
along with a police escort
for the arrest after
you can tell me your whole
story on the drive over
i dont want
any more surprises
marta fran said
it was stashed
the copy and then she said
you did this
you wont get away with it
and i called the ambulance
thats it
all right
you ready
sighs softly
richard oh
okay
well has she
come to her senses
well shes standing
right there richard
she can speak for herself
is the rest
of the family here
walt in the living room
i think that it
would be better
if we were to gather again
and get this over with
hey
hey
im so sorry i told
them about your mom
meg its okay
im sorry no
i was scared i just
i didnt wanna tell them
i get it
trust me
i understand
its all right
sniffles im sorry
sighs chuckles
god i am so raiding
frans stash after this
benoit i still think
this is a bad idea
but the family is assembled
i know where
the tox report is
she basically told me
where it was
anyways this will
tie everything up
and i just
handed it to you
god youre not much
of a detective are you
well to be fair
you make
a pretty lousy murderer
perhaps we
deserve each other
youve always
been good to me
and what im about to say
isnt gonna be easy
and youre gonna
be upset
but i thought after
what youve gone through
the last few days
that you deserved
to hear it from me
hmm
i
excuse me
you have not been good to her
you have all
treated her like shit
to steal back a fortune
that you lost
and she deserves
youre a pack of vultures
at the feast
knives out beaks bloody
well inhales sharply
youre not getting bailed
out not this time
ms cabrera has
decided definitively
not to renounce
the inheritance
what
what
furthermore it will be
my professional recommendation
to the local authorities
that the manner of death
in the case of harlan thrombey
is ruled as suicide
and the case is closed
blanc
what
thank you all for coming
goodbye
whats going on
just tell me
thats certainly not
what i was expecting
donna no
dog growls
richard
is anybody else confused
walt not what i was expecting
to hear at all
chuckles
are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on
yes yes
i just wanna come clean okay
its over
almost
blanc what are we doing
whats going on
im sorry officer wagner
keep the family
out of this room
and get em out of
the house if you can
but stand by
with your additional officer
get the family out
yes but not all of them
would you whispers
thank you
elliott blanc
wagner yes sir
come on come on
whats all this drama
indulge me
marta blanc
i told ransom ransom told you
and im telling you now
it is an immovable fact
that i killed harlan
yes you did yes he did
yes you are
but but i spoke in the car
about the hole
at the center of this donut
and what you and harlan did
that fateful night
seems at first glance
to fill that hole perfectly
a donut hole in a donuts hole
but we must
look a little closer
and when we do
we see the donut hole
has a hole in its center
it is not a donut hole
but a smaller donut
with its own hole
and our donut
is not whole at all
blanc look i understand that
this is amusing for you
why was i hired
why would someone hire me
elliott someone fishing
for a crime
to reverse the will blanc
come on
but i was hired before
the sealed will was read
so yes
the person must have known
the contents of the will
but one step further
that same person must have
known a crime was committed
and further
if the intent was to reverse
martas inheritance
they must have known
that marta was responsible
an intriguing combination
of factors
someone who knew
what marta did
wanted to expose it
but could not reveal
how they knew
fran
she was blackmailing me
she knew what i did
yeah but fran wanted money
ergo she did not want
the crime exposed
what if someone
in the family had observed
marta doing
something suspicious
but they would have had
no reason not to speak up
sighs
the answer
is not so simple
now with the entire solution
in my field of view
the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors
sighs marta it will not
be easy for you to hear
but there is at least
one truly guilty party
behind it all
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice
and committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent
trooper wagner
trooper wagner
no
marta im so sorry
i told them everything
i figured it was up
im sorry
hey its all right ransom
im glad you did
not exactly
everything though
marta is this about
what greatnana told you
she saw me that night
she mistook me for ransom
well get to that
in the meanwhile
mr hugh ransom drysdale
you might tell us all
why you hired me
why i hired you
youre right
lets back it up
to the night of the party
your argument with harlan
what were the overheard words
by the nazi child
masturbating in the bathroom
my will and
im warning you
you and harlan
were drama mamas
you shared a love of twisting
the knife into one another
you see i dont believe
he would have
slipped it in halfway
no no no
i submit
harlan told you everything
you cant be serious
not a red dime
or word of my work
to a single one of them
you included
marta
remind me what ransom said
his conversation
with harlan ended with
harlan told him that
i could beat him at go
benoit and i asked myself
marta
why would the topic of the will
have steered around
to marta
there is one
obvious explanation
you cant be that crazy
youre not just gonna
throw away your fortune
no im giving it to marta
all of it
scoffs
your brazilian nurse
are you goddamn insane
im sane for the first time
in my life
and ive done it
harlan if you think
im gonna let this happen
if you think im gonna
stand here and
ive made the change
to my will its done
im warning you
thats some
heavyduty conjecture
granted
but it is the only way
what comes next makes sense
so you storm out
you drive off into the night
you tell marta later
what was it
feeling an overwhelming sense of
clarity
that he had to make do
for himself from here on out
exactly
brakes screech
marta the will harlan
do for yourself
you wont get away with this
and a plan forms
you return
careful to avoid the gates
security camera range
then on foot up
towards the house
you sneak in up the trellis
so as not to be seen
by the rest of the family
who are still having
their party downstairs
what you need to do
will take moments
but it is essential that you
are alone and undetected
you knew what
medications harlan took
you knew what marta would be
injecting him with that night
and you knew
if marta was responsible
for his death
even unintentionally
the slayer rule would nullify
the changed will
and you would
get your share back
you used
the syringes in the kit
to switch the liquids
in the two medication vials
and as a final precaution
you took the naloxone
the lifesaving antidote
marta no no no no
thats impossible
benoit that is the truth
hand me that vial of morphine
ill show you
if he did that
if the meds were switched
then when i got them
mixed up i
i accidentally
switched them back
so i gave harlan
benoit the correct doses
yes
but not accidentally
i taped over the label
of these two vials
the vials themselves
are identical
howd you know
this was the morphine
i just knew
you knew because
there is the slightest
almost imperceptible
differences
of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids
you knew because youve
done it a hundred times
you gave him
the correct medication
because you are a good nurse
then harlan was
im sorry marta but yes
harlan was perfectly fine
oh my god
his blood was normal
the cause of death was truly
solely suicide
and you are guilty
of nothing but some damage
to the trellis
and a few amateur theatrics
sighs
in fact
if harlan had listened to you
and called the ambulance
he would be alive today
damn
benoit a twisted web
and we are not finished
untangling it
not yet
marta when greatnana
spotted you
climbing down
the trellis she said
ransom
are you back again already
benoit are you back
again already
cause earlier that night
panting
ransom youre back
scoffs come on marta
this is stoopid with two os
you dont have
a shred of evidence
youre just
spinning a fairy tale
not a shred no
just as we have no real proof
of marta mixing up the vials
so its your word
you have her confession
all right yeah
yeah we do have that
with your permission
id like to spin
a little further
much later that night
youd have to come back
to the house
to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials
however this time
the dogs were outside
dogs barking
benoit they barked
waking meg
no matter
youll get the vials tomorrow
but tomorrow brings news
not of a medical error
and a guilty nurse
but of a slit throat
and a suicide
now the circumstances
are perfect
for the anonymous hirin of me
you know a crime has been
committed by miss cabrera
you need her
to be caught for it
you cannot reveal
how you know
enter
benoit blanc
benny look
i hear what youre saying
but this
shushing
the body is discovered early
the next morning
the police
the medical examiner
the family
everyone swarms in
and there is no possible way
you can get to
martas medical bag
to retrieve the vials
you must wait
for your moment
when the investigation
is over
and you know
the house will be empty
and that is why
you missed the funeral
there is no one home to wonder
why youre going
into harlans study
or so you think
zipper opening
poor fran
she witnessed you tampering
with harlans medication
in the medical bag
she did not know
what you were doing
but she knew
you were up to no good
so her mind begins to turn
marta oh god
that hallmark movie
she told me about
with danica mckellar
deadly by surprise
marta thats what
she was talking about
benoit she loved harlan
she hates ransom
so the poor girl decides
to test her theory
and make this asshole pay
she gets a copy
of the toxicology report
now i will be honest
i have no idea how
cause she has a cousin
she told me
she has a cousin
who works as a receptionist
at the examiners office
well voila
the numbers
they mean nothing to her
but if ransom is guilty
its existence is a threat
so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note
so why did she send it to me
she didnt
she sent it to ransom
and when mr drysdale gets it
what is his reaction
elation
he still thinks marta
has given harlan
the tampered drugs
a blood tox report
will prove her guilt
he goes to the will reading
in high spirits
ready to see the family
tear itself apart
secure in the knowledge
it will be all undone
when the tox report
comes to light
and then
inaudible
benoit martas confession
and everything
turns on its head
he now realizes that marta
has committed no crime
and the tox report
will prove her innocence
the changed will
is gonna stand
he has lost
scoffs
unless
unless you decide
youre not gonna give up
the money
youre not gonna give up
the money
youve come this far
youve come this far
just one step further
just one last act
in for a penny in for a pound
you decide you are in
glass shattering
benoit step one
fire roaring
destroy all evidence
of martas innocence
shattering
step two
send her the anonymous email
with a late morning
rendezvous time
and deliver her
the blackmail note
step three
keep your
appointment with fran
fran oh i knew it
i knew you were a nogood
son of a bitch
i knew harlan wouldnt
just kill himself
ransom yes fran
you were right
fran i knew you were
guilty as shit
and now
youre gonna pay for it
dont you come near me
dont come near me
im warning you
muffled screaming
benoit see now
now the board is set
marta will get
the blackmail note
youll put the pieces
together for her
youll guide her
to the rendezvous
youll make the anonymous call
to the police
they will catch her there
with the body
and the burned evidence
marta will get arrested
for killing fran
and harlan
she said
you did this
she didnt say
you did this
she wasnt talking about me
she said
hugh did this
hugh did this
cause you made the help
call you hugh
cause youre an asshole
and it would have worked
if we hadnt have brought you
in for questioning
so you could not make
your anonymous call
and if fran had not stashed
a safety copy of the tox report
and if marta had not
outplayed you once again
by having a kind heart
by saving frans life
though it meant
her losing the inheritance
and going to jail
she didnt play your game
she saved frans life
frans alive
oh yes
fran
cell phone buzzing
who will confirm
this very story
or something close to it
and send you hugh
to jail
cell phone buzzing
yes
doctor thats great news
well be there soon
thank you
shes okay
shes ready to talk
benoit trooper wagner
if you could uh
keep mr drysdale in custody
while lieutenant elliott
ms cabrera and myself
we go to the hospital
and take frans statement
all right
up come on
scoffs
im gonna say this
just to you
no cameras no courtroom
just you
cause you know its true
we allowed you
into our home
we let you watch
our granddad
we welcomed you
into our family
and now you think
you can steal it from us
you think im not gonna fight
to protect my home
our birthright
our ancestral family home
laughing loudly
that is hooey
harlan he bought
this place in the 80s
from a pakistani
real estate billionaire
oh shut up blanc
