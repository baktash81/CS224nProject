it s my company 
right  right  sorry 
i built my business
from the ground up 
oh  just like your father 
you two were very close 
we    we had our own secret
way of communicating 
i mean  you had to
find that with dad 
you had to find a game
to play with him 
and if you did that 
and you played by his rules   
everyone idolizes
their dad  right 
i don t know 
do they 
very much not 
don t know why
i said that 
but my wife  linda  does 
harlan started out
with a rusty smith corona
and built himself into
one of the best selling
mystery writers of all time 
wow  seems like all his kids
are self made overachievers 
 sighs  sure 
elliott  for the record 
i m speaking with walt thrombey 
harlan thrombey s
youngest son 
so  you run your father s
publishing company 
yeah  it s my   
it s our   
uh  it s the family s
publishing company 
dad trusts me to run it 
thirty languages 
over 80 million copies sold 
a real legacy 
  elliott  mmm hmm 
  you guys fans 
i mean  i don t do much
fiction reading myself  but   
big fan 
i m a big fan 
i mean

spoil it for you but   
okay  like
thousand knives 
the cow
and the shotgun 
like  where do you
come up with that 
well  dad said
the plots just
popped into his head 
fully formed 
it was the easy part for him 
 plays note on piano 
elliott  um  so you re
in the area  right 
uh  you guys probably
arrived around the same time 
uh   
we all got here
around 8 00 
my wife  donna  she s my rock 
   fork clatters 
   shrieks 
jesus  donna 
are you all right 
walt  my son  jacob  he s 16 
very politically active 
the boy is
literally a nazi 
he s an alt right
troll dipshit 
kids today with the
internet  it s amazing 
elliott   chuckles 
so the night went well 
walt  i mean 
we re all gutted  but  uh 
i was happy to have
that night with him 
to be by his side 
to think about our books
and what we ve accomplished
with them 
it s like i can still feel
his hand on my shoulder 
passing the torch 
elliott  so  we re here
with joni thrombey 
harlan thrombey s
daughter in law 
mmm hmm 
yeah  i married his son  neil 
we had one daughter  meg 
and then neil passed on
15 years ago 
but you remained close
to the thrombeys 
oh  they re my family 
 upbeat music playing 
joni  i feel
simultaneously freed by
and supported by them 
 indistinct chatter 
it s that balance of opposites
that s the nugget of flam 
sorry  the nugget of   
flam 
 chuckles  oh  yeah  flam 
your skincare company  sorry 
i forgive you 
yeah  it s skincare 
but it promotes a total
lifestyle 
self sufficiency with
an acknowledgement
of human need 
that s flam 
but it s also harlan 
he got me and meg
through some tough times 
grandad gives my mom
a yearly allowance
and he s never missed wiring
a tuition payment
to my schools 
he s a genuinely
selfless man 
but you left
the party early 
meg  have fun 
to see some friends at smith 
you know dad pays for her
crypto marxist post 
deconstructural 
feminist poetry theory 
whatever major 
she could have stuck
around for the cake 
joni  i think linda was upset 
hmm 
but harlan understood 
 plays note on piano 
right 
um  you two showed up to the
party around the same time   
if i could pause 
because i just   
who is that guy 
and why are we doing
all this again   chuckles 
elliott  this is just some
follow up questions 
um  we re attempting
to be thorough 
so we can figure out
the manner of death 
so by  manner of death  
you mean if
someone killed him 
 stutters 
if one of us killed him 
  one of his family killed him 
  no  no  walt  walt  no  no   
is that what you re
suggesting  lieutenant 
no one s
saying that  okay 
this is all
pro forma 
okay 
so who the fuck is that 
um   
this is
benoit blanc 
   chuckles  benoit blanc 
  elliott  yes 
mr  blanc is
a private investigator
of great renown 
joni  wait a minute 
i read a tweet about a
new yorker article about you 
 the last
of the gentlemen sleuths  
you solved that case
with the tennis champ 
 chuckles  you re famous 
elliott  mr  blanc is not
with the police department
and not officially involved
in the case 
but he s offered to consult 
now  i happily obliged 
and i can vouch for him 
mr  blanc 
i know who you are 
i read your profile
in the new yorker 
i found it delightful 
i just buried
my 85 year old father
who committed suicide 
why are you here 
 clicks tongue  i m here
at the behest of a client 
who 
i cannot say 
but let me assure you this 
my presence
will be ornamental 
you will find me a respectful 
quiet  passive observer
of the truth 
fine 
are we getting there 
nearly  um   
harlan s nurse 
she was at the party
in a professional capacity 
marta 
i guess 
harlan hired her
to be around to take care
of whatever medical needs
popped up 
but really 
she s like part of the family 
good kid 
been a good friend to harlan 
family s from paraguay 
linda really likes
her work ethic 
 immigrants 
we get the job done  
   stutters  i   
  from hamilton 
  wagner  oh  hamilton 
   laughs 
it s so good 
it s so good 
  i saw it at the public 
  wagner  oh 
 stutters 
may i just  um   
then i ll recede  but   
as a self made
man myself 
i have to express
my admiration
for how you followed
in your father s footsteps 
  thank you 
  benoit  just marvelous 
you know 
the whole family  too 
and joni with her thing 
and walt with his
publishing empire   
 stutters  it s   
well   
yes  i mean  walt 
he s done well
with what dad gave him 
not that it matters 
but really  dad hands him
a book twice a year
and walt publishes it 
it s just not the same 
but surely walt runs the
merchandising  adaptations 
film and television rights 
i mean   
are you baiting me  detective 
 stutters 
you know he doesn t 
and if you think
i am dumb enough
to be baited into
talking family business 
into shit talking
my baby brother 
in front of
a police detective 
and a state trooper   
walt doesn t run shit 
because there are no tv
and film rights 
harlan never allowed
any adaptations of his books 
hated the idea 
no 
yeah 
drives walt nuts 
 cause that s where
the real money is 
when walt would get
a little irish courage in him 
  he d get into it with harlan 
  the window is   
did he  get into it 
at the party 
oh  my god 
come on  dad 
richard  wouldn t leave
him alone  the poor guy 
harlan finally had
to give him the hook 
walt  the netflix guys 
their business affair guy   
richard  i didn t hear
what he said 
but he must ve really
handed him his lunch 
 cause walt was like a wounded
puppy the rest of the night 
what  richard said what 
no  jesus 
we did not get  into it  
i m just trying to get
an accurate impression 
harlan took you aside
at the party 
when you returned 
you were chastened 
what did harlan say to you 
the netflix guys 
their business affair guy 
he sent something over 
it s hard numbers this time 
and i just think
this is a window
that s not
gonna stay open 
we need to take
advantage of it
and then you just need
to look at the numbers 
  yeah  walt  look   
  dad  dad 
you    you put me
in charge of our books 
let me be in charge 
let me do this  please 
they re not
our books  son 
they re my books 
and this is not how i wanted
to have this conversation 
but you re right 
you re right 
it s unfair of me
to keep you tethered
to something that
isn t yours to control 
what 
no  i ve done you
a grave disservice 
all these years 
i ve kept you
from building something
of your own
that was yours 
but you re not
going to be running
the publishing house
anymore 
you re free of it 
whoa   
dad  are you
firing me 
no     chuckles 
we ll talk
details tomorrow 
my mind s made up 
good boy 
we talked  we had a business
discussion about e books 
jesus  it was nothing 
you want to talk
about an argument 
hell  ransom had
an argument with him 
ransom  that s  uh 
  richard and linda s son 
  walt  mmm 
look  we all love ransom 
he s a good kid  we love him 
but 
but he s always been
the black sheep of the family 
ah 
 stutters 
and i m not trying to   
i like to keep stuff like this
in the family 
but with ransom 
he s never had a job 
and dad 
for some unknown reason 
always supported him 
they have this love hate bond 
they fight 
but that night  god 
they had a blowout 
about what 
ransom 
are you goddamn insane 
walt  we couldn t
make it out really 
but it was huge 
and it s strange they went
into another room to do it 
usually they like
to stoke up drama
in front of the whole family 
speaking of getting into it   
 chuckles 
you were at the house early 
to help the caterers set up  did   
did you converse with harlan
at that time 
well  he was there 
we must have spoke 
in his study 
i don t think so 
you see  i spoke
with the caterer this morning 
she didn t see you
helping her staff 
she did hear harlan
in a screaming match
with somebody that afternoon
in his study 
yeah  i don t   
  screaming match 
  mmm hmm 
no 
um     clicks tongue 
but joni was here  too 
um  she was early 
so it might have been her 
you can maybe ask her 
these were two male voices 
harlan shouted the phrase   
harlan 
you tell her or i will 
 you tell her
 or i will  
bells ringing 
that s none
of your business 
you stay out
of my marriage 
i know my daughter 
and she would want to know 
i ve put all of it
in this letter to her 
tomorrow  she gets it 
harlan  i m warning you 
  no  she deserves to know 
  you stay out of my marriage 
she deserves to know 
and you re gonna tell her 
  the hell i am 
  you tell her or i will 
yes  i know 
yes 
 chuckles  uh   
harlan had finally decided to
put his mom in a nursing home
and linda had
always opposed that 
and i wanted to wait
until we got back
to boston  uh  to tell linda 
so  to avoid a whole scene 
and harlan wanted me
to tell her then 
that was it 
 inhales sharply 
sorry  forgot 
the house 
uh  early 
richard said you were there 
i was at the house early 
benoit  to see harlan 
to see harlan 
yes 
what were you
seeing harlan about 
it was just a mix up
with the  uh 
the payment for meg s tuition 
i m    i m   
i m sorry to press 
but what kind of mix up 
yeah  the school hasn t
got the check yet 
i don t know why alan
didn t mail it 
harlan  well 
alan didn t mail it
because he caught
a discrepancy 
alan s office has been wiring
tuition directly to the school
as per your request 
but phyllis s office that
handles your yearly allowance
has been wiring tuition monies
directly to you as well 
you have been double dipping
meg s tuition
and stealing from me 
   scoffs 
   100 000 a year 
for the past four years 
harlan  i don t know
how this mix up happened 
but i swear to god   
harlan  so  now i am writing
this tuition check 
but you must know
that this is the last money
you or meg will get from me 
please 
you don t understand   
joni  i know it ll hurt 
but it s all for the best 
my mind s made up 
it was  uh 
a money wiring issue
with the office at the school 
so i had to ask harlan to cut
a check for the semester 
mmm  no big deal 
well   
why don t we 
uh  just take
a little break
and we ll resu   
oh  no   
she s gone 
 exhales deeply 
linda  richard 
joni  have you
seen richard 
no  i was  uh 
just done with the  um   
okay  thanks 
no 
linda  damn it  richard 
richard 
 chuckles 
son of a bitch 
see  i might be a victim
of my own expectation here 
but when
the great benoit blanc
comes knocking
at my door 
i expect it s going
to be about something 
if not extraordinary 
then at least interesting 
but    i m sorry 
this is an open and shut
case of suicide
and  uh  quite frankly  benny 
we re getting to the point
where i need to know
what we re doing here 
benoit  the method 
throat slit 
typical for
a suicide 
yes  i mean 
that s dramatic 
but look around 
i mean  the guy practically
lives in a clue board 
elliott  come on  benny 
talk to me  all right 
now  you tell me to invite
all of these people back
for questioning
all over again  i get it 
wagner  listen 
i ve had boots on the ground
in this county
for a while now 
people are generally
what they seem to be 
you re not gonna find
murderers in this family 
elliott 
this is a pleasant family
with the usual quarrels 
but no possible motives
for murder 
where are you going 
 gasps 
harlan thrombey s nurse 
marta   
  cabrera 
  marta cabrera  please 
miss cabrera 
you can just wait inside
  and we ll be with you in   
  benoit  miss cabrera 
i ve been doin 
a little pokin  
you were hired
on a part time basis
as a registered
nurse  yes 
uh  yes  i don t work for a vna 
harlan hired
me directly 
take a seat  please 
and you re paid
a flat rate
for how many hours a week 
um   
well  i started at 15 
and then he   
he needed more help 
medical help 
he needed a friend 
does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse 
elliott  all right  blanc 
i mean  this is   
yeah  yeah  marta 
we were just discussing
possible motives
in the family 
i suspect that
harlan has told you
much unfiltered truth
about each of  em 
and a little bird
has told me 
how shall i
put this delicately   
you have
a regurgitative reaction
to mistruthin  
 chuckles 
who told you that 
is it true 
uh   
  yes 
  oh 
it s something
i ve had since i was a kid 
it s a physical thing
that i     shudders 
just the thought of lying   
yeah  it makes me puke 
benoit  really 
 both chuckle 
 thunder rumbling 
is richard havin  an affair 
 sighs 
why do men instinctively
pull at loose threads
on their parachutes 
what 
richard 
mmm hmm 
  an affair 
  yeah 
a yes or no will do 
mmm    no 
 clicks tongue 
 scoffs 
   stomach gurgles 
   gags 
  oh  shit 
   retches 
  wagner  oh  my god 
  dear girl  i m sorry 
  i assumed you were speaking figuratively 
  wagner  here  have some water 
  i have wet naps in the car 
  all right  here  here 
just take a
sip of this 
take that 
  that s quite somethin  
  hmm 
  thanks 
  but i was obviously right 
richard is having
an affair 
his father in law found
out and confronted him 
 you tell her
or i will  
okay  but even if
that were the case  he   
   marta gags 
  you all right 
yeah 
even if that were
the case  i mean 
protecting a relationship
as a motive 
that s weak sauce 
you know that 
well  then there
is joni 
  joni 
  joni 
lifestyle guru joni 
no  harlan was supporting
her and her daughter
and that s the
opposite of a motive 
and if that support
was threatened   
miss cabrera 
one moment  please 
yes  i just wanna
get some scope 
miss cabrera   
 door closes 
was harlan plannin  on
cutting off joni s allowance 
oh  joni 
what s up 
 stomach gurgles 
oh  my god 
all right  don t answer that
if you re gonna
puke again  please 
meg said he paid
the school directly 
joni said he sent
the money to her 
both were true 
she was pocketing
the double payment 
harlan found out 
and cut her off
without a cent 
yes 
wagner  so she bumps him off
for the inheritance 
come on  no 
have you seen her insta 
she s an influencer 
no  allowance
as a motive 
again  more weak sauce 
you re just dumpin  that vat
of weak sauce on me 
granted  but she
lied to me 
all three of them did 
elliott  three 
walter 
ah  i see where you re
going with this 
harlan had turned walter down
before regarding film rights 
but that night  somethin 
harlan said shook him 
now we look at the pattern 
harlan was cleanin  house 
no wonder 
did he plan to fire walter 
can i just wait inside 
i feel like
i shouldn t be here 
yeah  please 
just wait inside 
stay close  all right 
 door opens 
 door closes 
benoit  you have been
very patient  my friend 
and yes 
you are right 
none of these weak alibis
and domestic squibbles
answer your question   
 why is benoit blanc here  
well  now i will tell you why 
i m here because this mornin  
someone dodged
a very important question 
who 
me 
linda asked
who hired me 
well  who hired you 
i do not know 
an envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday
with a news clippin 
of thrombey s death 
an envelope 
that worked 
  an envelope of cash 
  hmm 
so somebody
suspects foul play
and goes through this
ha cha dance of hiring me 
of staying anonymous 
it makes no damn sense 
compels me  though 
walk me through
everyone s whereabouts
at the time of death 
we know that the party ended
around 11 30 
  harlan  good night  joni 
   night 
elliott 
marta took harlan upstairs
to give him his meds 
 stairs creaking 
the stairs leading
up to harlan s bedroom
and his attic office
creak horribly
and linda is a light sleeper 
so we know every time
someone took the stairs
that night 
 chanting in hindi 
elliott  the first was
when joni heard a ka thunk
from somewhere above her
in the house 
 loud thud 
 sighs 
she s concerned about harlan 
so she goes up
to investigate   
 stairs creaking 
waking linda 
harlan was in his attic office
with marta 
  hi  joni 
  i just    hi 
elliott  he explained that
they had just
knocked over the go board 
i just knocked over
the go board  so   
elliott  you know  that game
with the grid and stones 
they play it every night 
he was fine   go to bed  
go to bed  joni 
  love you   night 
  love you 
  elliott  so she did 
  bye 
elliott  ten minutes later 
linda is awoken
a second time   
 stairs creaking 
by marta leaving 
marta  walt  i m leaving 
walt was smokin  a cigar
on the porch with his son 
he saw her leave
and drive off 
noted the time 
midnight 
 car door opens and closes 
 engine starts 
fifteen minutes later 
linda is awoken for the third
and final time   
 stairs creaking 
by someone coming
down the stairs 
harlan  who came down
for a midnight snack 
walt  dad  go back to bed 
elliott  which walt tried
to discourage 
based on this 
the medical examiner
determined the time of death
to be between
12 15 and 2 00 a m 
as walt was
finishing his cigar
at about 12 30  meg came home 
she went straight to bed 
walt and jacob
turned in shortly after that 
   snoring 
   dogs barking 
and sometime later that night 
it s undetermined 
but possibly near 3 00 a m  
meg woke up because
the dogs were barking outside 
she used the bathroom 
went back to bed 
that s it  all right 
now  everyone s
stories matched 
every moment
accounted for 
and there is
no other staircase
up to harlan s room 
none  just the creaky one 
interesting 
wagner  so  uh  we know that
ransom didn t do it
because he
wasn t there 
marta couldn t have 
harlan was still alive
when she left 
  yeah 
  meg   
meg came home
during the window

impossible for anyone
to have been around him

own throat  all right

you know  sometimes i think
that everything i ve
given my family 
i ve done maybe
without knowing  or maybe
to keep them beneath me 
i certainly should have   
 sighs  i don t know 
encouraged walt
to write his own stories 
not just be
a caretaker of mine 
like you said i should 
and then be a father
and not just a provider
for joni  like you
also said 
and i could have been kinder
to linda and ransom   
 sighs 
jesus  ransom 
 chuckles 
oh  there s so much of me
in that kid 
confident  stupid 
i don t know  protected 
playing life like a game 
without consequence 
until you can t tell
the difference
between a stage prop
and a real knife 
you know  i don t
fear death 
but  oh  god 
i d like to fix some
of this before i go 
close the book
with a flourish

so what happens 
i m gonna give you
an emergency shot of naloxone 
so you don t die
in 10 minutes 
oh  well  no pressure 
 chuckles 
you know  this is
an interesting
and efficient
method of murder 
i need to write this down 
so  if someone switched
the meds on purpose 
i d be dead in 10 minutes 
  like stone cold dead 
  yes 
you ll feel symptoms in five 
sweats  disorientation 
and then   
yes  that big dose injected 
within 10  your   
your brain   
 breathing heavily 
yes  10 minutes 
from the moment of injection 
it s eight ish now 
and even if the victim called
for an ambulance
when he first
felt the symptoms
and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do 
the ambulance would take
at least 15 minutes to arrive
and it d be too late 
if the victim didn t have
the emergency naxostuff 
marta 
 crying 
  do you have the naxostuff 
  yes  i m gonna find it 
i have it because
it comes with the kit 
so it should be here

harlan  go downstairs
as noisily as you can
and then say goodbye loudly 
marta  walt  i m leaving 
harlan  call attention
to the time   
god  it s midnight already 
harlan  if you can 
drive out the gate 
then to avoid
the security cameras 
pull off the road before
the carved elephant 
marta  wait 
was it before or after 
harlan 
after the carved elephant 
marta  no  he said before 
was it 
harlan  beafterfore
the carved elephant 
marta  oh  shit 
harlan  park  and come back
on foot up to the house 
take the side yard pass
through the little gate 
the dogs will know you 
they shouldn t bark 
 dogs whimpering 
you ve got to get up
to the third floor
without being seen 
and the only way
is to climb the side trellis
and come in through
the trick hall window 
you gotta be kidding me 
harlan  i am not  do it 
 grunting 
and for god s sake 
don t make any noise 
 gasps 
 breathing heavily 
once you re inside 
now this is the tricky part   
marta 
this is the tricky part 
harlan  get my robe and cap
from my bedroom
and put them on 
marta  harlan   
this is crazy 
i don t think i can do that 
no  we need to make this
so airtight
that the average cop
will entirely dismiss you
as a suspect 
it sounds crazy 
but it ll work 
 exhales 
walt is smoking outside 
and he ll see you
through the glazed window 
walt  dad  go back to bed 
harlan  you were seen leaving 
the security cameras
show you driving off 
and 20 minutes later 
i m seen alive and well
by my son 
 chuckles  you see 
you ve gone from suspect
number one
to an impossibility 
leave the way you came
and don t be seen 
 gasps softly 
 breathing heavily 
ransom 
are you back
again already 
harlan  drive home 
and sometime
in the next few days
the police will question you 
no  no  no  no  no 
i can t lie 
you know i can t lie 
i ll puke 
well  then don t lie 
tell fragments of the truth 
in this exact order 
 coin ringing 
 ringing stops 
i took him upstairs 
we played our nightly
game of go 
at some point 
he knocked the board over
and joni came up
to check on us 
um   
i gave him pain medication 
he pulled his shoulder
last week 
um   
and i left him
in his study 
at midnight
i said goodbye
to walt 
went home 
what kind of medication
did you give him 
since his injury 
i ve been giving him
a 100 milligram iv push
of toradol 
it s a non narcotic analgesic 
and to help him sleep 
three milligrams
of morphine 
elliott  and the family
was aware of this 
marta  yes  of course 
elliott  did you notice
anything strange
or off about his demeanor 
no 
 stomach gurgles softly 
well  that sounds

 retching 
walt  hey  sis  people are
gonna start getting here
  for the memorial pretty soon 
   sniffles

like something he d write 
not do 
i keep waiting for
the big reveal 
 voice breaking 
where it ll make sense 
wouldn t that be nice 
oh  walt 
 sobbing 
fran  i don t think
he killed himself 
i don t  i really don t 
there s this
hallmark movie

with danica mckellar 
and in it  she plays
this wife
who s getting poisoned
by her husband 
but he s doing it
little by little 
so she doesn t know it
and she goes crazy 
and she kills herself 
and my cousin 
who s a receptionist
at the medical
examiner s office

joni  oh  god  yeah

donna  there are millions
of mexicans coming 
  oh  god  really

a race thing 
  yeah  this is not about race

  i mean  these are camps 
  yes 
richard  come on  joni

who was a police detective
years ago

here now  here 
 chuckles  no 
i stayed hoping to speak
to you a little more 
something is afoot
with this whole affair 
i know it 
i believe you know it  too 
so you re gonna keep digging 
harlan s detectives 
they dig 
they riffle and root 
truffle pigs 
i anticipate the terminus
of gravity s rainbow 
gravity s rainbow 
it s a novel 
yeah  i know 
  i haven t read it though 
  neither have i 
nobody has 
but i like the title 
it describes
the path of a projectile
determined by natural law 
et voila  my method 
i observe the facts
without biases
of the head or heart 
i determine the arc s path 
stroll leisurely
to its terminus
and the truth
falls at my feet 
the medical examiner was ready
to rule this a suicide 
but elliott agreed to keep it
pending for 48 hours 
tomorrow morning 
i search the grounds
and the house 
begin my investigation 
i want you to be
by my side for it 
  what 
  my confidante 
my eyes and ears 
hey  wait  wait 
detective  why me 
i trust your kind heart 
also  you re the only one
who had nothing to gain
from harlan s death 
so how about it  watson 
marta  hey  detective 
if you want my insight
into the family   
none of them are murderers 
that s my insight 
and yet 
be it cruel or comforting 
this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth 
that s what it does 
always 
tomorrow at 8 00 
 knock at door on tv 
 speaking spanish 
 tv continues indistinctly 
harlan  i know
i ve missed something

i missed 
  marta  harlan

in the bathroom 
joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer 
   sighs 
  you know what  richard 
you wanna go 
you bet  skippy  let s go 
you wanna go 
come on 
you better
watch out  man 
  walt  stop it right now 
  walt  son of a bitch

donna  let go

walt  i have been waiting
for this my whole life 
  linda  stop it  right now 
  donna  i can handle myself 
  linda  stop it 
  i can handle it 
oh  my god 
 chuckles 
we gotta do this more often 
hey 
jacob 
we know
where this is going 
you were in the bathroom
next to harlan s office 
where he had the fight
with ransom 
now  you heard something 
spill it 
i just heard two things 
 indistinct chatter 
harlan     my will 
 my will  
and then there was more yelling 
and then i heard ransom say   
 i m warning you  
linda  ransom   
what s that mean 
i think it means our father
finally came to his senses
and cut this worthless
little brat out of his will 
so i guess you re gonna have
to sell the beemer
and give your notice
at the country club 
and kick whatever
fashion drug you re on 
because if you think
that after all the bridges
you ve burned 
after all the
shit you said 
after everything that
you put this family through
for the last 10 years 
that any of us
are gonna support you
that any of us
are gonna give you 
like dad liked to say 
 a single red dime    
you re nuts 
 inhales sharply 
 mouthing  wow 
son   
father 
 sighs  did harlan tell you
he was gonna cut you
out of the will 
yep 
 smacks lips 
well  then he s done
what none of us were
strong enough to do 
maybe this might finally
make you grow up 
linda 
this might be the best thing
that could
ever happen to you 
thank you  my mother 
ladies and gentlemen 
look  this is not
gonna be easy for you 
but it ll be good 
nothing good is ever easy 
up your ass  joni 
you ve had your teeth in this
family s tit for a long time 
 up your ass  
oh  very nice 
  matter of fact  eat shit 
  joni  oh  my god  ransom 
  what 
  ransom  how s that 
please do not
use that word
  in front of my son 
  in fact  eat shit  eat shit 
joni  if i wasn t practicing   
  ransom  eat shit 
  you entitled prick 
i would slap that
smug smile right off   
  definitely eat shit 
     of your goddamn face 
ransom  eat shit 
you can all eat shit 
 all clamoring 
walt  i m not eating
one iota of shit 
marta  what was that about
will readings being boring 
benoit  the exception
that proves the rule 
 door opens 
 sighs  asshole 
 i m warning you  
ransom said 
 i m warning you  
well  you heard
ransom in there 
that s the kind of
thing he says 
you want this 
you want this 
 dog barks 
what do we have here 
this looks like
a relatively fresh break 
yep  right there 
wait a minute 
well  that doesn t make sense 
where s that window 
how about some
more cookies  hugh 
  you want some more cookies 
  that s great  that s great 
walt 
hey  maybe harlan left you
a cold glass of milk
in his will  asshole 
show me 
but stay off the carpet 
 thrombeys continue arguing 
wagner  it s the trick window
from a kill for all seasons 
benoit  trooper  here  will you 
take this 
hmm 
traces of dried mud 
i suspect they go
the length of the hallway 
footprints 
benoit  no  just traces 
yeah  depending on when
this thing was last cleaned 
this could have happened
at any time  right 
no  that would
not explain this 
analyze that mud 
it will match
these traces 
take this to jamie 
benoit  and you will find
similar samples
leading up the trellis
on the outside of the house 
on the night of the party 
somebody who did not want to
be heard climbing those steps 
went to a great deal of trouble
to break into
harlan thrombey s rooms 
the game is afoot 
eh  watson 
alan  well  thank you all for
getting together like this 
it isn t legally necessary 
but i thought because
you re all in town 
and some of you
are leaving soon   
excuse me 
uh  i m sorry 
ladies and gentlemen 
i would like to gently request
that you all stay in town
until the investigation
is completed 
elliott  yeah  well 
he s gently requesting 
but i m gonna have
to make that an order 
no one move until we
figure this all out 
what 
can we ask why 
  has something changed 
  no 
no  it hasn t changed 
or no  we can t ask 
benoit  mr  stevens   
you may continue 
alan  right  well   
the other reason i thought
this gathering
would be  uh  beneficial
is because
harlan altered his will
a week before he died 
he sealed it 
he asked me not to
submit it to the courts
for probate
until after his death 
so  if anyone is confused
about anything 
we re all together 
we can talk 
although i don t imagine
any of it
is going to be
that complicated 
uh  harlan s
assets included   
um   
  the house 
  the house 
which he owned outright 
um   
 60 million 
yes   60 million
in various cash accounts
and investments 
and of course 
the real asset 
sole ownership
of blood like wine 
his publishing company 
he also wrote up a statement
when he was making the changes
and he wanted
that read first 
 dearest linda 
walter  and joni   
 some of you may be surprised
by the choice i ve made here 
 no pleasure was taken
in the exclusion 
 and its purpose
was not to sow
 greater discord in the family 
 quite the opposite 
 please accept it with grace
and without bitterness 
 but do accept it 
 it s for the best  dad  
um   
wow  well  yeah 
not too complex at all 
this will be quick 
 chuckles 
 i  harlan thrombey 
being of sound mind and body 
and yada yada yada   
 i hereby direct
that all my assets 
 both liquid and otherwise   
 i leave in their entirety
to marta cabrera 
 my entire ownership
of blood like wine publishing 
 i leave in its entirety
to marta cabrera 
 the copyright
of its catalogue likewise
 i leave in its entirety
to marta cabrera  
linda  what 
walt  uh   
  joni  what 
  no 
  that s not    that s    no 
  linda  no 
  that can t be 
  linda  no 
walt  can i see that
please  alan 
  yeah  it s right 
  please 
linda  this can t be legal 
it s right 
  you know  he was   
  donna  oh  my god 
richard 
aren t there safeguards   
joni  alan  there s a mistake 
walt  i don t know what to say 
  we re his family  so   
   laughing 
linda  it s not possible 
richard  are there safeguards
against this 
walt  right mind 
something   
  richard  you know   
  alan  listen   
  he was on medication 
  in his final days 
he was on a great deal
of medication 
richard  morphine 
all right  morphine 
  i mean  i don t know 
  joni  this is confusing 
  she seems like family   
  alan  you can take   
     but she s not our family 
     this piece of paper
and shove it right up your
ass  and get out 
and  you cops  too  out 
  richard  linda 
  linda  out  right now 
  hey  linda

hmm

walt  i can t catch up 
 clamoring 
  i understand  i understand 
  richard  open the door 
   engine stalling 
  open up that door 
  you are scaring her 
  i can t open the damn door 
  meg  marta  go  marta  go 
   engine stalling 
walt  marta

he is our father 
richard  marta  listen to me 
joni  marta  don t listen

i m not on twitter anymore 
 horn honks 
joni  so dm me
on instagram  okay 
i wanna talk to you 
 clamoring 
ransom 
what the hell s going on 
i think this could be
the best thing
to happen to all of you 
what does he
mean by that 
richard  why didn t
you stop her 
richard 
what am i supposed to do 
grab the bumper with my teeth 
 laughs 
okay  seriously  though 
what the hell 
ransom  hey 
i ll take an extra bowl 
waitress  sure 
 soft music playing 
you look like
you re gonna pass out 
have you eaten
anything today 
eat 
marta  this is a nightmare 
mmm hmm 
so why 
  why 
  why 
hey  this is everything 
there s gotta be a bigger reason
why  and you know it 
well  how about
it had to do more
with you guys
than with me 
yeah 
yeah  it s the only thing
that makes sense 
did he tell you anything 
only that i wasn t
getting a cent 
that s because
he wanted you
to build something from
the ground up like your mom 
 to build something
from the ground up  
yeah  my mother built her
business from the ground up
with a million dollar loan
from my grandfather 
my father owns none of it 
she made him sign a prenup 
he lives in fear 
and i know that s what
my grandfather was trying
to protect me from
by doing this
and i know i shouldn t say
this out loud 
but when he told me  i   
jesus 
i coulda killed him 
after i left the party though 
i was driving 
nowhere  just in the night 
and i had this  um   
clarity 
like  from here on out 
i was gonna have to
fend for myself 
and that felt   
good 
the old bastard 
 sighs 
marta  i know
three things 
one   
i know he didn t
commit suicide 
  what makes you think that 
  i don t think it 
i know it 
because i knew my granddad 
maybe you and i were
the only two who knew him 
so you re not gonna bullshit me
on this because  two   
i know lying makes you puke 
 cause of that mafia game
last fourth of july 
 clicks tongue  and three   
i know you just ate
a full plate of baked beans
and sausage 
so   
look me in the eye
and tell me what happened
to my grandfather 
  you asshole 
  marta 
tell me everything 
 sighs 
walt  alan  there have got
to be options here 
alan  no 
i don t know
how many times
i can repeat the same
two pieces of information 
if harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes 
and we all
confirmed that he was   
would a sound mind do this 
how    sound  how 
the very action
speaks to unsoundness 
not legally  no 
you not liking what he did
does not speak
to testamentary capacity 
what about
undue influence 
yeah  undue influence 
how about that  huh 
did you just google that 
look  if marta was
manipulating dad somehow
  and if we found out   
  if somehow  she had gotten   
     that somehow she was   
     her hooks into him   
you need a strong
case for that 
 your honor 
she endeared herself to him
 through hard work
and good humor  
that won t cut the salami 
joni  what about
the slayer rule 
i did just google that 
the slayer rule obviously
doesn t apply here 
well  what the hell
is the slayer rule 
well  it s if
someone is convicted
of killing the person 
they don t get
their inheritance 
not even convicted 
even if they re
held responsible
for their death
in civil court 
like o j  
yes  like o j 
but harlan committed suicide 
joni  detective blanc 
you said
the investigation is ongoing 
you made a point of that 
do you suspect foul play 
mr  blanc 
if you please   
there is much
that remains unclear 
but yes 
i suspect foul play 
   breathes deeply 
  marta 
i have eliminated
no suspects 
you re full of shit 
i don t trust this guy
in the tweed suit 
and  alan  god bless you 
you re useless 
thank you 
there s only one
answer to this 
she has to renounce
the inheritance 
she knows it s
what she should do 
  that s exactly what she   
  it s the right thing to do 
  right 
  no way   
richard  it s the moral thing 
  meg  mom 
  richard  she ll do it 
if granddad wanted to give
marta everything 
then that s what he wanted 
no 
this wasn t him  he loved us 
he wanted us taken care of 
he wanted you
to have an education 
meg 
you think i can pay
for your school 
 scoffs 
 chuckles softly 
i know 
just saying it 
it sounds insane 
but it s all true 
and i think blanc s been
on to me from the start 
i don t care if i go to
jail  but my mom 
my sister 
we   
you gonna say something 
i always thought
i was the only one
that could beat him at go 
always thought
that meant something 
um  yeah  i know you did 
that night at the party 
my last
conversation with him   
my last argument 
that s what he
told me about you 
that you beat him at go more
than i do  and i thought   
what a strange
thing to tell me 
think i get it now 
maybe it did mean something 
 clears throat 
i m not gonna tell
my family shit 
you re not gonna go to jail 
that detective is not
gonna catch you 
and you re not gonna
give up the money 
this is what granddad
wanted for you 
i mean  think about what he
did to go through with this 
he wanted this for himself 
he wanted this for the family 
and he wanted it for you 
you ve come this far 
let me help you
go all the way 
what s going on 
this isn t you 
you could just
turn me in right now
and still get your cut
of the inheritance 
why 
because fuck my family 
i can help you
get away with this 
and then 
you re gonna give me
my cut of the inheritance 
 chuckles softly 
happy ending  everybody wins 
you  me   
harlan 
yeah 
deal 
 cell phone buzzing 
meg 
meg  marta   
that was nuts 
i know 
are you okay 
yeah  are you 
yeah  yeah  i m fine  i   
look  no one knows
i m calling you  i just   
i wanted to   
i wanted to say sorry
for how everyone was 
and  uh   
i guess  i wanted to ask 
what are you gonna do 
what do you mean 
well  the   
you know  with the will 
what are you gonna do 
what do you
think i should do 
you should do
whatever you think is right 
mmm hmm 
look  i   
i think you should
give it back to us 
 scoffs 
granddad always
took care of us 
you know  we re his family 
and i know
he was like family to you 
but we re his actual family 
yeah 
and    look  marta 
you know this isn t fair 
we ve always been good to you
and you re like family 
and we ll take care of you 
but you have
to make things right 
you know what s right 
marta   
mom s broke 
and she says i m gonna
have to drop out of school 
no  no  no  meg 
listen  i won t
let that happen 
whatever money you need 
i ll give it to you 
i m here for you 
and i want you to know
i m gonna take care of you 
i promise that 
okay 
thanks 
  and once i   
   cell phone beeps 
okay then 
did blanc find anything
suspicious at the house 
 sighs 
yes  he found mud upstairs 
where i broke in
through the window 
 softly  shit 
identifiable prints 
no 
good  okay 
good  hey   
you lay low
for a couple days 
wait for this investigation
to blow over 
and it will 
 cause no matter how good
this blanc guy thinks he is 
he s got nothin  
hey  relax 
   loud knock on door 
   gasps 
marta  get your ass up 
what the hell
is happening 
there s a guy here 
and a bunch of stuff 
everything s going crazy 
are we rich 
maybe  alice 
i don t know 
alice  i don t even know
what that means 
but you better get
your ass up  okay 
 speaks spanish 
we don t know much
about marta cabrera 
  or her exact relationship   
  oh  my god   
     with harlan thrombey   
  marta  what is all this 
     beyond being his home nurse 
  what did you do 
is that here 
oh  yeah  it is 
   indistinct chatter outside 
  wait  so is that true 
are we rich 
newscaster  this is
a story so compelling   
oh  my god 
   you would think he had
written the story himself 
 opera music playing 
 footsteps approaching 
benoit  good morning 
mrs  thrombey 
why is grief
the providence of youth 
i don t know 
but i d imagine that age
deepens all feelings 
including grief 
this was a long walk
to offering condolences
for the loss of your son 
and asking you 
if it isn t presumptuous of me 
not to think too harshly
of your family 
if i am  as i suspect 
the first to console you 
they re young  aren t they 
one thing i assume of age
is weariness 
damned if i don t get
more tired every day 
tired of what i do 
following arcs
like lobbed rocks 
the inevitability of truth 
but the complexity and the gray
lie not in the truth
but what you do with the truth
once you have it 
i think you have something
you wanna tell me 
i think you re
very perceptive
and very capable of
telling me what you saw
the night
of your son s party 
but i ll happily wait 
i m in no rush 
in fact 
i find it quiet pleasant
sitting here with you 
 opera music continues 
lawyers were here 
very big lawyers 
it looked like 
they left all this stuff
and business cards 
and there was
a pile of other stuff
  when i got home 
   speaking spanish 
 in english  i don t like
any of this  marta 
 speaks spanish 
 in english 
i don t like it either 
i m slipping out the back 
i ll be back later 
please don t talk to anyone 
 speaks spanish 
walt 
yeah  i came  uh   
hey  how you doin  
 chuckles 
walt  i want you to know
that i didn t know
about any of this 
  we know you didn t 
  this is   
we know you didn t 
yeah  we all kind of went
a little crazy yesterday 
  understandable 
  yeah 
i haven t even
looked at all this  yet 
walt  it must just be
local lawyers and accountants
who saw the news
and wanna get a jump on it 
yeah  i d be careful
of all of it 
marta  is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance 
this is what harlan wanted 
 sighs 
yeah  but   
harlan put you in a very hard
position here  i mean 
it was unfair of him 
i mean  you see
the kind of press and scrutiny
that this kicks up
and we know 
with your mother   
my mother 
yeah 
what did meg tell you 
oh  this isn t about   
 chuckles 
you re missing the point 
we don t wanna
attack you with this 
but  marta  if your mother
came into the
country illegally 
criminally 
and you ve come
into this inheritance 
with all the scrutiny
that entails 
i d be afraid
that could come to light 
and that s what
we wanna avoid here 
we can protect you
from that happening 
or if it happens 
so you re saying that
even if it came to light 
with your family s resources 
you could help me fix it 
yeah 
yeah  with the right
lawyers  you know 
not these local guys 
but new york lawyers 
dc lawyers 
with enough resources
put toward it  yes 
not that that ever even
needs to come up 
but  yes 
okay  good 
okay 
because harlan gave me
all your resources 
so that means
with my resources 
i ll be able to fix it 
so i guess
i will find the right lawyers 
uh  marta  that s   
you better be sure that s
what you want 
 cell phone buzzing 
 birds chirping 
ransom  i don t know   
what s this 
marta  it s my
medical bag tag 
they have my medical bag
for some reason 
okay  but this is a photocopy
of just the header
of a blood toxicology report
on harlan 
marta  this is gonna show
the morphine overdose 
 breathing heavily 
so i m screwed 
how do you know all this stuff 
i was harlan s research
assistant for a summer 
but what kind of
blackmail scheme is this 
i mean  the actual evidence
is sitting up the street 
at the crime lab 
there s no demands 
there s no meeting place 
what s the point
in sending you this 
 siren wailing 
fire chief  it could be
a half hour 
it could be an hour 
it depends 
we wanna make sure   
 whistles 
fire chief 
so  it could take a while 
  benoit  what s the cheese 
  but i ll let you know 
  elliott  oh  hey 
  fire chief  yeah 
  elliott  thank you  chief 
  fire chief  no problem 
5 00 a m 
security systems
here are all triggered 
now  this thing
went up really quick 
so that means
blood stores  records 
anything of that nature 
it s all gone 
there were no
employees here 
  so  thank god for that 
  mmm hmm 
what about security cameras 
oh  yeah 
speaking of security 
the surveillance tape
at the thrombey estate
was all scrambled
for some reason 
yeah 
what s still pending
from the autopsy 
just a report
on the blood work 
blood work 
marta  holy shit 
this is insane 
i mean  who would blow up
a whole real building
just to blackmail me 
marta  this means
the blackmailer
has the only paper copy
of the thing that
can prove your guilt 
you didn t get
any other instructions 
no phone call 
no email  nothing 
no 
well  i haven t
checked my email 
there is one 
ransom  yeah  that s it 
 1209  columbus road  10 a m  
you know
what this means  right 
if you destroy that copy 
you re totally in the clear 
marta  oh  no 
marta  did you hear me 
marta  yeah 
 tires squeal 
elliott 
we gotta go 
we gotta go 
  okay  baby driver 
  oh  god

 sirens wailing 
marta  oh  shit 
 cell phone vibrating 
vehicles in pursuit
  on washington street

murder suspect

 engine rumbling

 cell phone vibrating 
 horn honking 
 mouthing

to get this tox report 
it s all over 
oh  my god 
 brakes screech 
  whoa

in the middle of the road 
 sirens continue wailing 
hold on 
 horn honking 
marta  oh  my god  i m just

holy shit  ransom 
hey  thank you 
i couldn t do this without you 
   indistinct radio chatter 
  oh  my god 
get out 
that was the dumbest
car chase of all time 
put your hands down 
i spoke to wanetta thrombey 
greatnana 
night of the party 
she saw someone
climbing the trellis
to the third floor 
  mr  drysdale  come on

elliott  pat him down 
check him out 
marta  what s going on 
benoit   ransom came back

when he saw me coming 
yes 
 stomach gurgles 
 gags  retches 
elliott 
blanc  coming with us 
benoit  i ll drive with marta 
let s go to the
police station 
i want a full rundown
on everything he said to you 
i ll catch you up
on where we re at 
strange case from the start 
a case with a hole
in the middle 
a donut 
i m just talking
through my process here 
let me know
if this is boring 
i feel the noose tightening 
the family is
truly desperate 
desperate motives 
the mystery of who hired me 
the impossibility of the crime 
and yet   
a donut 
one central piece
and if it reveals itself 
the fog would lift 
the arc would resolve 
the slinky become unkinked 
do you mind
if i stop for a second 
i need to pick something up 
it ll be very quick 
sure 
it ll be just a few minutes 
watch the  uh 
door 
 indistinct chatter 
marta  hello 
 water dripping 
listen  i don t know
what you want   
whatever it is 
we can work it out 
but we have to figure it out
right here  right now 
and i m leaving
with that report 
hello 
 gasps 
fran 
 wheezing 
 gasps 
no  no  no  no  fran 
   stifled gasping 
  oh  my god  fran

fran  give me a sign
if you can hear me 
  you   
  yes  it s me  it s marta

  copy   
stashed

jesus  stop it 
 stifled groaning 
 line ringing 
 fran gasps softly 
 gasping stops 
dispatcher  911 
what s your emergency 
  the thought of you
stays bright
 siren wailing 
  sometimes i stand
in the middle of the floor
  not going left
  not going   
oh  lord 
 indistinct announcement
over pa 
benoit  all right  my friend 
thank you for the update 
no need for that 
i ll bring her in
once we get word
that the housekeeper
is stable 
it s still
touch and go 
all right 
listen  this is over 
people are getting hurt 
so i m gonna
tell you the truth 
young ransom just told
lieutenant elliott everything 
good 
wait  i hope he
didn t cover for me 
did he tell you
the real truth
  about me switching the   
   sighs  yeah 
  and the disguise bit 
  yes 
and the whole blackmail and   
mmm hmm 
but why did fran
take my morphine 
i mean  obviously she had
swiped the bag from the house 
but she didn t seem like
a user to me 
unless that s why she needed
the blackmail money 
i don t know 
it doesn t matter anyway 
i have to tell the
thrombeys myself 
i feel like i owe that to them 
i don t think
that s a good idea 
no  i have to do it 
i need to do it 
i gave the doctors
my number 
so they ll call if anything
changes with fran 
all right 
i ll round up the thrombeys
at the house 
along with a police escort 
for the arrest after 
you can tell me your whole
story on the drive over 
i don t want
any more surprises 
marta  fran said
it was stashed 
the copy  and then she said 
 you did this 
you won t get away with it  
and i called the ambulance 
that s it 
all right 
  you ready 
   sighs softly 
richard  oh 
okay 
well  has she
come to her senses 
well  she s standing
right there  richard 
she can speak for herself 
is the rest
of the family here 
walt  in the living room 
i think that it
would be better
if we were to gather again
and get this over with 
  hey 
  hey 
i m so sorry i told
them about your mom 
meg  it s okay 
i m sorry  no   
i was scared  i just   
i didn t wanna tell them 
i get it 
trust me 
i understand 
it s all right 
 sniffles  i m sorry 
 sighs  chuckles 
god  i am so raiding
fran s stash after this 
benoit  i still think
this is a bad idea 
but the family is assembled 
i know where
the tox report is 
she basically told me
where it was 
anyways  this will
tie everything up 
and i just
handed it to you 
god  you re not much
of a detective  are you 
well  to be fair 
you make
a pretty lousy murderer 
perhaps we
deserve each other 
you ve always
been good to me 
and what i m about to say
isn t gonna be easy
and you re gonna
be upset 
but i thought after
what you ve gone through
the last few days 
that you deserved
to hear it from me 
hmm 
  i   
  excuse me 
you have not been good to her 
you have all
treated her like shit 
to steal back a fortune
that you lost 
and she deserves 
you re a pack of vultures
at the feast 
knives out  beaks bloody 
well     inhales sharply 
you re not getting bailed
out  not this time 
ms  cabrera has
decided  definitively 
not to renounce
the inheritance 
  what 
  what 
furthermore  it will be
my professional recommendation
to the local authorities
that the manner of death
in the case of harlan thrombey
is ruled as suicide 
  and the case is closed 
  blanc 
what 
thank you all for coming 
goodbye 
what s going on 
just tell me   
that s certainly not
what i was expecting 
  donna  no 
   dog growls 
richard 
is anybody else confused 
walt  not what i was expecting
to hear at all 
 chuckles 
are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on 
yes  yes 
i just wanna come clean  okay 
  it s over 
  almost 
blanc  what are we doing 
  what s going on 
  i m sorry  officer wagner 
keep the family
out of this room 
and get  em out of
the house if you can 
but stand by
with your additional officer 
get the family out 
yes  but not all of them 
would you     whispers 
thank you 
  elliott  blanc   
  wagner  yes  sir 
come on  come on 
what s all this drama 
  indulge me 
  marta  blanc 
i told ransom  ransom told you 
and i m telling you now 
it is an immovable fact
that i killed harlan 
yes  you did  yes  he did 
yes  you are 
but    but  i spoke in the car
about the hole
at the center of this donut 
and what you and harlan did
that fateful night
seems at first glance
to fill that hole perfectly 
a donut hole in a donut s hole 
but we must
look a little closer 
and when we do 
we see the donut hole
has a hole in its center 
it is not a donut hole 
but a smaller donut
with its own hole
and our donut
is not whole at all 
blanc  look  i understand that
this is amusing for you   
why was i hired 
why would someone hire me 
elliott  someone fishing
for a crime
to reverse the will  blanc 
come on 
but i was hired before
the sealed will was read 
so  yes 
the person must have known
the contents of the will 
but one step further 
that same person must have
known a crime was committed 
and further   
if the intent was to reverse
marta s inheritance 
they must have known
that marta was responsible 
an intriguing combination
of factors 
someone who knew
what marta did
wanted to expose it
but could not reveal
how they knew 
fran 
she was blackmailing me 
she knew what i did 
yeah  but fran wanted money 
ergo she did not want
the crime exposed 
what if someone
in the family had observed
marta doing
something suspicious 
but they would have had
no reason not to speak up 
 sighs 
the answer
is not so simple 
now with the entire solution
in my field of view 
the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors 
 sighs  marta it will not
be easy for you to hear 
but there is at least
one truly guilty party
behind it all 
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice
and committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent 
trooper wagner 
trooper wagner 
no 
marta  i m so sorry 
i told them everything 
i figured it was up 
i m sorry 
hey  it s all right  ransom 
i m glad you did 
not exactly
everything though 
marta  is this about
what greatnana told you 
she saw me that night 
she mistook me for ransom 
we ll get to that 
in the meanwhile 
mr  hugh ransom drysdale 
you might tell us all
why you hired me 
why i hired you 
you re right 
let s back it up   
to the night of the party 
your argument with harlan 
what were the overheard words
by the nazi child
masturbating in the bathroom 
 my will   and
 i m warning you  
you and harlan
were drama mamas 
you shared a love of twisting
the knife into one another 
you see  i don t believe
he would have
slipped it in halfway 
no  no  no 
i submit
harlan told you everything 
you can t be serious 
not a red dime
or word of my work
to a single one of them 
you included 
marta 
remind me what ransom said
his conversation
with harlan ended with 
harlan told him that
i could beat him at go 
benoit  and i asked myself 
 marta 
 why would the topic of the will
 have steered around
to marta  
there is one
obvious explanation   
you can t be that crazy 
you re not just gonna
throw away your fortune 
no  i m giving it to marta 
all of it 
 scoffs 
your brazilian nurse 
are you goddamn insane 
i m sane for the first time
in my life 
  and i ve done it 
  harlan  if you think
i m gonna let this happen 
if you think i m gonna
stand here and   
i ve made the change
to my will  it s done 
i m warning you 
that s some
heavy duty conjecture 
granted 
but it is the only way
what comes next makes sense 
so you storm out 
you drive off into the night 
you tell marta later   
what was it 
feeling an overwhelming sense of   
clarity 
that he had to make do
for himself from here on out 
exactly 
 brakes screech 
marta  the will  harlan 
 do for yourself  
 you won t get away with this  
and a plan forms 
you return 
careful to avoid the gate s
security camera range 
then on foot up
towards the house 
you sneak in up the trellis 
so as not to be seen
by the rest of the family
who are still having
their party downstairs 
what you need to do
will take moments 
but it is essential that you
are alone and undetected 
you knew what
medications harlan took 
you knew what marta would be
injecting him with that night 
and you knew
if marta was responsible
for his death 
even unintentionally 
the slayer rule would nullify
the changed will
and you would
get your share back 
you used
the syringes in the kit
to switch the liquids
in the two medication vials 
and as a final precaution   
you took the naloxone 
the lifesaving antidote 
marta  no  no  no  no 
that s impossible 
benoit  that is the truth 
hand me that vial of morphine 
i ll show you 
if he did that 
if the meds were switched 
then when i got them
mixed up  i   
i accidentally
switched them back 
so i gave harlan   
benoit  the correct doses 
yes 
but not accidentally 
i taped over the label
of these two vials 
the vials themselves
are identical 
how d you know
this was the morphine 
i just knew 
you knew because
there is the slightest 
almost imperceptible
differences
of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids 
you knew because you ve
done it a hundred times 
you gave him
the correct medication
because you are a good nurse 
then harlan was   
i m sorry  marta  but yes 
  harlan was perfectly fine 
  oh  my god 
his blood was normal 
the cause of death was truly 
solely suicide 
and you are guilty
of nothing but some damage
to the trellis
  and a few amateur theatrics 
   sighs 
in fact 
if harlan had listened to you
and called the ambulance 
he would be alive today 
damn 
benoit  a twisted web
and we are not finished
untangling it 
not yet 
marta  when greatnana
spotted you
climbing down
the trellis  she said   
ransom 
are you back again already 
benoit   are you back
again already  
 cause earlier that night   
 panting 
ransom  you re back 
 scoffs  come on  marta 
this is stoopid with two o s 
you don t have
a shred of evidence 
you re just
spinning a fairy tale 
not a shred  no 
just as we have no real proof
of marta mixing up the vials 
so it s your word   
you have her confession 
all right  yeah 
yeah  we do have that 
with your permission 
i d like to spin
a little further 
much later that night 
you d have to come back
to the house   
to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials 
however  this time
the dogs were outside 
 dogs barking 
benoit  they barked 
waking meg 
no matter 
you ll get the vials tomorrow 
but tomorrow brings news   
not of a medical error
and a guilty nurse 
but of a slit throat
and a suicide 
now the circumstances
are perfect
for the anonymous hirin  of me 
you know a crime has been
committed by miss cabrera 
you need her
to be caught for it 
you cannot reveal
how you know 
enter   
benoit blanc 
benny  look   
i hear what you re saying 
but this   
 shushing 
the body is discovered early
the next morning 
the police 
the medical examiner 
the family 
everyone swarms in
and there is no possible way
you can get to
marta s medical bag
to retrieve the vials 
you must wait
for your moment 
when the investigation
is over
and you know
the house will be empty 
and that is why
you missed the funeral 
there is no one home to wonder
why you re going
into harlan s study 
or so you think 
 zipper opening 
poor fran 
she witnessed you tampering
with harlan s medication
in the medical bag 
she did not know
what you were doing 
but she knew
you were up to no good 
so her mind begins to turn 
marta  oh  god 
that hallmark movie
she told me about 
with danica mckellar   
deadly by surprise 
marta  that s what
she was talking about 
benoit  she loved harlan 
she hates ransom 
so the poor girl decides
to test her theory 
and make this asshole pay 
she gets a copy
of the toxicology report 
now  i will be honest 
i have no idea how 
 cause she has a cousin 
she told me 
she has a cousin
who works as a receptionist
at the examiner s office 
well  voila 
the numbers 
they mean nothing to her 
but if ransom is guilty 
its existence is a threat
so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note 
so why did she send it to me 
she didn t 
she sent it to ransom 
and when mr  drysdale gets it 
what is his reaction 
elation 
he still thinks marta
has given harlan
the tampered drugs 
a blood tox report
will prove her guilt 
he goes to the will reading
in high spirits 
ready to see the family
tear itself apart 
secure in the knowledge
it will be all undone
when the tox report
comes to light 
and then   
 inaudible 
benoit  marta s confession 
and everything
turns on its head 
he now realizes that marta
has committed no crime
and the tox report
will prove her innocence 
the changed will
is gonna stand 
he has lost 
 scoffs 
unless   
unless you decide   
you re not gonna give up
the money 
you re not gonna give up
the money 
you ve come this far 
you ve come this far 
just one step further 
just one last act 
in for a penny  in for a pound 
you decide you are in 
 glass shattering 
benoit  step one   
 fire roaring 
destroy all evidence
of marta s innocence 
 shattering 
step two 
send her the anonymous email
with a late morning
rendezvous time   
and deliver her
the blackmail note 
step three 
keep your
appointment with fran 
fran  oh  i knew it 
i knew you were a no good
son of a bitch 
i knew harlan wouldn t
just kill himself 
ransom  yes  fran 
you were right 
fran  i knew you were
guilty as shit 
and now
you re gonna pay for it 
don t you come near me 
don t come near me 
i m warning you 
 muffled screaming 
benoit  see  now 
now the board is set 
marta will get
the blackmail note 
you ll put the pieces
together for her 
you ll guide her
to the rendezvous 
you ll make the anonymous call
to the police 
they will catch her there
with the body
and the burned evidence 
marta will get arrested
for killing fran
and harlan 
she said   
you did this 
she didn t say   
 you did this  
she wasn t talking about me 
she said   
hugh did this 
 hugh did this  
 cause you made the help
call you hugh 
 cause you re an asshole 
and it would have worked
if we hadn t have brought you
in for questioning
so you could not make
your anonymous call 
and if fran had not stashed
a safety copy of the tox report 
and if marta had not
outplayed you once again 
by having a kind heart 
by saving fran s life
though it meant
her losing the inheritance
and going to jail 
she didn t play your game 
she saved fran s life 
fran s alive 
oh  yes 
  fran   
   cell phone buzzing 
   who will confirm
this very story
or something close to it 
and send you  hugh 
to jail 
 cell phone buzzing 
yes 
doctor  that s great news 
we ll be there soon 
thank you 
she s okay 
she s ready to talk 
benoit  trooper wagner 
if you could  uh 
keep mr  drysdale in custody
while lieutenant elliott 
ms  cabrera and myself 
we go to the hospital
and take fran s statement 
all right 
up  come on 
 scoffs

just to you

just you 
 cause you know it s true

into our home

our granddad 
we welcomed you
into our family 
and now you think
you can steal it from us 
you think i m not gonna fight
to protect my home 
our birthright 
our ancestral family home 
 laughing loudly 
that is hooey 
harlan  he bought
this place in the  80s
from a pakistani
real estate billionaire 
oh  shut up  blanc
