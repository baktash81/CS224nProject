for this transmit it to the ship
alert
area 12
the android is out of control
report
hes headed toward the village
were trying to stop him
over there
magnify
hold your fire
what is it
base to commander data
rerouting microhydraulic
power distribution
regulating thermal overload
data report immediately
transferring matrix functions
engaging secondary protocol
hes trying to remove the headpiece
all field units
intercept the android
artim its all right
get inside now
everyone get inside now
back to your homes
secondary protocol is active
they can see him
stop him now
commander data stand down
thats an order stand down
who are they
its an mclass planet
population 300 million
say the greeting again
yewchin cheffaw
you either need a new uniform
or a new neck
my collar size hasnt changed
of course not
our guests
are eating the floral arrangements
no cocktails before dinner
my god are they vegetarian
does the chef have a dressing
that goes well with chrysanthemums
captain picard command wants
to know our eta at the goren system
the goren system
some territorial dispute
if we delay our trip to hanoran ii
itll put us in the monsoon season
captain
the diplomatic corps is busy
so we get to put out another fire
can anyone remember
when we used to be explorers
deck 10
remember theyre not
as advanced as we are
theyve just achieved warp drive
now theyre a protectorate
with the borg and the dominion
we need all the allies we can get
captain on deck
regent cuzar likes to dance
can she mambo
very funny
the captain cuts quite a rug
la forge to picard i need to talk
to you before the reception
mr worf what are you doing here
i was at the
hes late can it wait
i dont think so
tell him to come up here
the captain wants you to join us
theres a communiqué from
admiral dougherty about data
yewchin cheffaw regent cuzar
welcome aboard
captain picard i welcome you
in the tradition of my people
we are so honoured to be accepted
within the great federation family
we have a dance later
i look forward to it
counsellor
nice bead work
captain admiral dougherty is aboard
a sona ship in sector 441
hes requesting datas schematics
he doesnt say why
data was only scheduled to observe
the baku village for a week
geordi set up a secure comlink
to the admiral
hars adislo we met at the
nel bato conference last year
did you read my paper
on thermionic transconductance
would you excuse me
hes not acknowledging
any starfleet protocol
what precipitated this behaviour
i dont know now he has hostages
we could be there in two days
thats not a good idea your ship
hasnt been fitted for this region
there are environmental concerns
such as
were studying various anomalies
they call this area the briar patch
weve had trouble
even getting a signal to you
just get me datas schematics
ill keep you informed
his emotion chip
he didnt take it with him
send the admiral datas schematics
report to the galley and tell
the chef to skip the fish course
id like our guests to depart
as soon as etiquette allows
im going to ask worf
to delay his return to ds9
we can stop by sector 441
on our way to the goren system
they are in opposite directions
are they
i should never have let you
talk me into that duck blind
federation procedures have made this
more difficult than it needed to be
we have to protect the planets
population from unnecessary risk
planets population
600 people
if you want to avoid unnecessary
risks leave your android at home
we are approaching the planet
take us into a high orbit
lie down the girls
will take 20 years off your face
another time perhaps
your selfrestraint puzzles me
you deny yourself every benefit
this mission has to offer
such benefits are to be shared
with all the people of the federation
report
phaser blast unknown origin
raise shields
take us out of orbit
photon torpedoes
the vessel has broken off pursuit
visual contact
thats our ship
were about to lose
communications with starfleet
you got everything from command
i have all files on the duckblind
mission and the sona
you have two days
to become experts
mr worf we need a plan
to safely capture data
la forge has modified this tricorder
with one of datas actuation servos
its range is only four metres
but it will shut him down
good to have you back
slow to one third take us in
half a century ago
they conquered two primitive races
and integrated them into
their culture as a labour class
the sona have produced quantities
of the narcotic ketracelwhite
their ships are rumoured to be
equipped with outlawed weapons
why are we involved with them
good question
you havent done that in a while
what
what youre doing to my neck
whats that
bridge to commander worf
worf
captain
i dont know how they do it on ds9
here we still report for duty on time
sorry sir im on my way
well skip the court martial
when was the last time
we aligned the torque sensors
two months ago
they dont sound right
they are out of alignment
by 12 microns you could hear that
when i was an ensign i could
detect a 3micron misalignment
the sona ship with adm dougherty
has entered tracking range
straighten your baldric
on screen
captain i wasnt expecting you
this is important to the enterprise
data attacked us in the mission
scout ship yesterday
ruafo and i have decided
to send in an assault team
worf and i are working out
tactical plans
your android has turned
dangerously violent
my ship has been damaged
he must be destroyed
i know what data means to starfleet
but our crew are in danger on the planet
if our attempt to capture data fails
i will terminate him
i should be the one to do it
im his captain and his friend
all right you have 12 hours then
i want you out of the briar patch
well head out to the perimeter
to call for sona reinforcements
understood
good luck captain
dougherty out
were not picking up any ships
try a wideband covariant signal
the rings must be
masking his approach
the metaphasic radiation from the rings
is in a state of extreme flux
come out come out
wherever you are
sir
thats something my mother
hold on
open all hailing frequencies
data this is captain picard
please respond
if we fire tachyon bursts
hell have to reset his shields
then we can beam him out
make it so
direct hit his shields are down
beam him out
hes using a transport inhibitor
prepare to enter the atmosphere
that will shake him
scanners are offline
start evasive manoeuvres
he can fly a ship and anticipate
our tactics his brain is functioning
we know how he responds to threats
i wonder how he would respond
do you know gilbert  sullivan
no ive not had a chance
to meet all the new crew members
theyre composers
from the 19th century
data was rehearsing hms pinafore
just before he left
a brltish tar is a soaring soul
as free as a mountain bird
his energetic fist should be ready
to resist a dictatorial word
sing worf
his nose should pant
and his lips should curl
his cheeks should flame
and his brow should furl
his bosom should heave
and his heart should glow
and his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow
his nose should pant
and his lips should curl
his cheeks should flame
and his brow should furl
his bosom should heave
and his heart should glow
and his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow
prepare the docking clamps
his eyes should flash
wlth an inborn fire
his brow wlth scorn be wrung
he never should bow down
to a domineering frown
or the tang of a tyrant tongue
his heart should stamp
and his throat should growl
his hair should curl
and his face should scowl
his eyes should flash
and his breast protrude
and this should be
his customary attitude
his foot should stamp
and his voice should drop
his hair should curl
and his face
if we do not release him
he may destroy both vessels
im not letting go of him
we must stabilise
all power to inertial dampers
the autosequencer is damaged
transfer control to manual
autosequencer realigned
engaging stabilisers
damping field established
maximum power
now mr worf
commander data is safely in custody
captain subahdar gallatin
lt curtis doughertys attaché
are you all right
weve been treated extremely well
they have incredible
mental discipline and perception
my name is sojef
jeanluc picard
dr crusher and counsellor troi
would you like something to eat
no were here to rescue them
as you wish i would ask you
to disarm yourselves
this village is a sanctuary of life
prepare the hostages for transport
they should be quarantined
before joining the ships population
we believed they were being held
against their will
its not our custom
to hold anyone against their will
the android told us they were our
enemies and that more would follow
are you our enemy
noninterference in other cultures
is my peoples prime directive
your directive apparently doesnt
include spying on other cultures
the android is a member of my crew
apparently he was taken ill
we were unable to repair the phase
variance in his positronic matrix
the captain finds it hard to believe
we possess such technical skills
not applying our technological
abilities is a matter of choice
creating a machine to do mans work
takes something away from man
at one time we explored the galaxy
just as you do
you have warp capability
capability yes
but where can warp drive take us
except away from here
i apologise for our intrusion
because they have warp capability
the consequences will be minimal
terrific job now pack your bags
and get the hell out of there
hows data
la forge is doing the diagnostic
ill read the paperwork tomorrow
rendezvous with us
to transfer crew and equipment
on your way out
youre not finished here
just a few loose ends to tie up
come in
have you got a minute
sure
i need a little counselling
thats a first
do i lie down or what
whatever makes you comfortable
but it isnt a therapeutic posture
but it is comfortable
why dont you try sitting up
why dont you try lying down
youre in quite a mood today
did you just come down here to play
im having a midlife crisis
i believe you
im not sleeping well
dr crusher can help
what i need
i cant get from dr crusher
can two people go back in time
and fix a mistake theyve made
on this ship anythings possible
yuk
i never kissed you with a beard
i kiss you and you say yuk
i reconstructed datas neural net
and replaced these memory engrams
how were they damaged
by a sona weapon
theres no doubt about it
thats why data malfunctioned
but the sona claimed they didnt fire
till after he malfunctioned
i dont believe it happened that way
why would they fire on him first
all i know is that he functioned normally
until he was shot
his ethical and moral subroutines
then took over
so he still knew the difference
between right and wrong
the system prevents anyone from
taking advantage of his memory loss
yet he attacked us
and told the baku we were a threat
are the implants bothering you
no im just tired
geordi captain
youre on the enterprise data
i seem to be missing
several memory engrams
there they are
whats the last thing you remember
his nose should pant
from the mission
i was gathering
physiometric data on the baku
i followed some children into the hills
artim where were you
the day the android appeared to us
in the hills by the dam
can you show us
there is no reason to fear me i am
operating within normal parameters
they fixed me
the boy is afraid of me
its nothing personal
these people rejected technology
i am technology personified
that young man has never seen
a machine that walks and talks
bridge to riker
can i get back to you worf
its admiral dougherty
patch him through
yes admiral
why havent you left orbit
picard is still on the surface
he wants to find out
why data malfunctioned
his future at starfleet
depends on it
remind the captain
his 12 hours are up
yes sir
dougherty out
your body is producing
far too many toxins
weve reached the limit
of genetic manipulation
i wont need any more
genetic manipulation
if our federation friends will
allow us to complete this mission
tricorder functions are limited
due to kelbonite deposits in the area
how about a passive radiation scan
there appear to be strong neutrino
emissions coming from the lake
can he breathe underwater
data doesnt breathe
wont he rust
no
captain
i believe i know what is causing
the neutrino emissions
the vessel
is clearly federation in origin
just a few loose ends
to tie up
were not interested in this
i am
it would be wiser
im going with you
it is a holographic projection
incomplete i might add
this is a computerdriven image
created by photons and forcefields
i know what a hologram is
why would anyone want
to create one of our village
if you were following the children
and discovered this ship
i may have been shot to protect
the secret of its existence
why would they duplicate this village
except to deceive the baku
deceive us
to move you off this planet
youd fall asleep in your village
and wake up
on this flying holodeck
transported en masse
and in a few days
relocated on a similar planet
without ever realising it
why would the federation
wish to move the baku
i dont know
computer end program
decloak the vessel
help
i cant swim
dont panic
ive been shot at on a ship
that has come to abduct us
whats there to panic about
for water landings i am designed
to serve as a flotation device
did the hostages mention
anything about a cloaked ship
no sir
debrief them again
have you been in a fight
no it is a gorch
a pimple sir
well its hardly noticeable
smooth as an androids bottom
i beg your pardon
dougherty noticed we havent left
were not going anywhere
deck 5
klingons never do anything small
dr crusher asked to speak to you
picard to crusher
the sona hostages
declined to be examined
and our people
theyre fine
in fact theyre better than fine
improved muscle tone high energy
very well doctor
dont release the sona officers
until ive talked to ahdar ruafo
commander may i
computer music
not that something latin
specify
the mambo
thats more like it
how old are you
our solar system was on the verge
of selfannihilation
technology had created weapons
that threatened to destroy all life
a small group of us
set off to find a new home
a home that would be isolated
from the threats of other worlds
that was 309 years ago
and you havent aged since then
i was a lot older when we arrived
in terms of my physical condition
theres a metaphasic radiation
coming from the planets rings
it regenerates
our genetic structure
you must have noticed the effects
weve just begun to
i suppose youre 75
no im 12
the radiation wont affect him
until he reaches maturity
what you have here is more valuable
than goldpressed latinum
thats the reason someone may be
trying to take your world from you
the android was right
if it wasnt for data its probable
that you would be relocated by now
how can we defend ourselves
if we fight we become like them
we lose everything we are
it may not come to that
the architects of this conspiracy
want to keep it a secret
not only from you
but from my people as well
i dont intend to let them
weve always known that to survive
we had to remain apart
it hasnt been easy
many of the young people want
to know more about the offland
theyre attracted to stories
of a faster pace of life
most of my people would
sell their souls to slow life down
but not you
there are days
you dont live up to your reputation
as an offlander
in defence of offlanders
there are many more people like me
who wouldnt be tempted
by the promise of perpetual youth
you give me more credit than
i deserve of course im tempted
but some of the darkest chapters
in the history of my world
involve the forced relocation
of one people to satisfy another
i had hoped that we had learned
from our mistakes
but it seems
that some of us havent
extraordinary craftsmanship
its the work of students
theyre almost ready
to become apprentices
in 30 or 40 years
some of them will become artisans
apprenticing for 30 years
did your peoples mental discipline
develop here
more questions
always the explorer
if you stay that will change
will it
you stop reviewing the past
stop planning for tomorrow
let me ask you a question
have you ever experienced
a perfect moment in time
when time seemed to stop and you
could almost live in that moment
seeing my home planet from space
for the first time
yes exactly
nothing more complicated
than perception
you explore the universe
we discovered that a single moment
in time can be a universe in itself
full of powerful forces
most people arent aware enough
of the now to even notice
i wish i could spare
a few centuries to learn
it took us centuries to learn that
it doesnt have to take that long
theres one thing
i dont understand
in 300 years
you never learned to swim
i havent got around to it yet
i wonder if youre aware
of the trust you engender
its unusual
for an offlander
for someone so young
geordi
captain
there wasnt anything wrong
with my implants
there was something right
with my eyes
dr crusher found that the cells
around my optic nerve had
started to regenerate
it may not last
and if it doesnt
i just wanted before we go
you know ive never seen a sunrise
at least not the way you see them
come
am i to understand
that youre not releasing my men
we found the holoship
let the captain and me
no
this entire mission has been one
federation blunder after another
return my men or this alliance will
end with your ships destruction
youre looking well jeanluc
rested
i wont let you move them i will
take this to the federation council
im acting on their orders
to abandon our prime directive
these people are not indigenous
theyre not meant to be immortal
well be restoring them
to their natural evolution
who the hell are we to determine
the course of evolution
there are 600 people there
the regenerative properties of
this radiation could help billions
the sona can collect metaphasic
particles from the planets rings
the planet is in federation space
our planet their technology
a technology we cant duplicate
you know what that makes us
partners
our partners are petty thugs
on earth petroleum once turned
petty thugs into world leaders
warp drive created a romulan empire
we can handle the sona
we probably said the same
about the romulans
lifespans will be doubled an entire
new medical science will evolve
your chief engineer has the use
of his eyes for the first time
will you take that away from him
with the whole briar patch why
does it have to be this one planet
the concentration in the rings
makes it work
theyll inject something into
the rings and start a reaction
the planet will be uninhabitable
delay them let us study it
our best scientific minds
cant find any other way to do this
the sona can establish a separate
colony on the planet until we do
it would take ten years exposure
to reverse their condition
some of them
wont survive that long
and who would want
to live in the briar patch
the baku
we are betraying the principles upon
which the federation was founded
its an attack upon its very soul
and it will destroy the baku
cultures have been destroyed
in every forced relocation in history
jeanluc
were only moving 600 people
how many people does it take
before it becomes wrong
a million
how many people does it take
youll proceed to the goren system
and release the sona officers
file whatever protests you wish to
by the time you do
this will all be done
gallatin
the righteous starfleet captain
finally released you
any problems on the surface
no sir
but it wasnt easy being among them
im sure
just dont forget
what they did to us
well have them rounded up
in a day or two
we neednt bother
with a holoship any more
get the holding cells ready
im going to miss these little
fleshstretching sessions of ours
rerouting the transport grid
to avoid detection was wise
however the transporter
is rarely used after 0200 hours
going out for a spin
seven tons of explosives
tetryon pulse launchers
and isomagnetic disintegrators
a hunting trip
return to your quarters
thats an order
no uniform no orders
how can i look at a sunrise knowing
what my sight cost these people
exposure could stimulate rebellious
instincts common to youth
which would affect everyones
judgement except mine
what do you think we should do
saddle up
lock and load
they wont begin the procedure
while the planet is inhabited
ourjob is to keep
