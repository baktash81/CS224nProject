  say the greeting again 
  yew chin chef faw 
you either need a new uniform
or a new neck 
  my collar size hasn t changed 
  of course not 
our guests
are eating the floral arrangements 
  no cocktails before dinner 
  my god  are they vegetarian 
does the chef have a dressing
that goes well with chrysanthemums 
captain picard  command wants
to know our eta at the goren system  
  the goren system 
  some territorial dispute 
if we delay our trip to hanoran ii 
it ll put us in the monsoon season 
captain   
  the diplomatic corps is busy 
  so we get to put out another fire 
can anyone remember
when we used to be explorers 
deck 10 
remember  they re not
as advanced as we are 
  they ve just achieved warp drive 
  now they re a protectorate 
with the borg and the dominion 
we need all the allies we can get 
captain on deck 
  regent cuzar likes to dance 
  can she mambo 
  very funny 
  the captain cuts quite a rug 
la forge to picard  i need to talk
to you before the reception  
  mr worf  what are you doing here 
  i was at the   
  he s late  can it wait 
  i don t think so    
  tell him to come up here 
  the captain wants you to join us 
there s a communiqué from
admiral dougherty about data  
yew chin chef faw  regent cuzar 
welcome aboard 
captain picard  i welcome you
in the tradition of my people 
we are so honoured to be accepted
within the great federation family 
  we have a dance later 
  i look forward to it 
  counsellor    
  nice bead work 
captain  admiral dougherty is aboard
a son a ship in sector 4 4 1 
he s requesting data s schematics 
he doesn t say why 
data was only scheduled to observe
the ba ku village for a week 
geordi  set up a secure com link
to the admiral 
hars adislo  we met at the
nel bato conference last year 
did you read my paper
on thermionic transconductance 
would you excuse me 
he s not acknowledging
any starfleet protocol  
  what precipitated this behaviour 
  i don t know  now he has hostages  
we could be there in two days 
that s not a good idea  your ship
hasn t been fitted for this region  
  there are environmental concerns  
  such as 
we re studying various anomalies  
they call this area the briar patch  
we ve had trouble
even getting a signal to you  
just get me data s schematics  
i ll keep you informed  
  his emotion chip 
  he didn t take it with him 
send the admiral data s schematics 
report to the galley and tell
the chef to skip the fish course 
i d like our guests to depart
as soon as etiquette allows 
i m going to ask worf
to delay his return to ds9 
we can stop by sector 4 4 1
on our way to the goren system 
  they are in opposite directions 
  are they 
i should never have let you
talk me into that duck blind 
federation procedures have made this
more difficult than it needed to be 
we have to protect the planet s
population from unnecessary risk 
planet s population 
600 people 
if you want to avoid unnecessary
risks  leave your android at home 
  we are approaching the planet  
  take us into a high orbit 
lie down  the girls
will take 20 years off your face 
  another time  perhaps 
  your self restraint puzzles me 
you deny yourself every benefit
this mission has to offer 
such benefits are to be shared
with all the people of the federation 
  report 
  phaser blast  unknown origin 
raise shields 
  take us out of orbit 
  photon torpedoes 
  the vessel has broken off pursuit 
  visual contact 
that s our ship 
we re about to lose
communications with starfleet 
you got everything from command 
i have all files on the duck blind
mission and the son a 
you have two days
to become experts 
mr worf  we need a plan
to safely capture data 
la forge has modified this tricorder
with one of data s actuation servos 
its range is only four metres 
but it will shut him down 
good to have you back 
slow to one third  take us in 
half a century ago 
they conquered two primitive races
and integrated them into
their culture as a labour class 
the son a have produced quantities
of the narcotic ketracel white 
their ships are rumoured to be
equipped with outlawed weapons 
  why are we involved with them 
  good question 
  you haven t done that in a while 
  what 
  what you re doing to my neck 
  what s that 
bridge to commander worf  
  worf  
  captain 
i don t know how they do it on ds9 
here we still report for duty on time 
  sorry  sir  i m on my way  
  we ll skip the court martial 
when was the last time
we aligned the torque sensors 
  two months ago 
  they don t sound right 
they are out of alignment
by 12 microns  you could hear that 
when i was an ensign  i could
detect a 3 micron misalignment 
the son a ship with adm  dougherty
has entered tracking range 
straighten your baldric 
on screen 
captain  i wasn t expecting you  
this is important to the enterprise 
data attacked us in the mission
scout ship  yesterday  
ru afo and i have decided
to send in an assault team  
worf and i are working out
tactical plans   
your android has turned
dangerously violent 
my ship has been damaged 
he must be destroyed 
i know what data means to starfleet  
but our crew are in danger on the planet  
if our attempt to capture data fails 
i will terminate him 
i should be the one to do it 
i m his captain and his friend 
all right  you have 12 hours  then
i want you out of the briar patch  
we ll head out to the perimeter
to call for son a reinforcements  
  understood 
  good luck  captain  
dougherty out  
  we re not picking up any ships 
  try a wide band covariant signal 
the rings must be
masking his approach 
the metaphasic radiation from the rings
is in a state of extreme flux 
come out  come out
wherever you are    
  sir 
  that s something my mother   
hold on 
open all hailing frequencies 
data  this is captain picard 
please respond 
if we fire tachyon bursts 
he ll have to reset his shields 
  then we can beam him out 
  make it so 
  direct hit  his shields are down 
  beam him out 
  he s using a transport inhibitor 
  prepare to enter the atmosphere 
that will shake him 
  scanners are off line 
  start evasive manoeuvres 
he can fly a ship and anticipate
our tactics  his brain is functioning 
we know how he responds to threats 
i wonder how he would respond   
do you know gilbert   sullivan 
no  i ve not had a chance
to meet all the new crew members 
they re composers 
from the 19th century 
data was rehearsing  hms pinafore 
just before he left 
a brltish tar is a soaring soul
as free as a mountain bird
his energetic fist should be ready
to resist a dictatorial word
sing  worf 
  his nose should pant
  and his lips should curl
  his cheeks should flame
  and his brow should furl
  his bosom should heave
  and his heart should glow
and his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow
his nose should pant
and his lips should curl
his cheeks should flame
and his brow should furl
his bosom should heave
and his heart should glow
and his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow
prepare the docking clamps 
his eyes should flash
wlth an inborn fire
his brow wlth scorn be wrung
he never should bow down
to a domineering frown
or the tang of a tyrant tongue
  his heart should stamp
  and his throat should growl
  his hair should curl
  and his face should scowl
  his eyes should flash
  and his breast protrude
and this should be
his customary attitude
his foot should stamp
and his voice should drop
his hair should curl
and his face    
if we do not release him 
he may destroy both vessels 
i m not letting go of him 
  we must stabilise 
  all power to inertial dampers 
  the auto sequencer is damaged 
  transfer control to manual 
auto sequencer realigned 
engaging stabilisers 
  damping field established 
  maximum power 
now  mr worf 
commander data is safely in custody 
  captain  subahdar gallatin 
  lt  curtis  dougherty s attaché 
  are you all right 
  we ve been treated extremely well 
they have incredible
mental discipline and perception 
  my name is sojef 
  jean luc picard 
dr crusher and counsellor troi 
  would you like something to eat 
  no  we re here to rescue them 
as you wish  i would ask you
to disarm yourselves 
this village is a sanctuary of life 
prepare the hostages for transport 
they should be quarantined
before joining the ship s population 
we believed they were being held
against their will 
it s not our custom
to hold anyone against their will 
the android told us they were our
enemies  and that more would follow 
are you our enemy 
non interference in other cultures
is my people s prime directive 
your directive apparently doesn t
include spying on other cultures 
the android is a member of my crew 
apparently  he was taken ill 
we were unable to repair the phase
variance in his positronic matrix 
the captain finds it hard to believe
we possess such technical skills 
not applying our technological
abilities is a matter of choice 
creating a machine to do man s work
takes something away from man 
at one time  we explored the galaxy 
just as you do 
  you have warp capability 
  capability  yes 
but where can warp drive take us
except away from here 
i apologise for our intrusion 
because they have warp capability 
the consequences will be minimal 
terrific job  now pack your bags
and get the hell out of there  
  how s data  
  la forge is doing the diagnostic 
i ll read the paperwork tomorrow  
rendezvous with us
to transfer crew and equipment
on your way out  
  you re not finished here 
  just a few loose ends to tie up  
come in 
  have you got a minute 
  sure 
  i need a little counselling 
  that s a first 
do i lie down  or what 
whatever makes you comfortable 
but it isn t a therapeutic posture 
  but it is comfortable 
  why don t you try sitting up 
why don t you try lying down 
you re in quite a mood today 
did you just come down here to play 
  i m having a mid life crisis 
  i believe you 
  i m not sleeping well 
  dr crusher can help 
what i need
i can t get from dr crusher 
can two people go back in time
and fix a mistake they ve made 
on this ship  anything s possible 
yuk 
  i never kissed you with a beard 
  i kiss you  and you say  yuk  
i reconstructed data s neural net
and replaced these memory engrams 
  how were they damaged 
  by a son a weapon 
there s no doubt about it 
that s why data malfunctioned 
but the son a claimed they didn t fire
till after he malfunctioned 
i don t believe it happened that way 
why would they fire on him first 
all i know is that he functioned normally
until he was shot 
his ethical and moral subroutines
then took over 
so he still knew the difference
between right and wrong 
the system prevents anyone from
taking advantage of his memory loss 
yet he attacked us
and told the ba ku we were a threat 
  are the implants bothering you 
  no  i m just tired 
  geordi  captain 
  you re on the enterprise  data 
i seem to be missing
several memory engrams 
there they are 
what s the last thing you remember 
  his nose should pant    
  from the mission 
i was gathering
physiometric data on the ba ku 
i followed some children into the hills 
artim  where were you
the day the android appeared to us 
  in the hills by the dam 
  can you show us 
there is no reason to fear me  i am
operating within normal parameters 
they fixed me 
  the boy is afraid of me 
  it s nothing personal 
  these people rejected technology 
  i am technology personified 
that young man has never seen
a machine that walks and talks 
bridge to riker  
  can i get back to you  worf 
  it s admiral dougherty  
patch him through 
yes  admiral 
  why haven t you left orbit 
  picard is still on the surface  
he wants to find out
why data malfunctioned  
his future at starfleet
depends on it 
remind the captain
his 12 hours are up 
  yes  sir 
  dougherty out  
your body is producing
far too many toxins 
we ve reached the limit
of genetic manipulation 
i won t need any more
genetic manipulation
if our federation friends will
allow us to complete this mission 
tricorder functions are limited
due to kelbonite deposits in the area 
how about a passive radiation scan 
there appear to be strong neutrino
emissions coming from the lake 
can he breathe underwater 
data doesn t breathe 
  won t he rust 
  no 
captain 
i believe i know what is causing
the neutrino emissions 
the vessel
is clearly federation in origin 
 just a few loose ends
to tie up  
  we re not interested in this 
  i am 
  it would be wiser   
  i m going with you 
it is a holographic projection 
incomplete  i might add 
this is a computer driven image
created by photons and forcefields 
i know what a hologram is 
why would anyone want
to create one of our village 
if you were following the children
and discovered this ship   
i may have been shot to protect
the secret of its existence 
why would they duplicate this village
except to deceive the ba ku 
  deceive us 
  to move you off this planet 
you d fall asleep in your village
and wake up
on this flying holodeck 
transported en masse 
and in a few days
relocated on a similar planet
without ever realising it 
why would the federation
wish to move the ba ku 
i don t know 
computer  end program 
de cloak the vessel 
help 
i can t swim 
don t panic 
i ve been shot at on a ship
that has come to abduct us 
what s there to panic about 
for water landings  i am designed
to serve as a flotation device 
did the hostages mention
anything about a cloaked ship 
  no  sir 
  debrief them again 
  have you been in a fight 
  no  it is a gorch 
a pimple  sir 
well    it s hardly noticeable 
  smooth as an android s bottom 
  i beg your pardon 
  dougherty noticed we haven t left 
  we re not going anywhere 
deck 5 
klingons never do anything small 
  dr crusher asked to speak to you 
  picard to crusher 
the son a hostages
declined to be examined 
  and our people 
  they re fine 
in fact they re better than fine 
improved muscle tone  high energy 
very well  doctor 
don t release the son a officers
until i ve talked to ahdar ru afo 
commander  may i    
computer  music 
  not that  something latin 
  specify  
the mambo 
that s more like it 
how old are you 
our solar system was on the verge
of self annihilation 
technology had created weapons
that threatened to destroy all life 
a small group of us
set off to find a new home 
a home that would be isolated
from the threats of other worlds 
  that was 309 years ago 
  and you haven t aged since then 
i was a lot older when we arrived 
in terms of my physical condition 
there s a metaphasic radiation
coming from the planet s rings 
it regenerates
our genetic structure 
  you must have noticed the effects 
  we ve just begun to 
  i suppose you re 75 
  no  i m 12 
the radiation won t affect him
until he reaches maturity 
what you have here is more valuable
than gold pressed latinum 
that s the reason someone may be
trying to take your world from you 
the android was right 
if it wasn t for data  it s probable
that you would be relocated by now 
  how can we defend ourselves 
  if we fight  we become like them 
  we lose everything we are 
  it may not come to that 
the architects of this conspiracy
want to keep it a secret 
not only from you 
but from my people  as well 
i don t intend to let them 
we ve always known that to survive
we had to remain apart 
it hasn t been easy 
many of the young people want
to know more about the offland 
they re attracted to stories
of a faster pace of life 
most of my people would
sell their souls to slow life down 
but not you 
there are days 
you don t live up to your reputation
as an offlander 
in defence of offlanders 
there are many more people like me 
who wouldn t be tempted
by the promise of perpetual youth 
you give me more credit than
i deserve  of course i m tempted 
but some of the darkest chapters
in the history of my world
involve the forced relocation
of one people to satisfy another 
i had hoped that we had learned
from our mistakes 
but it seems
that some of us haven t 
  extraordinary craftsmanship 
  it s the work of students 
they re almost ready
to become apprentices 
in 30 or 40 years
some of them will become artisans 
apprenticing for 30 years   
did your people s mental discipline
develop here 
more questions 
always the explorer 
  if you stay  that will change 
  will it 
you stop reviewing the past 
stop planning for tomorrow 
let me ask you a question 
have you ever experienced
a perfect moment in time 
when time seemed to stop  and you
could almost live in that moment 
seeing my home planet from space 
for the first time 
yes  exactly 
nothing more complicated
than perception 
you explore the universe 
we discovered that a single moment
in time can be a universe in itself 
full of powerful forces 
most people aren t aware enough
of the now to even notice 
i wish i could spare
a few centuries to learn 
it took us centuries to learn that
it doesn t have to take that long 
there s one thing
i don t understand 
in 300 years 
you never learned to swim 
i haven t got around to it yet 
i wonder if you re aware
of the trust you engender 
  it s unusual   
  for an offlander 
for someone so young 
  geordi 
  captain 
there wasn t anything wrong
with my implants 
there was something right
with my eyes 
dr crusher found that the cells
around my optic nerve had   
   started to regenerate 
it may not last 
and if it doesn t   
   i just wanted  before we go   
you know  i ve never seen a sunrise 
at least not the way you see them 
come 
am i to understand
that you re not releasing my men 
we found the holoship 
  let the captain and me   
  no 
this entire mission has been one
federation blunder after another 
return my men  or this alliance will
end with your ship s destruction 
you re looking well  jean luc 
rested 
i won t let you move them  i will
take this to the federation council 
i m acting on their orders 
to abandon our prime directive 
these people are not indigenous 
they re not meant to be immortal 
we ll be restoring them
to their natural evolution 
who the hell are we to determine
the course of evolution 
there are 600 people there 
the regenerative properties of
this radiation could help billions 
the son a can collect metaphasic
particles from the planet s rings 
  the planet is in federation space 
  our planet  their technology 
a technology we can t duplicate 
you know what that makes us 
  partners 
  our partners are petty thugs 
on earth  petroleum once turned
petty thugs into world leaders 
warp drive created a romulan empire 
we can handle the son a 
we probably said the same
about the romulans 
lifespans will be doubled  an entire
new medical science will evolve 
your chief engineer has the use
of his eyes for the first time 
will you take that away from him 
with the whole briar patch  why
does it have to be this one planet 
the concentration in the rings
makes it work 
they ll inject something into
the rings and start a reaction 
  the planet will be uninhabitable 
  delay them  let us study it 
our best scientific minds
can t find any other way to do this 
the son a can establish a separate
colony on the planet until we do 
it would take ten years  exposure
to reverse their condition 
some of them
won t survive that long 
and who would want
to live in the briar patch 
the ba ku 
we are betraying the principles upon
which the federation was founded 
it s an attack upon its very soul 
and it will destroy the ba ku 
cultures have been destroyed
in every forced relocation in history 
jean luc 
we re only moving 600 people 
how many people does it take
before it becomes wrong 
1 000 
50 000 
a million 
how many people does it take 
you ll proceed to the goren system 
and release the son a officers 
file whatever protests you wish to 
by the time you do 
this will all be done 
gallatin 
the righteous starfleet captain
finally released you 
  any problems on the surface 
  no  sir 
  but it wasn t easy being among them 
  i m sure 
just don t forget
what they did to us 
we ll have them rounded up
in a day or two 
we needn t bother
with a holoship any more 
get the holding cells ready 
i m going to miss these little
flesh stretching sessions of ours 
re routing the transport grid
to avoid detection was wise 
however  the transporter
is rarely used after 02 00 hours 
  going out for a spin 
  seven tons of explosives 
tetryon pulse launchers
and isomagnetic disintegrators 
  a hunting trip 
  return to your quarters 
  that s an order 
  no uniform  no orders 
how can i look at a sunrise  knowing
what my sight cost these people 
exposure could stimulate rebellious
instincts common to youth
which would affect everyone s
judgement    except mine 
what do you think we should do 
saddle up 
lock and load 
they won t begin the procedure
while the planet is inhabited 
ourjob is to keep
