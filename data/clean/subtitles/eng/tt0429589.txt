just because of me

i was working on an experiment 
oh  yes  i see 
well  we were    how may i be of service 
zoc  attacks from the destroyer
grow more frequent 
our food supplies
are now desperately low 
the council was hoping
perhaps you might have a solution 
fight back  we must stop the destroyer 
but thousands of ants
would needlessly die 
perhaps if we could communicate 
you know  just talk with the human 
oh  what a great idea 
let s have a nice chat 
well  hello  destroyer 
gee  you look kind of tired 
why don t you just rest your feet
on my girlfriend 
okay  oka   
sometimes you re a real stinkbug 
you know that 
zoc  a war with the human is   
it s impossible 
a wizard knows no such word

  he s inside out 
where are you taking me  help 
who are you  what did you do to me 
let me go 
human   
   you have been brought
before the council   
   to face judgment
for crimes against the colony 
read the charges 
 this human destructor beast   
   hereafter referred to
as peanut the destroyer   
   did willfully
and with malice aforethought   
   crush the food storage chambers   
   flood all of the lower
hatching chambers   
   and douse the colony
with the dreaded yellow rain  
hey  come on  i had to go 
sentencing of the human
will be handed down   
   by the queen herself 
greetings  my children   
   and to our unusual guest   
   a human that threatens
the very existence of our colony 
wait a second  wait  wait  wait 
time out 
how was i supposed to know
ants had feelings or families or trials 
  you re just a bunch of stupid ants 
  destroy the destroyer 
  throw him in the pit 
  let s eat him 
no  wait  we are not mindless savages 
this human should be studied 
  and then we ll eat him 
  yeah 
eat  eat  eat 
order  order 
be still  be still 
tonight we have a choice 
we could destroy this human
and make safe this day 
or we could change
the nature of this human   
   and perhaps create
a brighter future for all ants 
i therefore sentence the human
to live and work in the colony   
   to learn our ways 
he must become an ant 
  what 
  no  no  my queen 
what if he does not become an ant 
okay  i mean  come on 
that would be regrettable 
but    but who will teach him our ways 
  i will 
  hova 
it is done 
let us continue our work 
that s it 
how long am i gonna be like this 
i wanna go home

yes  it is 
hello  peanut 
destroyer 
hello  we have to go 
it s time to start your training

   and not get eaten by anything 
  well  hello there

he s male 
okay  lucas  you re on the blue team 
  oh  man  that s not fair 
  come on 
hey  hey  hey  quiet 
and suck in that thorax 
like everything in the colony 
foraging is a team effort 
in this test  each team must act
as a single unit to avoid obstacles   
   retrieve the sweet rock
and return to the nest 
no ant gets left behind 
first team back wins 
any questions 
  hello  baby 
  fugax 
well  isn t it true that scout ants 
such as myself   
   lead an exciting life of adventure
and intrigue 
  fugax 
  while foragers  such as you   
   just walk around and pick up sticks 
questions  anyone 
  oh  sir

what kind of adventures 
well  i m glad you asked 
  fugax

lucas  you did fine  really 
you just need to discover the ant within 
start by visualizing yourself with six legs 
  then  if you   
  how s that gonna get me home 
look at me  i m not a stupid ant 
lucas  being an ant means more
than just having six legs or   
or lifting 10 times your own weight
or walking vertically up a wall   
   it s being part of a colony 
not always thinking of yourself first 
  oh  careful 
  hey  don t touch me 
i m trying to help you 
you think this is easy for me 
being the destroyer s little helper 
so you worry about you 
and i ll worry about me 
oh  lucas

well  if i could just

lucas the destroyer 
i take back everything
i thought about you 
you saved us 
thank you  lucas 
yeah  sure 
he saved us 
oh  it s so obvious  i was so dumb 
praise the destroyer

the rest of us just   
just got in the way 
zoc  oh  are you all right 
  no  i m   
  what happened to you 
i m fine  i m fine 
  you re hurt 
  no  it s nothing  really  i just   
zoc  do you have any yucca sap 
lucas has a burn  poor baby 
this is our enemy 
they do not save ants  they kill ants 
he very nearly killed me 
or does that not matter to you 
i do  you do
we all like the honeydew
dinner is served 
and i m the dessert 
and i m on a low fathead diet 
and you know  it looks good on you 
so  lucas  what are you working on 
glasses 
this is some good honeydew 
oh  lucas  you have to try some 
it s so good 
go ahead 
this is awesome 
tastes like green apple bubble gum 
that went away quick 
another round for you 
oh  yeah  keep it coming 
get it while it s hot 
whoa  i didn t know
humans could change their colors 
  trippy 
  perhaps our young pupa   
   ate too much honeydew 
here  eat this 
it ll make you feel better 
what did that come out of 
it s an alka root 
zoc discovered its powers to expel evil
and create well being 
he is a great wizard 
yeah  he hates me 
whoa  he really does  doesn t he 
i mean  he hates your guts 
it s actually amazing
how much he hates your guts 
okay  i m sorry 
yes  zoc has anger issues 
especially towards humans   
   but he s a true ant 
hard on the outside 
but soft on the inside 
just give him time  lucas 
praise the mother 
praise the mother 
thanks 
who is this mother
you keep talking about  anyway 
is it the queen 
no  lucas  the ant mother 
the queen of queens 
she gave birth to the first colony 
to all ants 
come on  it s time for you to see 
this is the chamber of the ages 
what are these 
they tell the story
of our colony  our history 
these are pretty cool 
this is the image of the ant mother 
it is said that one day she will return   
   and honeydew will pour
from the sky like rain 
then we will never go hungry again 
so you actually want warm poop
to fall from the sky 
yes  that would be a blessed day 
i m sorry  it s just so beautiful 
hey  what s that one 
it s the evil one 
the cloudbreather 
it is ancient  drawn before our time 
no one knows for sure what it is 
except that death is said to follow it 
i think it s just a story used
to scare naughty pupas into behaving 
no  the exterminator 
l    i gotta cancel him 
i gotta go home now 
but you re not an ant yet 
  just a quick visit 
  no way  two legs

to show you something  if that s okay 
you know what this is 
this is the potion that will
make you big again 
i just wanted you to take
a good  long look at it 
because this is the last time
you will ever see it 
what do you mean 
i mean  there is no way i am ever
going to make you big again 
ever  you are a threat
to every ant in this colony 
especially to hova 
but i would never do anything
to hurt hova 
i just    i   
i just wanna go home 
well  then  if i were you   
   i d try to find help somewhere else 
because there is nothing for you here 
nothing 
the pain  the pain  it s unbearable 
just put me out of my misery 
oh  hold still  you big pupa 
i haven t even touched you yet 
be gentle with me 
  where s lucas 
  isn t he with you

some other poor  unfortunate colony 
you know how they are  destroyers 
zoc  what have you done 
  me  what did i do 
  where is he 
he s gone 
  he led you into a trap  hova 
  there was no trap 
he led us to food 
he was trying to protect us from   
  from what  what  hova 
  from something 
oh  something 
and i was worried it was from nothing 
he s blinded you  hova 
no  you are the one who s blind 
you are so consumed
by your hatred for the humans   
   you see only what you want to see 
  oh  come on 
zoc  i see a young pupa 
a human learning our ways   
   becoming part of this colony 
becoming an ant 
  impossible 
  listen to yourself  zoc 
 a wizard knows no such word  
so  what are you now 
certainly not the ant i love 
hova 
i did it for you  for the colony 
you did it for yourself 
hova  i   
he won t make it
through the night alone 
fugax  your leg s broken 
yeah  but i still have five good ones 
very good ones 
you know  i believe he was trying
to protect us from something 
see you  zoc 
maybe zoc is right

moving along in due course 
always with the negative with you 
why can t you be more    hey  lenny

lenny always has a smile on his face   
let me out  let me out 
  i don t wanna be a toadstool 
   a toadstool   that s great

  hey  froggy 
no relationship is worth this 
oh  sure  why not  come on in 
  welcome to paradise 
  zoc  how d you get here 
i sure didn t come in
through the rear entrance 
welcome  make yourself at home  hi 
who is this  your ant 
zoc  you are crazy 
you re inside a frog  for mother s sake 
what are you doing  this is impossible 
 listen to yourself  zoc 
a wizard knows no such word 
so  what are you now  
weirdo 
what does she see in you 
  what does she see in you 
  exactly 
not me 
  hey  is that    
  alka root  so it is 
  oh  no 
  oh  my 
you might wanna let go of that 
oh  no  so you can grab it 
i don t think so 
  hands in the air 
  oh  my 
wow  that was great 
hey  we sure owe you one 
thanks a lot 
i m free  i m free 
oh  crap 
hey  zoc  thanks  but why d you do it 
an ant will sacrifice himself
for his friends 
  i thought you hated me 
  i didn t do it for you 
all right  well  we should
camp here for the night 
come on  fugax  let s forage some food 
excuse me  i don t forage 
i ll scout for food 
right  let s go 
zoc  stay with lucas 
he s been through a lot today 
  hova  please  don t ask me to   
  he s not what you think 
there is goodness in him 
there s an ant in him 
see  he really is trying 
come on  you can do it 
  concentrate 
  one  two  three 
think ant  ant  ant 
yeah  all right 
craznocks 
it s funny 
the sky looks exactly the same 
everything else is so different   
   but it s the same sky  the same stars 
why must you keep doing that 
  are you ill 
  what  oh  you mean yawning 
  i m just tired 
  please stop  it s disgusting 
  ants don t yawn 
  definitely not  thank you 
so this city of yours  it s like a nest 
well  yeah  kind of 
and the humans that live there
are all brothers   
   working together
for the greatness of their colony 
well  not exactly 
it s a little more like 
you know  every man for himself 
but that s so primitive 
how does anything get done 
some people work together 
some  why not all 
i suppose it s because
of their differences 
but it s the differences
that make a colony strong 
foragers  scouts  drones 
nurses  regurgitators   
   all are different 
but an essential part of the whole 
this is where we ants draw our strength 
my differences just get me beat up 
  and why is that 
  i don t know 
some humans prefer to clobber people
they don t understand 
like you prefer to clobber ants 
i guess i didn t think
about what i was doing 
seems to happen a lot 
i suppose sometimes i  too 
can act without thinking 
perhaps in this way  we are alike 
good night  lucas 
good night  zoc 
  what s the matter 
  look 
  what is it  what s wrong 
  i see her 
  who her 
  the ant mother 
she s come  she s here 
look  look 
what do you know 
there really is an   
no 
cloudbreather 
but i cancelled the contract 
praise the mother 
  praise the mother 
  she s come at last 
everyone  please  calm down 
listen to me  it is not the ant mother 
  it is a cloudbreather 
  it s true 
he s come to wipe out the entire colony 
how can we possibly fight back 
his magic is strong 
sprayers 
foggers 
oh  that s the stuff 
zappers 
sulfur bombs 
and how do you know of this creature 
because

that s it  zoc  you shrunk me 
you can shrink the cloudbreather 
we can load these things up and then 
right in the ear 
yes  yes  perhaps 
but the cloudbreather
towers above us like a tree 
how do we get close enough 
i ve got an idea 
zoc  you would trust this human 
yoo hoo  hello
