georges kingdom was being threatened
by a terrifying intruder

if you dont mind me saying so
the apes
are supposed to be a fascinating sight
especially that white ape
white ape whats that
ask mr kwame
i bet he can tell you
it is only a native legend
could you please tell us
the people say he is
over seven feet tall
with the strength of a lion
when the moon is full
and the air is sweet
he wanders alone
through the jungle
piercing the silence of the valley
with his mournful call
now some say he is
thirsty for blood
others say he is calling
for the mate that he longs for
but will never find
by day he rules the entire bukuvu
from the top of the mountain
but by night
he and bigfoot run the candy counter
at the bukuvu cineplex
now playing on all 14 screens
planet of the apes
bigfoot max thatd be worth
a lot more than any white
ursula what are we doing here
lyle i came all this way
okay okay
the things i do for you
looks like were on fellows
as the sun rose
over ape mountain
its agitated inhabitants sent an urgent
message to george by bongogram
warning the jungle king that
intruders were close afoot
ooh lyle listen
what was that
could be the mating call
of the white ape
huh white ape
sounds like a drink
uh yes bartender ill have
two black russians and a white ape
a drink the venal van de groot
would be begging to imbibe
if he only knew how near the white ape
was at that very moment
flying through the foliage
surveying the scenery cruising in
for a closer look and swinging on
through the trees with effortless ease
ow
and so onward and upward
the tired trekkers trudged
on feverish footsies
over perilous paths
when they finally beheld the mighty
ape mountain they reacted with awe
aww
i said awe awe
ooh
thats better
single file on the bridge
step very cautiously
it is full of rotten planks
one false move you could fall over
then you will have
a very long time to wave goodbye
dont you worry peanut
i was on a bridge like this in maui
it was steady as a rock
see
hey sstop stop that
stop that what th
yeehaw
i got you
no
dont worry
nobody dies in this story
they just get
really big booboos
what did i tell you
you know they shouldnt let
inexperienced guides
like that on these treks
did you see the look
that guy just gave me
probably saying im the biggest jerk
theyve ever seen in their lives
probably trying to think
of something evil to do to me
if they turn on us
were never gonna get home

the perfectly permed heiress
ursula stanhope
awoke to the melodious music of the
bukuvu bird life and found herself
venturing forth in search
of that defender of the innocent
protector of the weak
and allaround good guy
george of the jungle

myself in a tree house
with room service and a tarzan wannabe
wearing a um um

about this fella
shes not a fella george shes
a woman the female of your species
you mean ape and george
not brothers
well in a sense
we are related
after all were both members
of the primate family
primate family brothers
i suppose one might claim
that there would
mommy make that monkey
stop talking
perhaps i should refrain from speaking
around her as it seems to upset her
what your name

ursula stanhope

george
george primate
and that brother ape
ape primate
ah oh um
okay im gonna
pass out again now

lion buddies jump me from behind
so in this version
there are two lions with the white ape
a minute ago
there was only one
hhey the important thing
kwame is that i was outnumbered
absolutely
ursula
hi when i woke up this morning

on a desperate search to find
her fianc uh that guy she was with
lyle lyle
ursula ursula
while he desperately
searched for her
but by the end of the afternoon
her desperation had dimmed
that was fantastic
and she had given up

company from her precarious perch
atop his faithful doggy

one day i looked up
and there you were

listening to some inner call
swimming blindly to throw
myself upon your shore
what if i dont find you
when i have landed

on your shore stranded

the dog howls at the moon
i think i know why

all my life
hoping for a miracle
ive been waiting day and night
day and night
ive been waiting for you all my life
waiting for redemption
ive been waiting day and night
i burn for you
and so it came to pass
that george of the jungle
attended his first coed dance
but his rapturous rendezvous with the
urban heiress was to be shortlived
as the very next morning kwame and
his men were drawing dangerously close
that is dangerously close to shoving
a coconut up lyles sleeping bag
thats it ive had it
i am the richest smartest handsomest
guy here so i get to go first
theres an elephant around here
bad guy falls in poop
classical element of physical comedy
now comes the part where we throw
our heads back and laugh ready

those were nowhere near
properly digested
in case anybodys
wondering im okay
have you cleaned my lighter yet
come on come on
that was ursula

and preternaturally wealthy
ursula stanhope
whisked george off on a private jet
bound for the country of his birth
where he would get the finest
medical treatment available
im gonna get you the finest
medical treatment available
as for those pesky pernicious
and putrid poachers max and thor
they awaited their fate
in the bujumbura jail

meanwhile kwame and his men faced
the nexttoimpossible task
of picking out georges assailant
from a lineup of the usual suspects
too short too sweaty

and so jazzed on java
george of the jungle made his way
into the city by the bay
whoo
quickly taking to tourism
the jungle king enjoyed
the first drivethrough
dining of his life
and strolled the city streets until
he found something so scintillating
he had to say
ooh
but nothing excited
the jungle king more
than the sight of the biggest
rope bridge he had ever seen
ooh yeah
help
ooh
somebody help
to swing or not to swing
help
swing
as the king of the jungle
quickly calculated the angle
and velocity of his next big swing
ursula felt like jumping
off a bridge herself
i feel so guilty
i dont know what im going to do
first thing i suggest you tell your
father what you came here to tell him
hi daddy

the most remarkable thing

where a parasailor dangles
helplessly 500 feet above the water

of rope in his hand

big brave queen of jungle

hi ursula
emboldened with jungle juju

ursula stanhope went inside
to break the news to her parents
who took it extremely well
mother daddy
i love you both very much
i have something
very important to tell you
and i hope youll understand
i dont want to marry lyle any more
we understand dear
just kidding
the young miss stanhope
proceeded to spill the beans
so anyway i went to the jungle
very quickly
until she got to
the important part at the end
then lyle shot him so lyle
is in jail and george is with me
and i dont want to marry
lyle any more
i knew it its that swinging man
from the bridge
i saw you smooching on tv
mother we werent smooching
how could you do this to me
dont you realize the calibre of people
who are going to be here
calm down beatrice and let her say
i thought we would be
introducing them
to lyle van de groot not some
wild man you found in the jungle
beatrice this is supposed to be
her wedding not yours
so
beatrice i know youre upset
and so am l but we cant force her
to marry someone against her will
why not
mom dad
im ready to go out there
and apologize to everybody
and tell them what really happened
absolutely not
as far as im concerned you
you caught one of those viruses
yes one of those dreadful
jungle viruses
that get nice girls all confused
and if lyle survives that
awful jail you will simply
have to kiss and make up
as for this evening we will hold
our heads high and we will carry on
now darling where is that charming
young friend of yours
well where is he
i dont know
hes around here someplace
well find him we havent got
all day oh ursula look
oh great
how wonderful
and look at richards exquisite
figurines of you and darling lyle
george watch out for that
mom dad this is george
hello mr and mrs ursula
how do you do
it is always such a pleasure
to see you mr mayor
and you know its so nice
to get away from city hall
and be around some normal people
for a change
well we are perfectly normal
i assure you in an exceptional way
of course
of course
aand what about this guy lyle
you know id really like to meet
the man you deem good enough
to marry your daughter
oh well unfortunately lyle
is busy at the moment
uh tending to some legal affairs
some pate mr mayor
you know i never touch that stuff
oh
i had a lovely time
would you excuse us please
excuse me dr goldblum
its 730 do you know where
your jungle man is
so this is what you were doing
in the jungle clever girl
yeah um he swung me on vines
and fed me coconut milk
i knew it
hes not a real meat loaf is he
no i mean
hes not brainy
in that doctor lawyer
banker way
but he has something else
he has a
sensual intelligence
sensual intelligence
wow
oh my god
what is it with chicks
and horses huh
george how are you this evening
pretty sharp threads there
uh george right
yeah wherere you based
the jungle
i hear ya
we cut our teeth in new york also
eh you considering a position
with stanhope that could be fruitful
fruitful this place not so fruitful
nobody here have big coconuts
george
i wa oh
would you mind
stepping outside with me
thank you so much
for just a moment
sure
hello beatrice
hello ella
well we havent been friends
for very long george
but i already think i know
something about you
oh
you are in love with my daughter
oh mrs ursula not so dumb
george
my concern however is that ursula
seems to reciprocate your feelings
and that does present
a problem to me
you see
you and ursula together
would be unbefitting
her social stature
you see let me put it in a way
you might understand
where you come from
zebras marry zebras
and leopards marry leopards
stripes with stripes
spots with spots
well ursula is a stripe
and you are a spot
one which i intend to have removed
as soon as possible
so you no want ursula
to love george
i would rather have my tongue nailed to
this table every morning at breakfast
that hurt
not as much as you will
if you do anything
to screw up my daughters marriage
to lyle van de groot
when lyle returns this wedding
will proceed as planned
if you do anything to upset that
i will remove your reason
for wearing a loin cloth
steak tartare mrs stanhope
oh no no thank you
ive had quite enough protein for today
have a pleasant evening
mr jungle
tookie tookie
tookie
george so happy to see tookie
ape kidnapped
ape apenapped
george save ape
ursula
well of course he went back to the
jungle where else would go the hague
but why would he leave
without saying goodbye
well personally i think he acted
rather sensibly showed good character
he understands that he belongs there
you belong here
its really all a question
of stripes and spots
what oh no
you got to him
mother what did you say
i simply said that if he
really cared for you
hed leave you alone and let you
get on with your life and marry lyle
i am not marrying lyle mother
beatrice perhaps we should just
arthur now ursula darling
dont be ridiculous
theres a big difference
between marriageable material
and a fling in the jungle
a fling in the jungle
a fling in the jungle
who says i had
a fling in the jungle
you dont think you can
fool your mother do you
youve been head over heels for that ape
ever since you brought him here

is fleeting youll get over it
