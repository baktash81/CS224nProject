the elephant and the ape 
a place known as the bukuvu 
travellers flying overhead
can only glimpse at its many marvels 
its sparkling rivers   
its lush veldts 
its billowy cloud formations   
and its hidden mountains 
  never fear  my friends

twenty five years later 
the bouncing baby boy   
has grown into
a swinging jungle king 
he is swift  he is strong 
he is sure  he is smart 
he is unconscious 
meanwhile  43 vines away   
george s kingdom was being threatened
by a terrifying intruder 
hi  everybody  me again 
third day in mbwebwe

  banyan tree 
  banyan tree  and look what s in it

if you don t mind me saying so 
the apes   
are supposed to be a fascinating sight 
especially that white ape 
white ape  what s that 
ask mr kwame 
i bet he can tell you 
  it is only a native legend 
  could you please tell us 
the people say he is
over seven feet tall   
with the strength of a lion 
when the moon is full
and the air is sweet   
he wanders alone
through the jungle   
piercing the silence of the valley
with his mournful call 
now  some say he is
thirsty for blood 
others say he is calling
for the mate that he longs for   
but will never find 
by day  he rules the entire bukuvu
from the top of the mountain 
but by night  
he and bigfoot run the candy counter
at the bukuvu cineplex 
now playing on all 14 screens 
planet of the apes 
bigfoot  max  that d be worth
a lot more than any white  
  ursula  what are we doing here 
  lyle  i came all this way  
okay  okay 
the things i do for you 
looks like we re on  fellows 
as the sun rose
over ape mountain   
its agitated inhabitants sent an urgent
message to george by bongo gram   
warning the jungle king that
intruders were close afoot 
ooh  lyle  listen 
what was that 
could be the mating call
of the white ape 
huh  white ape 
sounds like a drink 
uh  yes  bartender  i ll have
two black russians and a white ape 
a drink the venal van de groot
would be begging to imbibe   
if he only knew how near the white ape
was at that very moment   
flying through the foliage 
surveying the scenery  cruising in   
for a closer look and swinging on
through the trees with effortless ease 
ow 
and so  onward and upward
the tired trekkers trudged   
on feverish footsies
over perilous paths 
when they finally beheld the mighty
ape mountain  they reacted with awe 
  aww 
  i said  awe   a w e 
  ooh 
  that s better 
single file on the bridge 
step very cautiously 
it is full of rotten planks 
one false move  you could fall over 
then you will have
a very long time to wave goodbye 
don t you worry  peanut 
i was on a bridge like this in maui 
it was steady as a rock 
see 
hey  s stop  stop that

inexperienced guides

y   y   u ursula 
ursu   wha  
ursula  i found your scrunchie 
go away 
it was horrible 
it was   400 pound
white ape man 
the white ape

i held him off as long as i could 
blood everywhere 
the white ape   my girlfriend 
he   he weighs 400 pounds 
the white ape got my girlfriend 
the white ape got  
help  help  man needs help 
after a night
of feverish fantasies   
the perfectly permed heiress 
ursula stanhope   
awoke to the melodious music of the
bukuvu bird life  and found herself   
venturing forth in search
of that defender of the innocent   
protector of the weak 
and all around good guy   
george of the jungle 
but that s not
who she saw first 
what 
get away  get away 
get away 
  hello  oop 
  oh  dear 
feeling better  fella 
okay  it s that dream  then 
i m still having that
psycho dream  hello 
  oh  oh 
  oh  no  no  don t worry  ape friend 
  ape make your breakfast 
  what does it want 
what does it want 
 it  wants its physician s
desk reference  if you don t mind 
unless you d rather die
of dengue fever  of course 
that is very funny 
i thought i heard
the monkey talk 
but that is totally
understandable  right 
i mean  why wouldn t
an ape read textbooks 
and why wouldn t i find
myself in a tree house   
with room service and a tarzan wannabe 
wearing a  um  um  
  what do you call that thing 
  butt flap 
right 
ohh  
ooh 
bit of a shock  i suppose  yes 
fever 
cold compress  dab her lightly  george 
 talking monkey  
that s the ticket  good 
huh  somethin  funny
about this fella 
she s not a  fella   george  she s
a woman  the female of your species 
you mean ape and george
not brothers 
well  in a sense 
we are related 
after all  we re both members
of the primate family 
primate family  brothers 
i suppose one might claim
that there would  
mommy  make that monkey
stop talking 
perhaps i should refrain from speaking
around her  as it seems to upset her 
  what your name 
  ursula 
ursula stanhope 
  who are you 
  george 
george primate 
and that brother ape 
ape primate 
ah  oh  um  
okay  i m gonna
pass out again now 
bye 
it s a sissy white ape 
i would ve choked the life out of him   
except that he had two of his
lion buddies jump me from behind 
so in this version 
there are two lions with the white ape 
a minute ago 
there was only one 
h hey  the important thing 
kwame  is that i was outnumbered 
absolutely 
ursula 
hi  when i woke up this morning 
i remembered about that lion   
and i know you
saved me yesterday 
  and i just wanted to say thank you 
  ah 
ooh 
now that i m feeling better 
i realize the others must think
i m cat food by now 
and i don t want my fian  
this guy that i was with   to worry 
so  so i should probably go
and look for them   
and i was wondering
if you could help me 
uh   ursula want to go already 
okay  george help 
get trusty doggy 
oh  you have a dog 
that s great 
doggy will help find friends 
george call shep

  wow

ungawa  shep 
and so  with the help
of the jungle king s big  grey   
peanut loving poochie 
george and ursula set out   
on a desperate search to find
her fianc   uh  that guy she was with  
lyle  lyle 
  ursula  ursula 
  while he desperately
searched for her 
but by the end of the afternoon
her desperation had dimmed   
that was fantastic 
and she had given up
all hope of everything   
except enjoying the jungle king s
company from her precarious perch
atop his faithful doggy 
  so  where are we going now 
  to find tookie tookie bird

and expensive waterfall set   
ursula was amazed that she was lost
in the wilderness with a jungle man

swimming blindly to throw
myself upon your shore

hoping for a miracle
i ve been waiting day and night
day and night
i ve been waiting for you all my life
waiting for redemption
i ve been waiting day and night
i burn for you
and so it came to pass
that george of the jungle   
attended his first co ed dance 
but his rapturous rendezvous with the
urban heiress was to be short lived   
as the very next morning  kwame and
his men were drawing dangerously close 
that is  dangerously close to shoving
a coconut up lyle s sleeping bag 
that s it  i ve had it 
i am the richest  smartest  handsomest
guy here  so i get to go first 
there s an elephant around here 
bad guy falls in poop 
classical element of physical comedy 
now comes the part where we throw
our heads back and laugh  ready 
ready 
those were nowhere near
properly digested 
in case anybody s
wondering  i m okay 
have you cleaned my lighter yet 
come on  come on 
that was ursula

george 
whew  okay  kids  let s settle down
and review the important information 
lyle is a big doofus 
poor george was really shot   
but can t die because 
let s face it  he s the hero 
so  the naturally concerned
and preternaturally wealthy
ursula stanhope   
whisked george off on a private jet
bound for the country of his birth   
where he would get the finest
medical treatment available 
i m gonna get you the finest
medical treatment available 
as for those pesky  pernicious
and putrid poachers  max and thor   
they awaited their fate
in the bujumbura jail 
you two  out 
  acquitted 
  no  deported 
meanwhile  kwame and his men faced
the next to impossible task   
of picking out george s assailant
from a line up of the usual suspects 
too short  too sweaty 
wait a second  that s the guy 
that s the guy who shot him 
  i never forget a face 
  me

to listen to any more of your ideas

in taking george of the jungle
to a fine haberdasher 
  and this is neiman marcus 
  whoo  they have big  shiny cave 
hello  would you like

later  in the men s department  after
discovering his long lost brothers   
the jungle king was pleased to find
he looked pretty good in armani 
pretty darn good 
watch out  man 
why everyone run around crazy 
like antelope in mating season 
they re just trying to make a living 
it s   different kind
of jungle here  george 
it s survival of the fittest 
dog eat dog 
   dog eat dog    dog eat dog here 
  no  that s not what i meant 
george never bring shep here

coincidence  and here s ours

and so  jazzed on java   
george of the jungle made his way
into the city by the bay 
whoo 
quickly taking to tourism 
the jungle king enjoyed   
the first drive through
dining of his life   
and strolled the city streets until
he found something so scintillating   
  he had to say 
  ooh 
but nothing excited
the jungle king more   
than the sight of the biggest
rope bridge he had ever seen 
ooh  yeah 
  help 
  ooh 
somebody help 
  to swing or not to swing 
  help 
swing 
as the king of the jungle
quickly calculated the angle
and velocity of his next big swing   
ursula felt like jumping
off a bridge herself 
i feel so guilty 
i don t know what i m going to do 
first thing  i suggest you tell your
father what you came here to tell him 
  hi  daddy 
  hi  honey  take a look at this 
the most remarkable thing
is happening on the bay bridge 
   where strong winds
have carried him to the bay bridge 
our own valerie devlin
is live on the scene  valerie 
thank you  terilyn

  at the bay bridge   
  help 
  where a parasailor dangles   
  helplessly  500 feet above the water 
  please  hurry up  help 
there s no word on who
this lone daredevil is 
  that s george 
  he appears to have some kind
of rope in his hand 
  he might be preparing to swing on it 
  i gotta go

hey  fella  george of jungle

   one of the most daring rescues
ever recorded live on television 
this is valerie devlin reporting
to you from under the bay bridge 
back to you  terilyn 
you know  they say the city by the bay
is the most romantic in the world   
and it looks as though
there might be a little romance
unfolding under the bay bridge 
  we ll be back in a moment 
  ohh 
meanwhile  back in the jungle

while he s still under  come on 
as the pesky poachers
grunted and groaned   
pushing and pulling
the ponderous primate along   
the trusty tookie tookie bird
was already winging to the rescue   
making a bird line
for san francisco   
where george of the jungle was trying
to give the heiress ursula   
the courage to face her parents   
by helping her discover
the juju within 
  make jungle call

  hi 
ursula stanhope went inside
to break the news to her parents 
who took it extremely well 
mother  daddy 
i love you both very much 
i have something
very important to tell you   
and i hope you ll understand 
  i don t want to marry lyle any more 
  we understand  dear 
just kidding 
  the young miss stanhope
proceeded to spill the beans   
  so  anyway  i went to the jungle  
very quickly   
until she got to
the important part at the end 
then lyle shot him  so lyle
is in jail and george is with me   
and i don t want to marry
lyle any more 
i knew it  it s that swinging man
from the bridge 
i saw you smooching on tv 
  mother  we weren t smooching  
  how could you do this to me 
don t you realize the calibre of people
who are going to be here 
  calm down  beatrice  and let her say  
  i thought we would be
introducing them   
to lyle van de groot  not some
wild man you found in the jungle 
beatrice  this is supposed to be
her wedding  not yours 
  so 
  beatrice  i know you re upset   
and so am l  but we can t force her
to marry someone against her will 
  why not 
  mom  dad 
i m ready to go out there
and apologize to everybody
and tell them what really happened 
absolutely not 
as far as i m concerned  you  
you caught one of those viruses 
yes  one of those dreadful
jungle viruses   
that get nice girls all confused 
and if lyle survives that
awful jail  you will simply
have to kiss and make up 
as for this evening  we will hold
our heads high and we will carry on 
now  darling  where is that charming
young friend of yours 
  well  where is he 
  i don t know 
he s around here someplace 
  well  find him  we haven t got
all day  oh  ursula  look 
  oh  great 
how wonderful 
and look at richard s exquisite
figurines of you and darling lyle 
george  watch out for that  
mom  dad  this is george 
hello  mr and mrs ursula 
how do you do 
it is always such a pleasure
to see you  mr mayor 
and  you know  it s so nice
to get away from city hall   
and be around some normal people
for a change 
well  we are perfectly normal 
i assure you   in an exceptional way 
of course 
of course 
a and what about this guy  lyle 
you know  i d really like to meet
the man you deem good enough
to marry your daughter 
oh  well  unfortunately lyle
is busy at the moment   
uh  tending to some legal affairs 
  some pate  mr mayor 
  you know  i never touch that stuff 
  oh 
  i had a lovely time 
  would you excuse us  please 
  excuse me  dr goldblum 
it s 7 30  do you know where
your jungle man is 
so this is what you were doing
in the jungle  clever girl 
yeah  um  he swung me on vines
and fed me coconut milk 
  i knew it 
  he s not a real meat loaf  is he 
no  i mean 
he s not brainy   
in that doctor  lawyer 
banker way   
but he has something else 
  he has a  
  sensual intelligence 
 sensual intelligence  
  wow 
  oh  my god 
what is it with chicks
and horses  huh 
george  how are you this evening 
pretty sharp threads there 
uh   george  right 
  yeah  where re you based 
  the jungle 
i hear ya 
we cut our teeth in new york also 
eh  you considering a position
with stanhope  that could be fruitful 
fruitful  this place not so fruitful 
nobody here have big coconuts 
george 
i wa   oh 
would you mind
stepping outside with me  
thank you so much  
for just a moment 
sure 
  hello  beatrice 
  hello  ella 
well  we haven t been friends
for very long  george   
but i already think i know
something about you 
  oh 
  you are in love with my daughter 
  oh  mrs ursula not so dumb 
  george 
my concern  however  is that ursula
seems to reciprocate your feelings   
and that does present
a problem to me 
you see 
you and ursula together   
would be unbefitting
her social stature 
you see  let me put it in a way
you might understand 
where you come from   
zebras marry zebras
and leopards marry leopards 
stripes with stripes 
spots with spots 
well  ursula is a stripe
and you are a spot   
one which i intend to have removed
as soon as possible 
so you no want ursula
to love george 
i would rather have my tongue nailed to
this table every morning at breakfast 
  that hurt 
  not as much as you will
if you do anything   
to screw up my daughter s marriage
to lyle van de groot 
when lyle returns  this wedding
will proceed as planned 
if you do anything to upset that   
i will remove your reason
for wearing a loin cloth 
steak tartare  mrs stanhope 
oh  no  no  thank you 
i ve had quite enough protein for today 
have a pleasant evening 
mr jungle 
tookie  tookie 
tookie 
george so happy to see tookie 
ape kidnapped 
ape ape napped 
george save ape 
ursula 
well  of course he went back to the
jungle  where else would go   the hague 
but why would he leave
without saying goodbye 
well  personally i think he acted
rather sensibly  showed good character 
he understands that he belongs there 
you belong here 
it s really all a question
of stripes and spots 
what  oh  no 
you got to him 
mother  what did you say 
i simply said that if he
really cared for you   
he d leave you alone and let you
get on with your life and marry lyle 
  i am not marrying lyle  mother 
  beatrice  perhaps we should just  
arthur  now  ursula darling 
don t be ridiculous 
there s a big difference
between marriageable material
and a fling in the jungle 
 a fling in the jungle  
 a fling in the jungle  
who says i had
a fling in the jungle 
you don t think you can
fool your mother  do you 
you ve been head over heels for that ape
ever since you brought him here 
now  ursula  that kind of love
is fleeting  you ll get over it 
  did you just say  love  
  no 
  you did 
  ursula 
  you re right 
  don t say it 
  i love him  i m outta here 
ursula  you can t love him 
arthur  say something 
  be careful out there  honey 
  what 
  goodbye  daddy 
  i love you 
  wha  
  i love you  mom  thank you 
  ursula   arthur  do something 
  what would you have me do 
  there s obviously no stopping her 
  oh  god 
  ursula 
  god  that woman s a pain in the ass 
meanwhile 
halfway across the world   
another ass was feeling pain   
as an ape named ape
was caged in a cage   
hoping to hear
the jungle king s awesome  
hey  i m pretty good at that  
and wondering
if he would ever come 
but the motion sick mammal
needn t have moaned   
for that defender of the innocent 
protector of the weak   
and all around good guy
george of the jungle   
was closer than he knew
