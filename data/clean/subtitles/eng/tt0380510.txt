there was a snow globe 
and i remember the penguin
who lived inside the globe 
he was all alone in there
and  i worried for him 
don t worry  kiddo   
he has a nice life 
he s trapped in a perfect world 
look at that  susie q 
i remember being given a camera
for my birthday 
i loved the way a photo
could capture a moment   
before it was gone 
that s what i wanted to be
when i grew up  
  a  wild life photographer 
sorry  mom 
i imagined that when i was older 
i d be tracking wild elephants and rhinos 
but  for now  i d have to
make do with grace tarking 
it s strange  the memories you keep 
i remember going with dad
to the sink hole out at the connor s farm 
there was something about the way
the earth could swallow things whole 
and i remember the girl who lived there 
ruth connors 
the kids at our school said
she was weird 
and now i know she
saw things other didn t 
ready 
one  two  three 
and i remember the worst thing
that ever happened to us as a family 
somebody help 
  mom 
where are you 
mom 
oh god 
dad 
the day my little brother
stopped breathing 
buckley 
what happened 
  he swallowed a twig 
watch out 
are you crazy 
  sorry 
buckley 
you re okay   
and i remember the light in my
parents eyes  the relief 
we weren t those people   
    those unlucky people  to whom
bad things happened for no reason 
you know the buddhists say 
 if you save someone else s life    
grandma lynn predicted i would live a long
and happy life  because i d saved my brother 
as usual 
grandma lynn was wrong 
my name is salmon  like the fish 
first name  susie 
i was 14 years old when i was murdered 
on december 6  1973 
 announcer  over here next  we have crystal   
this was before missing kids
started appearing on milk cartons 
or were feature stories
on the daily news 
it was back when people
believed things like that didn t happen 
that s right ladies  no matter the size 
it ll hug your girly girl curves
in all the right places   
if you got it  why not flaunt it   
  hold on  buddy 
buckley 
  dad  look look look 
there it is 
who is he 
does he like you as much as you like him 
grandma  he s a senior 
he doesn t know i exist 
  he s cute 
  grandma  please just drop it 
you re safe now 
he s gone into the record store 
i wasn t safe  a man in my
neighborhood was watching me 
if i hadn t been so distracted 
i would have realized something was wrong 
cause that sort of thing gives me the
skeevies   
but i was too busy  thinking about
the length of ray singh s eyelashes 
i counted each one in library time
while he was reading  abelard and heloise 
the most seriously tragic love story
ever 
so  have you kissed him yet 
why not  you like him  he likes you 
what s the hold up 
i m just afraid i won t be any good at it 
my first kiss was with grown man 
you not going to tell on me  are you 
  of course not 
  what was it like 
  the kiss  oh it was wonderful 
beautiful  glorious 
took me a long time before i realized that
a kiss like that  it only happen just once 
susie   
just have fun  kid 
it wasn t mr  o dwyer  by the way 
although  he does look kinda suspicious 
mr  o dwyer never hurt anyone 
mr  o dwyer s own daughter died
a year and a half after i did 
she had leukemia 
but i never saw her in my heaven 
hey  look at me

neighborhood

closet scale modeller

of some kind of structure 
and susie 
we didn t find her  mrs  salmon 
that s good  isn t it 
i mean  you found susie s hat  but you didn t

  how are you doing 
do you have some time for few question  
  certainly 
come in 
  thanks 
i know why you re here  of course
i think when something like this happens   
you always blame yourself 
all i can think about it now is 
why i didn t see something 
or why i didn t hear something because 
   because surely  that young girl
must have screamed 
did you want one 
  no  no thanks 
but if you could just think back  i mean she
was wearing a blue jacket  yellow corduroys   
similar clothes to these 
this blue jacket here 
  the darker blue jacket 
and on the second photograph you can see
the pants she wore 
no  it does not ring a bell 
but you were home that day 
what day 
  last wednesday

oh yeah  all this   i turn all the banisters
myself  make all the shingles and the furniture   
i used to do cabinet making  but there s
not much call for that these days 
maybe i spend too much time on these things 
but that s the perfectionist in me  i guess 
all it shows 
  thank you 
  that s amazing craftsmanship 
  oh  well   
i took a risk and tried something new  and
discovered a talent that i didn t know i had 
what s that underneath the stairs 
  that would be the basement 
dad 
she s dead  isn t she 
i was slipping away  
that s what it felt like 
life was leaving me 
but i wasn t afraid 
then i remembered  there was something
i was meant to do 
somewhere i was meant to be 
ray 
ray 
ray 
ray  wait 
ray

  that s where we re going 
holly said there was a wide  wide heaven

dad 
my murderer began to feel safe 
he knew people wanted to move on 
they needed to forget 
he took comfort in the thought
no one was looking at him 
but there was one thing my murderer
didn t understand 
he didn t understand how much a father
could love his child 
dad

he knows i m here 
my dad knows i m here 
i was still with him 
i wasn t lost  or frozen  or gone 
i was alive 
i was alive in my own perfect world 
dad 
i saw susie 
she came into my room 
she kissed me on the cheek 
come here buddy 
i saw her too 
dad  i think she listens 
she s used up all the film
we gave her for her birthday 
  all of it 
it is a crime to be creative in this family 
  shall we pay for one roll a month 
one roll a month 
i got  em 
look at these   some of these are good 
honey  why don t you get them all developed 
this  one roll a month  thing is

thing dragging out like this 
we are not dragging it out 
we made a deal 
there is no deal  jack 
fenerman
len  i had to call you 
look  susie is smart kid 
she would never go off with a stranger 
it had to be someone she knew 
somebody local 
look  i ve got a name for you 
i ve got several names actually 
ronald driver 
  do you have an address 
len i ve got another name for you 
he s a janitor  michael gitchell

i ve been up to the public records office 
a lot of stuff to go over here   
i know you re looking at the obvious suspects  
convicted felons  child molesters 
and i understand why  but len   
i think you re coming at it
from the wrong angle 
honey 
  herman stolefis  just across the street   
now he appears to be perfectly normal  but len   
the man wears adults diapers 
herman is 80 years old 
  i followed him to the supermarket 
his shopping cart was filled with them 
  he has a prostate problem 
my point is   we need to stop looking backward 
we need to start looking at family histories 
criminal records  mental health issues   
  jack  this doesn t change anything 
did i mention taxes  len  you can tell
a lot about a person from taxes 
please will you just stop it now 
will you just stop 
can t you just leave it alone 
jack  i know it s been 11 months  i know you ve
been trying to deal with this in your own way
but   
she s not coping very well 
she needs help  jack 
she needs someone to help her
get through this 
grandma is here  grandma 
grandma is here 
what s my mother here 
  look  you re not coping  ok 
len s worried  i m worried 
your mother offered to help 
you invited her here 
  darling 
hello  mother 
  look at you  are you eating 
is this all of it 
  don t be ridiculous  that s just my make up 
oh  you re as handsome as hell  jack 
  lindsey  honey  are you going to say hello 
the child hates me 
so  what will it be  jack 
actually  i m not drinking these days 
  ah  that s your problem in a nutshell 
are we still a family 
  of course we re a family 
your mother s in crisis 
your father s a wreck 
what does that make you 
i m in charge 
he walked through the woods  looking
for rabbits 
then he sees three  he grabs his gun 
looks and aims 
and then  a giant puff of smoke  
he doesn t see them any more   
then he realizes that his gun 
it was out of bullets  then he runs 
you re the salmon girl  right 
ok     o k 
holiday 
grandma  i know where susie is 
yeah  susie is gone to heaven  sweetheart 
  lindsey said there is no heaven 
alright then  she s dead 
you might be dead soon 
  why do you say that 
because you re old 
35 is not old  you ve been sniffing
too much of that polish 
and anyway  nothing s going to happen to me 
you know why 
because i take my medicine  everyday 
grandma  she s here 
what 
  susie 
susie s in the in between 
i was in the blue horizon  between
heaven and earth 
the days were unchanging 
and every night  i dreamed
the same dream 
the smell of damp earth 
the scream that no one heard 
the sound of my heart beating 
like a hammer against cloth 
and i would hear them calling 
the voices of the dead 
i wanted to follow them 
to find a way out 
but i would always come back
to the same door 
and i was afraid 
i knew if i went in there   
i would never come out 
my murderer could live in
one moment for a long time 
he could feed off the memory
over  and over again 
he was animal 
faceless 
infinite 
but then he would feel it 
the emptiness returning 
and the need would
rise in him again 
go 
  here in 
when summer came  he noticed young
lovers would sneak into the cornfield 
he began to follow them  and watch 
will you come to bed 
yeah  soon 
ohh  buckley did this  right 
  correct  he said that this is our house   
this is the police station  and that s you 
  that s me 
mmm hmm 
yeah  he made you chief of police  so   
  i ve gained 20 pounds 
that must be  uh   the uniform 
  the dangers of a desk job 
why don t you have a seat   
i m living with this every day 
  what about your marriage 
what marriage  
jack is sleeping in the study 
you have to find a way to keep going 
  mother 
you don t have a choice 
  i am coping with this 
if you can t give up  you have to   
ah  bingo 
that is cooking sherry  please   please 
  you have to find a way to live with this

i am dealing  i m coping 
i m dealing with it  so what 
you have a tomb in the middle of your
house 
oh sweetheart  do you really think if you
seal it up  that the pain s gonna go away 
my mother went as far away as she could 
she found a job at a small orchard
outside of santa rosa 
the work was hard  but
she didn t mind 
if anyone asked  she said
she had two children 
dearest lindsey   
and lindsey  who always said
she didn t believe in love   
found it anyway 
and there it was  the moment
i would never have 
my little sister had run ahead of me 
she was growing up 
what s the matter 
i thought you d be happy 
i am happy 
i m very happy 
why are you crying 
no   you think she did not want to kiss him 
  no  she did 
she wanted to kiss him very much 
always  i would watch ray 
i was in the air around him 
i was in the cold winter mornings
he spent with ruth conners 
that strange  other worldly girl   
who so easily accepted the presence
of the dead among the living 
and sometimes  ray would think of me 
but he began to wonder  maybe it was
time to put that memory away 
maybe it was time to let me go 
lindsey  throw it 
missing girl  susie salmon and
sister lindsey salmon  right 
my murderer had finely tuned instincts 
he knew my sister had begun to wonder about
the solitary man who lived in the green house 
she seemed intent on crowding him 
and he resented it 
he began to feel a familiar itch 
mom  look 
  just a second 
careful  honey 
  mom 
really  that is a beautiful smell   
mom  look 
hey dad  look at me 
oh   mr  salmon  hi

  oh  it s just a project i m working on 
you re a hunter 
  ducks 
that s a blind right 
yeah 
  so those things really work 
oh yeah 
it s all about concealment 
the art of concealment 
and patience  takes a lot of patience 
sit for hours on end in the dark 
i m an outdoors man

mr  salmon

your father put a hole in the man s back door

this is the example you re setting for your kids 
persecuting the neighbors 
  he is not crazy 
i didn t say that 
  well then why won t you listen to him 
because you need evidence  lindsey 
you can t go around  making accusations against
george harvey when you have no evidence

that had grown around my absence
