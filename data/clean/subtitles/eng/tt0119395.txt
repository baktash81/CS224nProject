yet while jubilation
at the prospect of freedom
the russian mafia has evolved into
a worldclass organized crime network
with profits in billions
including substantial us operations
announcing the unprecedented opening
of an fbi legal attache
along with the firstever joint us
and russian law enforcement operation
its her
ghazzis in the club hes in position
okay ops a go mvd only
what is this an american
who the fuck are you
deputy director carter preston fbi
fbi
you fuck americans now
you ugly militia whore
and you go fuck yourself
this is not chicago this is russia

and get the fuck out of here

i swear i will kill you
and your fucking whore mothers
i repeat you are advised
fuck you you scarfaced cunt

all right thats enough
its never easy taking a life
but you saved one too mine
thank you
we had no warning
they must have ambushed
our man outside
before we knew it there were militia with
their guns out in every corner of the room
they just opened fire and killed him
it happened so fast it was
over before it started
god my poor brother
how many militia did you kill
terek please we didnt stand a chance
there were 30 of them
plus the americans
yes but how many did you kill
well none
none not even one
terek please
i did what i could
you did what you could
you let those militia pigs
and that american scum kill my brother
without killing one in return
okay thats what you could do
heres what i can do
i loved this man like a brother
he was a dear friend and partner to me
so i took no joy in that
but just think
if i could do this to one i love
what could i do to someone i hate
the american fbi declares war on us
then war it is
unlike other less cunning predators
the hyena takes no chances
never attacking unless sure of a kill
though a consummate killer
he is clearly no gentleman
i apologize for keeping you waiting
i had some other business to dispose of
so much wasted time
confusing motion with accomplishment
another drink
the mvd killed my brother
for that i will see they drown in blood
but to their allies in america
i wish to send a message
a very public message
i want to strike fear
into the marrow of their bones
can you kill this person
yes
if i take this job ill have to disappear
forever
so if you want me to do this
youre going to have to pay me
how much
american dollars
all cash of course
half now half upon completion
70 million
why not
done
how many people know about this
you and i
keep it that way
dont refer to our arrangement
by telephone or fax ever
you should find a place outside of russia
to hide until the missions completed
if word of this leaks itll be my choice
whether to continue or not
either way i keep the initial payment
agreed
okay

tereks planning something more dramatic

were spotted in the town of porvoo
60 kilometers west of helsinki
theyre still there taking the third floor
for themselves and their bodyguards
all former spetsnaz nine in all
not ones left the building in five days
their only contact with the outside
is this man victor politovsky
he goes to the post office twice a day
for mail which arrives general delivery
contact interpol
and get everything you can on politovsky
tereks men are notoriously hard to
turn out should we get the opportunity
we must be prepared to conduct
the interrogation with utmost efficiency

several assassinations
are credited to him
but weve never been able to prove
if he even exists
from time to time he was kgb asset

payments were made to the contracting
organization or a hong kong bank account

russian embassy
theyll have daily progress reports
900 pm every evening this office
major koslova anything else
since 1983 kgb provided funding
for five directaction missions
one bombing and four assassinations
by gunshot
the jackal was the operative used
not giving me much to work with preston
we dont have much sir
major koslovas informers cant finger him
they dont know who he is
cia cant track him
then what
using kgb files
ive identified six operatives
we believe to have actually seen him
four are dead one in libya but the last
is believed to be in the united states
a basque separatist
name isabella celia zancona
she might know what he looks like
but we have no idea of her whereabouts
someone must
interpol says that in the 80s
she was involved with
declan joseph mulqueen
an ira sharpshooter
he burned out they decided to get him
out of ireland shipped him here
in 89 he picked up twice 25 years
for some old weapons trafficking charges
hes serving time at a maximumsecurity
state pen in massachusetts
say he does know where she is
what makes you think hell talk to you
im hoping hell cooperate
for a reduced sentence
dont promise too much
after all hes a terrorist
you got some visitors mulqueen
what do you want with isabella
shes done nothing here
she entered the country illegally
what the fbis sending
deputy directors out after illegal aliens
give over preston
who you really looking for
a pro calls himself the jackal
that fellow
the mystery man
we think she may be able
to help us find him
if so well arrange a pardon for her
signed by the president of the us
and guarantee no extradition wed also
guarantee the spanish government
will never know her whereabouts
they dont know now do they
and neither do you
lets keep it that way
would it matter that you might be
saving a human life
and whose human life
would be important enough for all this
mr donald brown director of the fbi
wouldnt that be droll
we know that gang elements
in this prison want you dead
the entire government
wants me dead mister
yet here i am
all right smart ass lets cut the bullshit
you cooperate and well get you
transferred to a minimumsecurity facility
thats our deal
and thats your only chance
to walk out of this place in one piece
thats a onetime offer
now take it or leave it
stuff it then
as many fucking times as you like
pardon the language ive been in prison
all right what will it take
for you to help us
first id have to be convinced
isabella would be kept safe
done
then youd have to let me go
back to ireland a free man
out of the question
besides gunrunning youre a known killer
of british government personnel
and all the women
and children youve blown up
its not my war i was never a bomber
i dont see the distinction
you still took human lives
the distinction is i killed in a war
now i want to go home simple as that
simple for you perhaps
even in russia soldiers go home
when the treatys signed nyet
thats not gonna happen sorry
all right just the chance then
your best efforts to get me free
ill settle for your word on it
sorry
so the jackals after your director is he
tell him to get his affairs in order
because nobody can save him now
nobody except me because i met him
yeah didnt i mention it
i can identify him by his face
given the opportunity
but more importantly by his methods
so you can leave isabella out of this
did you work with him
with him no no way
do you have a problem with this man
thats between him and me
isabella zancona
is the only confirmed contact we have
and we will find her
with or without your help
okay
i want three things
one get me out of here
im no use to you sitting here on my ass
whats to keep you from taking off
nothing
except i give you my word
two i go with you to meet isabella
why
i want to see her is all
and the third thing
a decent razor
heres how itll go mulqueen
you will be searched on a random
schedule if we turn up a paper clip
that hasnt been authorized ill send
you back same for using the phone
what you dont trust me
as far as i can throw you
but i have little choice
if youve got any thoughts
about an ira snatch
well shoot to kill them and you
and not necessarily in that order
understand
i heard you
go along and well get along
im gonna keep a real good eye on you
miss koslova is it
what would your first name be then
major
major koslova
a wee bit rusty thats all
subassembly of titanium
as light as the stresses will allow
the arms got to traverse 270 degrees
feed and drive mechanisms
run on 210 amp servos
the whole things has to run off 12volt dc
yeah its a car battery thats cool
how much weight is the arm supporting
fiftyfive kilograms
its a big fucker yeah
hey you want one
no
im gonna want this in eight days
i can do that
how much
well the titaniums gonna be a problem
its a listed material up here
its gonna take time a little more money
i mean like 40000
all right half now half on delivery
this suckers definitely
gonna kick some ass yeah
get this straight
when you finish this unit youll turn over
the plans and scrap material
youll forget about charlie murdock
and the tech specs on these plans
shit man im cool
relax
all right
are you nervous
eight years thats a lifetime isnt it
hello
mr decker is it
yes
hello there im declan mulqueen
this is major koslova
how do you do
hi
wed like to speak to your wife
someone to see you
ill take the kids out back
my beautiful irish
they let me out to ask you something
sir i was thinking maybe we could
use the zancona woman as insurance
in case mulqueen gets happy feet
listen
however he plays it we play it straight
isabella zanconas involvement
remains classified
that means nothing in the report
no name no location nothing got it
yes sir
i never knew his name
but he was definitely american
he had some kind
of special military training
where he learned spanish
in el salvador i think
i didnt like talking to him
i suppose we were all dangerous people
but he was different
declan was fire all passion
he had a cause
this man was ice no feeling nothing
okay thank you mrs decker
youve been very helpful
its best if you keep our conversation
confidential even from your husband
dont worry about george
he doesnt know anything
about my past and he doesnt want to
all he needs to know is that i love him
i see
i thank you again
ill wait for you in the car
this opens a locker
at norfolk greyhound terminal
inside is a clean passport and 10000 cash
your friends left it with me
in case you ever showed up
take it and go back to ireland
i cant
what
you gave your word
go now
once he kills whoever hes after
theyll send you back to prison
when i believe that ill use the key
are you happy at least
yes i love my children
and my husband in my way i mean
some nights i can close my eyes
and sleep
and no dead faces come to wake me
thats more than i ever had
you wouldnt have me give that up
would you
give me some credit will you
shes basque isnt she
aye
they say basques live by the vendetta
if they hate someone its to the death
its the same way when they love
my first name is valentina
you have family in russia
my parents my brother in the navy
husband kids
no i have not found the time
in truth its never been a conflict for me
this is not a quality
a man looks for in a woman
by the way
whatever isabella gave you after i left
i trust you wont use it
until after our business is concluded
dont miss a thing do you
no mr mulqueen
i see everything
maybe we should start
by canceling your public appearances
no i dont think thats necessary
i mean not yet
this fellows gonna need to
make preparations hell need time
how tight are the borders
mexico and canada have
mr mulqueen
something youd like to share
hell likely be using four false identities
three will be on him and one
in reserve at a drop box somewhere
thats the way he used to operate
what matter if he has 40
its still one man might we not
be creating a storm in a tea cup
exactly i agree with you 100 percent
director bolitonov
terek has always made
doing his own killing a point of honor
usually very bloody and very public
a statement if you will
so if hes hired an outsider
obviously this is something
he takes very seriously
until this jackal is captured or killed
i dont think we can afford to do any less
come on lets get real here its one guy
its just one guy bolitonovs right
with the assets in this room
the guys as good as got
thats if he doesnt blow it first
like a lot of these clowns
remember that guy what was his name
whats that mr mulqueen
im sorry mr brown
but this man is no clown
he knows all your moves back to front
right now you got a name
thats all you got
the jackals got a target you
hes got a timetable
as to making mistakes hes spent 20 years
in a trade that doesnt forgive error
and hes prevailed
you think hes the one
who is up against us
its the other way around
hi
hi
can i buy you a drink
yeah
i think you should come home with me
id love to
but i cant
i have to go back to atlanta
to finalize my very messy divorce
does she know
she does now
so how am i gonna see you again
you could give me one of your cards
youre not gonna call
douglas
you just have to have
a little faith in people thats all
like i do
open your shirt
easy now easy
now
easy
open your shirt
easy now
souvenirs of british hospitality
i apologize
no problem
oslo travel came up with a james william
hayslip who flew from toronto
august 25 two days before
the meeting with terek
we checked the social security number
on his passport and guess what
it belongs to an inmate committed to a
mental institution in virginia 12 years ago
now canadian travel says he flew
to montreal nine days ago
hello
hello
yeah
yeah charlie murdock
picking up a delivery eh
invoice
yes
its a hot one eh
you can say that again
hi i need to use one of your computers
sure any one
can i get on line with this
yeah sure
go check upstairs
thank you
hayslips disappeared
border patrol has the passport photo
but nothings shown up yet
hes moved on i told you
one moment
the only place were sure
hes been is montreal
what if he started using
the next identity there
im not following you
hayslip disappeared
that doesnt mean the jackal did
perhaps something has happened
witherspoon have the montreal police
check their logs for the last 48 hours
if hes on to the next name
its because its in the plan
a man like this doesnt make mistakes
no
they always make one somewhere
isnt that how you were caught
whats her story then
major koslova
ends the debate about
women in combat as far as im concerned
hows that
when she saved my life
and took out tereks brother
she did it knowing shed be drawing
a death sentence down on her own neck
but when we offered to set her up
someplace else when this is over
you know what she said
the good guys dont hide
fierce woman
in that country under that system
staggering
oh shit you know what
i couldnt get titanium
so i had a friend mold the base
out of carbon fiber instead
came in 23 kilos
under the weight you asked for
is that cool
yeah thats great
im still gonna want the plans the mold
and the scrap material remember
yeah
maybe we ought to talk about that
oh
this rig i figure its to support
something pretty heavy right
like a gatling gun maybe
or a 20millimeter cannon
you must be shooting
at something pretty big
armored car maybe
bank vault
i dont know you could be shooting
a fucking airliner for all i know
but the point is
a job like this
can attract a lot of attention
i dont want any attention
right right thats why im saying
i think the plans
and mold are worth a little bonus
how much
i dont know
come on man you know its worth it
you got a serious piece of equipment
all right
ill get you 50000 tomorrow
im gonna need a place to test this
someplace that wont draw any attention
we got a place like that
we got a place just like that
targets in place
man i should have brought some beer
motherfuckin motherfucker
that motherfucker is state of the art
i knew it was gonna be big i didnt know
it was gonna be the prototype cannon
its a fucking mole
some hairyiooking rounds
made from depleted uranium
itll go through anything
once they get inside they just spall
hell yeah they spall
they get in there and they just
that rocks
look at the lens on that thing
dont touch that
its got like a 2000mile zoom lens
that thing is kickass
dude is this thing a prototype or what
i bet you it cost you a shitload
that rocks
man you rock
do you know what im saying
rock
fucking thing kicks ass
bring on the spall baby
i cant wait to see the fuck
lamont
close your mouth
smooth action yeah
ready
yeah spall
well at least
it took out the target
no its off
by at least three millimeters
no dude thats precision craftsmanship
it isnt off by three millimeters
so lamont
tell me how you sight
in this thing automatically
punch in the windage and
the elevation you want and hit enter
so you just kind of guestimate it huh
basically guestimation
and hit enter
i give up
i guess the automatic sighting works
yeah
i thought i was about to sprawl
well lamont
gonna have to speedtest it now
speed test
so run
what do you mean
i mean run now
run to your right
get up
all right good stop there
just stop there
turn around
hold out that pack of cigarettes
dont be afraid
stand very still
stand still
i told you it was off
move over by the car
quick before you pass out
here we go sir major mac
eleven days ago charles c murdock
bought himself a new dodge minivan
that was a big surprise to mr murdock
whose passport and wallet were stolen
16 days ago at the helsinki airport
anything from the border

from here to manitoba
i have something uphall station
its a small town outside ottawa

lets go
the owner is lan lamont smalltime hood
the coroner has whats left of him
at broxburn
we get the idea lets get to the shop
hello think i got something here
what is it
this is a remote firing station
see it maneuvers a weapon
the servos run off a remote control
like a model airplane
we used to make these things
for mortars or
such but nothing like this size
he needs a van just to move it around
what would something this size
be used for
antiaircraft
no you can buy a mount for that
a missiles the best thing for an aircraft
no this is for something else entirely
something with one hell of a range
not just the range though
see if it is a gun its the cyclic rate
you can send off a hundred bullets
before the first one ever hits the target
good thing about a boat like this
is it sells itself
its a hell of a lot of boat for the money
its got radar
gps autopilot autofurling
you can take this baby out by yourself
this has even got a cellular phone
you can call your wife if you want to

do you have a gun
following a lowlight helicopter insertion
a team could infiltrate the weapon here
covering the northern approaches
and route 1
if your weapon has nearly the range
and cyclic rate youre advertising
it could engage
any ground vehicle and aircraft
he doesnt have a helicopter
or a team to help him set up
hes alone
what do you say mulqueen
well the only way he can make
the kill and escape is from a distance
so we make sure youre
always secure indoors
with a perimeter of men
outside your location
and pick our battles
exactly
tying a noose if you like
when he makes his move
we tighten the noose and we hang him
not exactly foolproof i know
but its the best we got
the best weve got

if you see him do not to approach him
but notify authorities immediately
you know when i first moved here
i realized i was living
in someone elses house
and thats a huge burden
youre invited
to live in the white house for four years
you feel like a renter in a sense
most definitely
with a lease thats renewable or
john f kennedy said once that if
somebody wanted to kill a public official
they can get away with it
if theyre willing to pay the price
its impossible to provide
100 percent safety would you agree
certainly
there is no way around that
but hopefully
there arent that many people
who are willing to do that
what
do you remember valentina said
a statement public and brutal
now it always bothered me
why did he keep coming
he knew we could protect the director
especially once i got involved
but he didnt abort why
it didnt come together until
i remembered what he said to valentina
tell declan he cant protect his women
wasnt he referring to isabella
no any woman all women
but remember public and brutal
were guarding the wrong person
hes after the first lady
ladies and gentlemen welcome
im sure youre as happy
as i am to be here today
its been a lot of hard work for a lot of us
but here we are
and were about to celebrate
and now it gives me great pleasure
to introduce the surgeon general
of the united states
madam chairperson
ladies and gentlemen
id like to chat with you today
about the family
shes already on the stage
secret service wants to know
whats going on
tell them
no theyll try to get her off the stage
if they do that
hell shoot off into the crowd
weve worked long and hard
to reach our goal
and i must say that we have
accomplished what we set out to do
since we first began
with a seed of an idea
it took many long and hard hours to
get the word
looking for a dark brown minivan
and anything else thats out of place
the only minivan we found
is this red one here
i checked it out
they got a local parking permit
dc tags
we can check it out again if you want
its probably one of those saferthansorry
circlejerk type deals
ill see you
you guys be safe
secret service says
the search came out negative
theyre on alert
but shes going to the podium
guess its on us
youll need a gun
forget the laser youll have to walk me
through the optics on this thing
i havent shot a gun in a while
i can see by the warm
and friendly faces out there
that this christening
has been long anticipated
thanks to all of you
who made this dream possible
weve worked long and hard
to reach our goal
and i must say that we certainly have
accomplished what we set out to do
its proof that when we set out
to reach new heights it can be done
go clear
go clear
im going for the first lady
youre cleared to shoot
on the weapon or the shooter
ladies and gentlemen
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce the first lady
of the united states
its a beautiful day
for the beginning of new hope
all right go
give me the gun
so thats how he plans to get out
the phone give me your phone
but also right now
there are police officers
risking their very lives
to help kids stay out of trouble
and off drugs
but also right now
there are dedicated teachers
preparing lessons for a new days class
