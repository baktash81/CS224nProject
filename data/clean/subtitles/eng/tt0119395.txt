yet while jubilation
at the prospect of freedom   
the russian mafia has evolved into
a world class organized crime network   
   with profits in billions 
including substantial us operations 
   announcing the unprecedented opening
of an fbi legal attache   
   along with the first ever joint us
and russian law enforcement operation 
it s her 
ghazzi s in the club  he s in position 
okay  op s a go  mvd only 
what is this  an american 
who the fuck are you 
deputy director carter preston  fbi 
fbi 
you fuck americans now 
you ugly militia whore 
and  you  go fuck yourself 
this is not chicago  this is russia 
so take your bitch
and get the fuck out of here 
do you think i m afraid of the mvd 
i swear i will kill you
and your fucking whore mothers 
i repeat  you are advised   
fuck you  you scar faced cunt 
  fuck you 
  all right  that s enough 
it s never easy taking a life 
but you saved one  too  mine 
thank you 
we had no warning 
they must have ambushed
our man outside 
before we knew it  there were militia with
their guns out in every corner of the room 
they just opened fire and killed him 
it happened so fast  it was   
   over before it started 
god  my poor brother 
how many militia did you kill 
terek  please  we didn t stand a chance 
there were 30 of them   
   plus the americans 
  yes  but how many did you kill 
well  none 
none  not even one 
terek  please 
i did what i could 
you did what you could 
you let those militia pigs
and that american scum kill my brother   
   without killing one in return 
okay  that s what you could do 
here s what i can do 
i loved this man like a brother 
he was a dear friend and partner to me 
so i took no joy in that 
but just think   
   if i could do this to one i love   
   what could i do to someone i hate 
the american fbi declares war on us 
then war it is 
unlike other  less cunning predators   
   the hyena takes no chances 
never attacking unless sure of a kill 
though a consummate killer 
he is clearly no gentleman 
i apologize for keeping you waiting 
i had some other business to dispose of 
so much wasted time   
   confusing motion with accomplishment 
another drink 
the mvd killed my brother 
for that  i will see they drown in blood 
but to their allies in america 
i wish to send a message 
a very public message 
i want to strike fear
into the marrow of their bones 
can you kill this person 
yes 
if i take this job  i ll have to disappear   
   forever 
so if you want me to do this 
you re going to have to pay me 
how much 
american dollars 
all cash  of course 
half now  half upon completion 
 70 million 
why not 
done 
how many people know about this 
  you and i 
  keep it that way 
don t refer to our arrangement
by telephone or fax  ever 
you should find a place outside of russia
to hide until the mission s completed 
if word of this leaks  it ll be my choice
whether to continue or not 
either way  i keep the initial payment 
agreed 
okay 
informants tell us terek s put bounties
on all mvd and fbi personnel 
deputy director preston
and i have special bounties on our lives 
in two weeks 
seven mvd operatives have been killed 
  we know we re getting to him 
  informants say this is just the start 
terek s planning something more dramatic 
eight days ago   
   terek and his lieutenants
were spotted in the town of porvoo   
   60 kilometers west of helsinki 
they re still there  taking the third floor
for themselves and their bodyguards   
   all former spetsnaz  nine in all 
not one s left the building in five days 
their only contact with the outside
is this man  victor politovsky 
he goes to the post office twice a day
for mail which arrives general delivery 
contact interpol
and get everything you can on politovsky 
terek s men are notoriously hard to
turn out  should we get the opportunity   
   we must be prepared to conduct
the interrogation with utmost efficiency 
  good day to you  mr  preston 
  sir 
i don t think
i want to know what that means 
the new lamination s the tricky part 
you got to use ethyl acetone 
nasty stuff  gives you liver cancer 
and i use a disk drive
to erase the magnetic strip 
  it s perfect

 jackal  what jackal 
it doesn t make sense  
 what are they planning  
 who are you  
 you fucking jackal  
 why you hanging around  revive him  
jesus 
drug assisted interrogation is
perfectly legal in matters of state security 
unfortunately  mr  politovsky
had an undiagnosed heart condition 
he said   jackal  
does this mean something to you 
there s supposedly a killer for hire
who uses that name 
several assassinations
are credited to him   
   but we ve never been able to prove
if he even exists 
from time to time  he was kgb asset 
  do you have a name 
  no name 
payments were made to the contracting
organization or a hong kong bank account 
no kgb member has ever seen him 
do we know if he ever operated in the us 
no  but   
   politovsky s briefcase
contained biographical material   
   on your donald brown 
director of the fbi 
jesus christ 
this guy s going for the gold  huh 
  get him on the phone for me 
  yes  sir 
  good morning 
  good morning 
  purpose of your visit to canada 
  steelhead 
fishing 
enjoy your stay  mr  hayslip 
thank you  i will 
i ll give you a good deal on this minivan 
it s brand new  it s fully loaded 
we ve even got a six disk cd changer 
i ll need your driver s license
and credit card 
i ll check this with the manager 
  everything should be okay  mr  murdock 
  make it charlie 
  all right  charlie  see you in a second 
  take your time 
i want this op close hold  no publicity 
put a working group together 
state  cia  secret service   
   russian embassy 
they ll have daily progress reports 
9 00 p m  every evening  this office 
major koslova  anything else 
since 1983  kgb provided funding
for five direct action missions 
one bombing and four assassinations
by gunshot 
the jackal was the operative used 
not giving me much to work with  preston 
we don t have much  sir 
major koslova s informers can t finger him 
they don t know who he is 
cia can t track him 
then what 
using kgb files 
i ve identified six operatives   
   we believe to have actually seen him 
four are dead  one in libya  but the last
is believed to be in the united states 
a basque separatist
name isabella celia zancona 
she might know what he looks like 
  but we have no idea of her whereabouts 
  someone must 
interpol says that in the  80s
she was involved with   
   declan joseph mulqueen 
an ira sharpshooter 
he burned out  they decided to get him
out of ireland  shipped him here 
in  89  he picked up twice 25 years
for some old weapons trafficking charges 
he s serving time at a maximum security
state pen in massachusetts 
say he does know where she is 
what makes you think he ll talk to you 
i m hoping he ll cooperate
for a reduced sentence 
don t promise too much 
after all  he s a terrorist 
you got some visitors  mulqueen 
what do you want with isabella 
she s done nothing here 
she entered the country illegally 
what  the fbi s sending
deputy directors out after illegal aliens 
give over  preston 
who you really looking for 
a pro  calls himself  the jackal  
that fellow 
the mystery man 
we think she may be able
to help us find him 
if so  we ll arrange a pardon for her   
   signed by the president of the us 
and guarantee no extradition  we d also
guarantee the spanish government   
   will never know her whereabouts 
  they don t know now  do they 
and neither do you 
let s keep it that way 
would it matter that you might be
saving a human life 
and whose human life
would be important enough for all this 
mr  donald brown  director of the fbi 
wouldn t that be droll 
we know that gang elements
in this prison want you dead 
the entire government
wants me dead  mister 
  yet here i am 
  all right  smart ass  let s cut the bullshit 
you cooperate and we ll get you
transferred to a minimum security facility 
that s our deal 
and that s your only chance
to walk out of this place in one piece 
that s a one time offer 
now take it or leave it 
stuff it then 
as many fucking times as you like 
pardon the language  i ve been in prison 
all right  what will it take
for you to help us 
first  i d have to be convinced
isabella would be kept safe 
done 
then you d have to let me go 
back to ireland  a free man 
out of the question 
besides gunrunning  you re a known killer
of british government personnel 
and all the women
and children you ve blown up 
it s not my war  i was never a bomber 
i don t see the distinction 
you still took human lives 
the distinction is i killed in a war 
now i want to go home  simple as that 
simple for you  perhaps 
even in russia  soldiers go home
when the treaty s signed  nyet 
that s not gonna happen  sorry 
all right  just the chance then 
your best efforts to get me free 
i ll settle for your word on it 
sorry 
so the jackal s after your director  is he 
tell him to get his affairs in order   
   because nobody can save him now 
nobody except me  because i met him 
yeah  didn t i mention it 
i can identify him by his face 
given the opportunity   
   but more importantly  by his methods 
so you can leave isabella out of this 
did you work with him 
with him  no  no way 
do you have a problem with this man 
that s between him and me 
isabella zancona
is the only confirmed contact we have   
   and we will find her 
with or without your help 
okay 
i want three things 
one  get me out of here 
  i m no use to you sitting here on my ass 
  what s to keep you from taking off 
nothing 
except i give you my word 
two  i go with you to meet isabella 
why 
i want to see her  is all 
and the third thing 
a decent razor 
here s how it ll go  mulqueen 
you will be searched on a random
schedule  if we turn up a paper clip   
   that hasn t been authorized  i ll send
you back  same for using the phone 
  what  you don t trust me 
  as far as i can throw you 
but i have little choice 
if you ve got any thoughts
about an ira snatch   
   we ll shoot to kill  them and you 
and not necessarily in that order 
understand 
i heard you 
go along and we ll get along 
i m gonna keep a real good eye on you 
miss koslova  is it 
what would your first name be then 
major 
major koslova 
a wee bit rusty  that s all 
subassembly of titanium 
as light as the stresses will allow 
the arm s got to traverse 270 degrees 
feed and drive mechanisms
run on 210 amp servos 
the whole thing s has to run off 12 volt dc 
yeah  it s a car battery  that s cool 
  how much weight is the arm supporting 
  fifty five kilograms 
it s a big fucker  yeah 
hey  you want one 
no 
i m gonna want this in eight days 
i can do that 
how much 
well  the titanium s gonna be a problem 
it s a listed material up here 
it s gonna take time  a little more money 
 50 000 
i mean  like   40 000 
all right  half now  half on delivery 
this sucker s definitely
gonna kick some ass  yeah 
get this straight 
when you finish this unit  you ll turn over
the plans and scrap material 
you ll forget about charlie murdock
and the tech specs on these plans 
shit  man  i m cool 
relax 
all right 
are you nervous 
eight years  that s a lifetime  isn t it 
hello 
  mr  decker  is it 
  yes 
hello there  i m declan mulqueen 
this is major koslova 
  how do you do 
  hi 
we d like to speak to your wife 
someone to see you 
i ll take the kids out back 
my beautiful irish   
they let me out to ask you something 
sir  i was thinking maybe we could
use the zancona woman as insurance   
   in case mulqueen gets happy feet 
  listen   
   however he plays it  we play it straight 
isabella zancona s involvement
remains classified 
that means nothing in the report 
no name  no location  nothing  got it 
yes  sir 
i never knew his name 
but he was definitely american 
he had some kind
of special military training   
   where he learned spanish 
in el salvador  i think 
i didn t like talking to him 
i suppose we were all dangerous people   
   but he was different 
declan was fire  all passion 
he had a cause 
this man was ice  no feeling  nothing 
okay  thank you  mrs  decker 
you ve been very helpful 
it s best if you keep our conversation
confidential  even from your husband 
don t worry about george 
he doesn t know anything
about my past and he doesn t want to 
all he needs to know is that i love him 
i see 
i thank you again 
i ll wait for you in the car 
this opens a locker
at norfolk greyhound terminal 
inside is a clean passport and  10 000 cash 
your friends left it with me
in case you ever showed up 
take it and go back to ireland 
i can t 
what 
you gave your word 
go now 
once he kills whoever he s after 
they ll send you back to prison 
when i believe that  i ll use the key 
are you happy at least 
yes  i love my children 
and my husband  in my way  i mean 
some nights i can close my eyes
and sleep   
   and no dead faces come to wake me 
that s more than i ever had 
you wouldn t have me give that up 
would you 
give me some credit  will you 
she s basque  isn t she 
aye 
they say basques live by the vendetta 
if they hate someone  it s to the death 
it s the same way when they love 
my first name is valentina 
you have family in russia 
my parents  my brother  in the navy 
husband  kids 
no  i have not found the time 
in truth  it s never been a conflict for me 
this is not a quality
a man looks for in a woman 
by the way   
   whatever isabella gave you after i left   
   i trust you won t use it
until after our business is concluded 
don t miss a thing  do you 
no  mr  mulqueen 
i see everything 
maybe we should start
by canceling your public appearances 
no  i don t think that s necessary 
i mean  not yet 
this fellow s gonna need to
make preparations  he ll need time 
  how tight are the borders 
  mexico and canada have   
mr  mulqueen 
something you d like to share 
he ll likely be using four false identities 
three will be on him  and one
in reserve at a drop box somewhere 
  that s the way he used to operate 
  what matter if he has 40 
it s still one man  might we not
be creating a storm in a tea cup 
exactly  i agree with you 100 percent 
director bolitonov 
terek has always made
doing his own killing a point of honor 
usually very bloody and very public 
a statement  if you will 
so  if he s hired an outsider   
   obviously  this is something
he takes very seriously 
until this jackal is captured or killed   
   i don t think we can afford to do any less 
come on  let s get real here  it s one guy 
it s just one guy  bolitonov s right 
with the assets in this room 
the guy s as good as got 
that s if he doesn t blow it first   
   like a lot of these clowns 
remember that guy  what was his name 
what s that  mr  mulqueen 
i m sorry  mr  brown 
but this man is no clown 
he knows all your moves  back to front 
right now  you got a name 
that s all you got 
the jackal s got a target  you 
he s got a timetable 
as to making mistakes  he s spent 20 years
in a trade that doesn t forgive error 
and he s prevailed 
you think he s the one
who is up against us 
it s the other way around 
  hi 
  hi 
  can i buy you a drink 
  yeah 
i think you should come home with me 
i d love to   
   but i can t 
i have to go back to atlanta   
   to finalize my very messy divorce 
does she know 
she does now 
so how am i gonna see you again 
you could give me one of your cards 
you re not gonna call 
douglas 
you just have to have
a little faith in people  that s all 
like i do 
open your shirt 
  easy now  easy 
  now 
easy 
open your shirt 
easy now 
souvenirs of british hospitality 
i apologize 
no problem 
oslo travel came up with a james william
hayslip who flew from toronto   
   august 25  two days before
the meeting with terek 
we checked the social security number
on his passport  and guess what 
it belongs to an inmate committed to a
mental institution in virginia 12 years ago 
now  canadian travel says he flew   
   to montreal nine days ago 
hello 
hello 
  yeah 
  yeah  charlie murdock 
picking up a delivery  eh 
invoice 
yes 
  it s a hot one  eh 
  you can say that again 
hi  i need to use one of your computers 
sure  any one 
can i get on line with this 
yeah  sure 
go check upstairs 
thank you 
hayslip s disappeared 
border patrol has the passport photo 
but nothing s shown up yet 
  he s moved on  i told you 
  one moment 
the only place we re sure
he s been is montreal 
what if he started using
the next identity there 
i m not following you 
hayslip disappeared 
that doesn t mean the jackal did 
perhaps something has happened 
witherspoon  have the montreal police
check their logs for the last 48 hours 
if he s on to the next name 
it s because it s in the plan 
  a man like this doesn t make mistakes 
  no 
they always make one  somewhere 
isn t that how you were caught 
what s her story  then 
major koslova   
   ends the debate about
women in combat  as far as i m concerned 
how s that 
when she saved my life
and took out terek s brother   
   she did it knowing she d be drawing
a death sentence down on her own neck 
but when we offered to set her up
someplace else when this is over   
   you know what she said 
 the good guys don t hide  
fierce woman 
in that country  under that system   
staggering 
oh  shit  you know what 
i couldn t get titanium 
so  i had a friend mold the base
out of carbon fiber instead 
came in 23 kilos
under the weight you asked for 
  is that cool 
  yeah  that s great 
i m still gonna want the plans  the mold
and the scrap material  remember 
yeah 
  maybe we ought to talk about that 
  oh 
this rig  i figure it s to support
something pretty heavy  right 
like a gatling gun  maybe 
or a 20 millimeter cannon 
you must be shooting
at something pretty big 
armored car  maybe 
bank vault 
i don t know  you could be shooting
a fucking airliner for all i know 
but the point is   
   a job like this
can attract a lot of attention 
i don t want any attention 
right  right  that s why i m saying   
   i think the plans
and mold are worth a little bonus 
  how much 
  i don t know 
 100 000 
come on  man  you know it s worth it 
you got a serious piece of equipment 
all right 
i ll get you  50 000 tomorrow 
i m gonna need a place to test this 
someplace that won t draw any attention 
we got a place like that 
we got a place just like that 
target s in place 
man  i should have brought some beer 
motherfuckin  motherfucker 
that motherfucker is state of the art 
i knew it was gonna be big  i didn t know
it was gonna be the prototype cannon 
it s a fucking mole 
  some hairy iooking rounds 
  made from depleted uranium 
it ll go through anything 
once they get inside  they just spall 
hell  yeah  they spall 
they get in there  and they just   
that rocks 
  look at the lens on that thing 
  don t touch that 
it s got  like  a 2 000 mile zoom lens 
that thing is kick ass 
dude  is this thing a prototype  or what 
i bet you it cost you a shitload 
that rocks 
man  you rock 
do you know what i m saying 
rock 
fucking thing kicks ass 
bring on the spall  baby 
  i can t wait to see the fuck   
  lamont 
close your mouth 
smooth action  yeah 
ready 
yeah  spall 
well  at least   
   it took out the target 
  no  it s off   
   by at least three millimeters 
no  dude  that s precision craftsmanship 
  it isn t off by three millimeters 
  so  lamont   
   tell me how you sight
in this thing automatically 
punch in the windage and
the elevation you want and hit enter 
  so you just kind of guestimate it  huh 
  basically guestimation 
and hit enter 
i give up 
  i guess the automatic sighting works 
  yeah 
  i thought i was about to sprawl 
  well  lamont   
   gonna have to speed test it now 
  speed test 
so  run 
what do you mean 
i mean run  now 
run to your right 
get up 
all right  good  stop there 
just stop there 
turn around 
hold out that pack of cigarettes 
don t be afraid 
stand very still 
stand still 
i told you it was off 
move over by the car 
quick  before you pass out 
here we go  sir  major  mac 
eleven days ago  charles c  murdock
bought himself a new dodge minivan 
that was a big surprise to mr  murdock   
   whose passport and wallet were stolen
16 days ago at the helsinki airport 
anything from the border 
we sent a description of the van
from here to manitoba 
i have something  uphall station 
it s a small town outside ottawa 
  i think your man has been there 
  let s go 
the owner is lan lamont  small time hood 
the coroner has what s left of him
at broxburn 
we get the idea  let s get to the shop 
hello  think i got something here 
what is it 
this is a remote firing station 
see  it maneuvers a weapon 
the servos run off a remote control 
like a model airplane 
we used to make these things
for mortars or   
   such but nothing like this size 
he needs a van just to move it around 
what would something this size
be used for 
  antiaircraft 
  no  you can buy a mount for that 
a missile s the best thing for an aircraft 
  no  this is for something else entirely 
  something with one hell of a range 
not just the range  though 
see  if it is a gun  it s the cyclic rate 
you can send off a hundred bullets
before the first one ever hits the target 
good thing about a boat like this
is it sells itself 
it s a hell of a lot of boat for the money 
it s got radar   
   gps  autopilot  auto furling 
you can take this baby out by yourself 
this has even got a cellular phone 
you can call your wife if you want to 
so  what do you think 
 deja vu  
she s perfect 
  yes 
  jackal 
they know about hayslip 
they know you were in canada 
and they have an irishman helping them 
  irishman s name 
  mulqueen 
  declan mulqueen 
  declan mulqueen 
the operation s still a go 
declan 
every crossing point and airport has
his photograph  but rcmp has nothing 
our border patrol 
the ins are both on the highest alert 
again  nothing 
let s face it  you don t have to be houdini
to make it across from canada 
  he probably walked across 
  he won t be walking  i can tell you that 
he s got a weapon to move 
  what kind of patrols do you have here 
  the great lakes 
not a lot  no need 
people either drive or fly 
there are a few ferry services 
but we checked those out as well 
what about people with boats 
what kind of immigration controls
do you have 
arriving vessels have to
check with the harbormaster 
  voluntarily 
  yeah  no active enforcement 
say he does use a boat 
he ll still want to mix with others 
are there many gatherings to speak of 
yeah  the mackinaw regatta
is going on now 
  it s the biggest regatta on lake michigan 
  from where to where 
it starts in mackinaw
and it ends in chicago 
witherspoon  take waveland 
declan  valentina  chicago yacht club 
i ll take the locals  and remember   
   it ll be an ontario boat if it s here 
look at everything and stay on your radios 
if you do find something  call in backup 
i want an arrest  not a firefight

do you have a gun 
following a low light helicopter insertion   
   a team could infiltrate the weapon here   
   covering the northern approaches
and route 1 
if your weapon has nearly the range
and cyclic rate you re advertising   
   it could engage
any ground vehicle and aircraft 
he doesn t have a helicopter
or a team to help him set up 
he s alone 
what do you say  mulqueen 
well  the only way he can make
the kill and escape is from a distance 
so we make sure you re
always secure indoors   
   with a perimeter of men
outside your location 
  and pick our battles 
  exactly 
tying a noose  if you like 
when he makes his move   
   we tighten the noose and we hang him 
not exactly foolproof  i know   
   but it s the best we got 
  the best we ve got 
  you have a call on line six 
  thank you 
  this is doug 
  told you i d call 
hi  how are you 
you ve just have to have
a little faith in people 
okay  well  okay 
now that i ve got faith   
   are you busy tonight 
you re in town  yes 
hello 
i m home 
i see you found the keys 
where are you 
in the garage 
  wow  you dyed your hair 
  yeah

yeah  sure 
you like korean food 
sure  yeah 
dig in 
i thought we were gonna   
oh  i m sorry 
i thought we were gonna go out 
yeah  maybe later 
recapping tonight s top story   
   police are asking for your help
in locating this man 
he s wanted in connection
with a series of brutal murders 
police believe he s in
the washington area tonight 
the man is armed
and extremely dangerous 
if you see him  do not to approach him 
but notify authorities immediately 
you know  when i first moved here   
   i realized i was living
in someone else s house   
   and that s a huge burden 
you re invited   
   to live in the white house for four years   
you feel like a renter in a sense 
most definitely 
with a lease that s renewable or   
john f  kennedy said once that if
somebody wanted to kill a public official   
   they can get away with it
if they re willing to pay the price 
it s impossible to provide
100 percent safety  would you agree 
certainly 
there is no way around that 
but hopefully   
   there aren t that many people
who are willing to do that 
what 
do you remember valentina said 
 a statement  public and brutal  
now  it always bothered me 
why did he keep coming 
he knew we could protect the director 
especially once i got involved 
but he didn t abort  why 
it didn t come together until
i remembered what he said to valentina 
 tell declan he can t protect his women  
  wasn t he referring to isabella 
  no  any woman  all women 
but remember   public and brutal  
we re guarding the wrong person 
he s after the first lady 
ladies and gentlemen  welcome 
i m sure you re as happy
as i am to be here today 
it s been a lot of hard work for a lot of us   
   but here we are 
and we re about to celebrate 
and now it gives me great pleasure
to introduce the surgeon general   
   of the united states 
madam chairperson 
ladies and gentlemen   
   i d like to chat with you today
about the family 
she s already on the stage 
secret service wants to know
what s going on 
  tell them 
  no  they ll try to get her off the stage 
if they do that 
he ll shoot off into the crowd 
we ve worked long and hard
to reach our goal   
   and i must say that we have
accomplished what we set out to do   
   since we first began   
   with a seed of an idea 
it took many long and hard hours to   
get the word 
looking for a dark brown minivan
and anything else that s out of place 
the only minivan we found
is this red one here 
i checked it out 
they got a local parking permit   
   dc tags 
we can check it out again  if you want 
it s probably one of those safer than sorry 
circle jerk type deals 
i ll see you 
you guys be safe 
secret service says
the search came out negative 
they re on alert 
but she s going to the podium 
guess it s on us 
you ll need a gun 
forget the laser  you ll have to walk me
through the optics on this thing 
i haven t shot a gun in a while 
i can see by the warm
and friendly faces out there   
   that this christening
has been long anticipated 
thanks to all of you
who made this dream possible 
we ve worked long and hard
to reach our goal   
   and i must say that we certainly have
accomplished what we set out to do 
it s proof that when we set out
to reach new heights  it can be done 
go  clear 
go  clear 
i m going for the first lady 
you re cleared to shoot
on the weapon or the shooter 
ladies and gentlemen 
it gives me great pleasure   
   to introduce the first lady
of the united states 
it s a beautiful day
for the beginning of new hope 
all right  go 
give me the gun 
so that s how he plans to get out 
the phone  give me your phone 
but also right now   
   there are police officers
risking their very lives   
   to help kids stay out of trouble
and off drugs 
but also right now 
there are dedicated teachers   
   preparing lessons for a new day s class 
  red minivan  hillside by the trees 
  one o clock 
  jesus 
  range it 
750  762 meters 
   but values his family 
right  i m after him 
you take out the minivan 
move it  go 
coming through 
look out  coming through 
  excuse me

you just have to put down your little gun 
okay

you re slipping  declan 
now let her go 
step away from the gun 
step away from the gun 
maggie  maggie 
you re so brave 
you ll remember this
for the rest of your life 
kneel down 
kneel down 
sorry  declan 
it s all right  it s okay

it s finished 
i wonder if we ll ever know   
   who the hell he really was 
we know all we need to  he was evil   
   he s dead and he s gone 
nothing more matters 
sorry they didn t give you your pardon 
you ll get minimum security 
it s like a country club 
by the way 
director brown sends his warmest thanks 
oh  that s nice 
look forward to playing tennis with him 
did i tell you i m going back to russia 
and i m going to stay until terek murad
rots in prison or in the grave 
she d appreciate that 
i think so 
and isabella 
back safe with her family 
for good 
i know about that key she gave you 
i know you could have used it
to take off any time you wanted to 
you ve got one of those
drop boxes  too  like the jackal 
did you read the paper today 
i m quite the hero because of you 
the agent who saved the first lady 
i could screw everything else up
for the rest of my life and still be   
   untouchable 
that a fact  then 
going back to the drop box 
an operative with your experience   
   with a clean passport   
   a wad of cash 
i ll bet if you had taken off   
   we never would have found you 
do you drink coffee 
oh  no  that s right 
they drink guinness in ireland 
i ll ask across the street 
see if they ve got any
