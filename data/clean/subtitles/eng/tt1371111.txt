full of voices 
ancestry howlin  at you 
yibberin  stories 
all voices    tied up into one 
one voice different   
one voice 
whisperin  out there 
spyin  from the dark 
that fangy devil 
ol  georgie himself 
now you hear up close 
and i ll yarn you about
the first time we met 
eye to eye 
and thus it was when i made the
acquaintance of dr  henry goose 
the man i hoped might
cure me of my afflictions 
have you lost something 
question one 
what secret in sixsmith report
would be worth killing for 
question two 
is it reasonable to believe that they
would kill again to protect that secret 
and if so  question three 
what the fuck am i doing here 
while my extensive
experience as an editor
has lead me to a disdain for flashbacks
and flash forwards  and
all such tricksy gimmicks 
i believe that if you  dear reader 
can extend your patience
for a just a moment 
you will find there is a
method to this tale of madness 
my dearest sixsmith 
i shot myself through the
roof of my mouth this morning 
with vivian ayre s luger 
a true suicide is a paced 
disciplined certainty 
people pontificate
 suicide is a coward s act  
couldn t be further from the truth 
suicide takes tremendous courage 
any problem  sir  you
just hit this button 
thank you 
on behalf of my ministry 
and the future of unanimity 
i would like to thank you
for this final interview 
  hello    press pass 
expecting trouble 
i was dermot hoggins  publisher 
not his shrink or his astrologer 
and the ruddy  bloody truth is 
i had no idea what the man
was gonna do that night 
this beach was once a
cannibal s banqueting hall 
where the strong gorged on the weak 
but the teeth  sir  they spat out 
like you and i would
expel a cherry stone 
do you know the price a quarter
pound of these will earn 
remember this is not an
interrogation or a trial 
your version of the
truth is all that matters 
truth is singular 
its  versions  are    mistruths 
don t let them say i
killed myself for love 
had my infatuations  but
we both know in our hearts
who is the sole love of
my short  bright life

there you are  mr  ewing 
as binding a covenant there
can ever be between men   
outside the province of scripture 
thank you  reverend horrox  i   
know my father in law is
profoundly excited about this deal 
haskell moore is a great man 
future generations
depend on men like him 
men capable of speaking the truth 
quite 
when i first encountered
haskell moore s writing 
its perspicuity stroke me as though
delivered through divine revelation 
the learned doctor here and i 
already spent many a night
debating mr  moore s tractus 
i m only willing to conceive
that he makes a compelling case
as to why we are sitting here 
enjoying this divine lamb 
while kupaka stands
there  contempt to serve 
indeed  ain it  uh  kupaka   
you enjoy your life
here with us  do you not 
oh  yes  reverend  sir 
kupaka very happy here 
see  you see  this is moore s
ladder of civilization 
the reason behind this natural order   
please  giles  do shut up 
i ve been listening
to this for weeks  i   
would love to know what his own
son in law has to say about it 
let s see   
it is an inquiry concerning
god s will and the nature of men 
and what does he have to say
about the nature of women 
i m afraid that s a subject he
prefers to pass by in silence 
he wouldn t be the first 
uh  prey  mr  ewing  continue 
well  uh    the question
he does pose is   
if god created the world  how do
we know what things we can change 
and what things must remain
sacred and inviolable 
reverend horrox  real
specific how to run plantation 
georgian way best way he say 
god  this heat is unbearable 
how do they take it 
reverend horrox say
slaves like camel  bred for desert 
he say    they not feel
heat like civilized folk 
now we should get you out of the sun 
now what    what is that noise 
  ah  there you are    what happened 
it is as i suspected 
gusano coco cervello 
better known as the polynesian worm 
once saw a man s brain after
the worm had finished with him   
maggoty cauliflower  ooph 
but have no fear  this particular
devil and i    are well acquainted 
here we go  ah  yes  yes  all gone 
i
  i don t know what i would have done had our paths not crossed 
well for starters  you would have died 
i    i shall find a way to repay you 
oh  unnecessary  i assure
you  i am a doctor  adam 
a tiger cannot change its stripes 
cambridge  1936
sixsmith  i do hope you will be able
to find it in your heart to forgive me 
mr  frobisher 
mr  robert frobisher 
the management would like a
word with you  please  sir 
mr  frobisher  open this door  please 
i do know you re in there 
mr  frobisher  please  comply 
a letter is being drafted
to your father  sir 
mr  frobisher 
hated leaving you like that 
wasn t the goodbye i had in mind 
by the time you read this  i
will be on my way to edinburgh 
on my way to fame and fortune 
i know you haven t heard
of him  but trust me 
vivian ayres is one of the
musical greats  sixsmith 
the tragedy is that he hasn t produced
any new work in years due to illness 
my scheme is to persuade him
to hire me as his amanuensis 
and aid him in the
creation of a masterpiece 
before shooting up through
the musical firmament 
eventually obliging
pater to admit that yes 
the son he disinherited is none
other than robert frobisher 
the greatest british
composer of his time 
i know  sixsmith  you groan and
shake your head  but you smile too 
which is why i love you 
p s  
thanks for the waistcoat 
i needed something of
yours to keep me company 
st  george and the dragon 
reminds me that composing is a crusade 
sometimes you slay the dragon 
sometimes the dragon slays you 
alright  then 
frobisher  is it 
i trust mackerras told
you enough to be useful 
i ve had this little melody for viola
rattling about my head for months 
let s see if you can get it down 
subtle grace note before the third 
soft and simple  got it 
now  it gets interesting 
good 
play that back 
would love to  sir 
um    what key are we in 
what key  g minor  of course 
and the time signature 
for christ s sake 
did you hear it or not 
  just    just need a
little more time    you need 
my dear boy  who is
working for whom here 
  i apologize  sir      are you
an amanuensis or an apologist 
now pay attention 
three four  changes to
four four on fourth bar
and back to three four on bar five 
if you can count that high 
crotchet g  pause for a quaver  repeat
g quaver  then e flat on the down beat 
and so on 
alright  let me hear you 
stop  please  you re hurting me 
you must have misheard me  i
said i had a melody not a malady 
vivian   
jocasta  deliver me 
  what s going on in here 
  an exercise in futility 
should i be introduced 
there s really no point  the
boy is useful as the clap 
fortunately  he ll be
much easier to get rid of 
would you be a dear and get
henry to show the boy out 
yes  of course  darling 
that s beautiful 
yes   
that s it  that s my melody 
san francisco  1973
com on  luisa  we re

can t leave me  it s a   
don t know if it s a past life
thing or a future life thing 
but you know  you and me   
look  for the last hour  all i could think
about was throwing you off the balcony 
well then who the
hell you think you are 
you write a bullshit
column for a fucking rag 
elevator 
thank you 
nice to know the age
of chivalry isn t dead 
you okay 
no bones broken  i think 
no  no  no  you sit    you
sit yourself  let me see 
great  power outage 
perfect end to a perfect day 
still glad the age of
chivalry isn t dead 
i d still rather be right
here than back up there 
guess mr  kipin isn t
everyone s cup of tea 
guys like that are just
an occupational hazard 
  you were interviewing him 
  yeah  for spyglass magazine 
luisa rey 
rufus sixsmith 
rey   
you wouldn t happen to be related
to the journalist lester rey 
yeah  he was my father 
really  he must have been
enormously proud of you 
  following in his footsteps    hmm 
that s her  my niece  megan 
she s lovely 
born physicist  with a better mind
for mathematics than i ever had 
did her phd at cambridge 
a woman at caius 
gives you hope for the world 
it s hot 
and we re still here 
that s a very peculiar birthmark 
yeah  my little comet 
my mother was sure it was cancer 
she wanted me to get it removed  but   
don t know  i kinda like it 
i knew someone who had
a birthmark that was   
  similar to that    really 
who was it 
someone i cared about very much 
a uh    a hypothetical
question for you  miss rey 
as a journalist 
what price would you pay
to protect the source 
any 
prison 
if it came to that  yes 
would you be prepared to   
compromise your safety 
my father braved
booby trapped marshes and
the wrath of generals for
his journalistic integrity 
what kind of daughter would i be if i
bailed when things got a little tough 
saved 
taxi

cab    no  i ve got my car

ever something i can do for you 
please give me a call 
thank you  i will

london  2012
it was the night of the lemon prizes 
and in its two lead forced duality 
i recall a moment of introspection 
why  why would anyone in their
right mind choose to be a publisher 
this was the precise
moment that dermot found me 
  oy  timothy    aah  dermot 
bad news inexorably does 
fockin  waste 
never forget herman melville 
writes a ripping yarn about a big white
whale which is summarily dismissed 
and yet today  it is lugged
around in the backpacks
of every serious student
of literature in the world 
i don t give a fock what
happens when i m dead 
i want people to buy me book now 
well  as your publisher  obviously
nothing would make me happier 
but sadly  for whatever reason 
 knuckle sandwich  has yet
to connect to its audience 
you want a reason 
i ll give you a reason 
  right there    aah 
you mean mr  finch 
felix fockin  finch 
that cunt that shat all over me
book in his poncy fockin  magazine 
  it wasn t that bad    no 
 mr  hoggins should apologize to the
trees failed for the making of his
bloated autobio novel  four
hundred vain glorious pages
expire in an ending that is
flat and inane beyond belief   
steady now  dermot  what is a
critic but one who reads quickly 
arrogantly  but never wisely 
fock it 
dermot 
ladies and gentlemen 
we have an additional award
tonight  fellow book faeries 
an award for  most eminent critic  
mr    oh  beg pardon 
sir  felix finch  o  b and e 
and what might my prize be  i wonder 
a signed copy of an
unpulped  knuckle sandwich  
can t be many of those left 
well   
just what does that lead less
pencil you call an imagination
have in mind to end this scene  hmm 
i think you re gonna love this one 
now  that s an ending that
is flat n inane beyond belief 
my thoughts 
if i m honest  i admit that
the obvious emotions like shock
and horror flew as
finch had  here and gone 
tequila  couple of fingers 
while deep down  i
experienced a nascent sense
of a silver lining to
this most tragic turn 
overnight  dermot  dusty  hoggins
became a cult hero to the common man 
 knuckle sandwich  shifted ninety
thousand copies in less than two months 
i was for the briefest
of moments  cinderella 
and all memory of past misfortune
receded in the rearview mirror
of my dream come true 
  what the fuck      tim o tee
cavendish    oy presume 
caught wi  your cacks down 
uh  my office hours are
eleven to two  and my secretary
would be more than happy to schedule
an appointment if you so desire 
friends like us don t need appointments 
we like it all cozy like this 
  visited dermot in the joint   
our brother s got a question for you 
where s our focking money 
boys  boys  look here 
dermot signed what we call a
copyright transfer contract 
which means that legally   
dermot didn t sign a fockin  contract
for the event of a fockin  season 
er  perhap perhaps    er  we
could moot a provisional sum   
as a basis for on going negotiation 
okeydokey 
what sum we gonna moot 
fifty k will do for starters 
fifty sounds reasonable 
tomorrow afternoon 
tomorrow afternoon 
  cash    no bullocks 
  no checks    old fashioned money 
gentlemen   
  the law says      the law  
what d the law do for

ordinarily  i begin by asking prisoners
to recall their earliest memories   
to provide a context for the
corporatic historians of the future 
fabricants have no such
memories  archivist 
one twenty four hour cycle in papa
song s is identical to every other 
may i say you speak
consumer surprisingly well 
it is unfortunate that the officials of
the unanimity can only speak one language 
as an officer of unanimity  i am of
course restricted from using sub speak 
of course 
please describe a typical
twenty four hour papa song cycle 
at hour four  each server
is woken by auto stimulin 
from revival  we
proceed to the hygiener 
after dressing  we file into the dinery 
at hour five  we man our stations
to greet the new day s consumers 
welcome to papa song s 
for the next nineteen hours  we
input orders  tray food  vend drinks 
upstock condiments  wipe
tables  and bin garbage 
all done in strict
adherence to first catechism 
what is the first catechism 
 honor thy consumer   
after the final cleaning 
we imbibe one soap sack
and return to our sleep box 
that is the blueprint
of every single day 
did you ever think about the future 
papa song servers have
just one possible future 
you mean  exultation  
could you describe this
annual rite of passage 
on first day  seer rhee would
stamp a star on each of our collars 
twelve stars meant an
end to our contract 
how did you feel when you watched
one of your sisters ascend 
excitement 
i was happy for them 
but envious as well 
did your sister servers feel as you did 
most of them 
i would like to ask about
the infamous yoona 939 
if yoona 939 woke you  who woke her 
seer rhee 
why would seer wake a server 
perhaps you should ask him  archivist 
what s wrong with him 
he drinks soap 
it makes him happy 
then he sleep like us in our box 
do you ever think about    what it must
be like  up there with the consumers 
third catechism forbids such questions 
yes  it does 
come  let me show you a secret

friday the 15th  we made
sail with the morning tide 
mr  boerhaave had my cabin changed 
i have been quarantined to a store room
away from the other passengers and crew 
henry argued in vain that the
polynesian worm was not contagious 
not that it matters 
all i want to do now is return home
and unburden myself
from this responsibility 
my dear sixsmith  i am in
desperate need of your help 
after my last letter  i m sure
you re rushing to pack your bags 
but you needn t  really 
unless of course  you wish to witness
the rebirth of robert frobisher 
is it not miraculous how one s fortune
can turn so quickly  so completely 
one moment  leaping from
a hotel window  the next
gainfully employed by one of the
world s greatest living composers 
my only problem is that i
accidentally got hooked on a journal
written in 1849 by a dying
lawyer during the voyage
from the pacific
islands to san francisco 
to my great annoyance  the
pages cease mid sentence 
half the book is missing 
it s completely getting me 
could you be a mensch and
when you re next foraging
at otto s book s  make an inquiry 
a half finished book is  after
all  a half finished love affair 
america loves oil 
america is addicted to oil 
some fantasize about
wind turbines or peat gas 
but i m here today to
tell you that the cure
for oil is right here 
the cure is nuclear power 
the cure is swannekke 
hello  miss rey  i m frightfully
sorry for calling you at this hour 
dr  sixsmith 
i need help 
i need   50 000  not 2 000  50 000 
i m going through it again  mr 
cavendish  but the total s right 
2 343 pounds and 16 pence 
how is this possible  the
ruddy money was pouring in 
debts mostly  mr  cavendish 
solvency has its drawbacks 
the situation looked dire 
but i knew that timothy
cavendish s capital in this town
could not be defined by an
accountant s balance sheet 
mccluskie 
look  how are those
delightful kiddies of yours 
mon cher  tis  cavendish the
ravenous   your favorite timothy 
mon cher 
you heard it correctly 
charles dickens  own original
authentic writing desk for  
60 000  i think that s very fair 
but our records indicate that
the desk is already accounted for
by the dickens house museum 
okay  what about sir
arthur conan doyle s desk 
in the darkness  i
suddenly saw the light 
blood has always trumped water 
if the hogginses brutes wanted
to turn this into a family affair 
they d find the cavendish clan more
than ready for the task at hand 
oh  satan s gonads  not again  look 
just bugger off and leave us in peace 
i m only gonna asking you nicely once 
good to see you  denny 
i m not lending you a ruddy farthing
until you pay back the last lot 
why why should i be forever
giving you a hand out 
denny   
i had a minor running
with the wrong sort 
if i don t get my hands on   60 000 
i got to get an awful beating 
well  get them to video it for
us  would you  now fuck off 
  i m not joking  denholme

denny  help

den  who are you talking to 
  hello  georgette    hello  timothy 
right  right  right 
what did you 60 grand 
it s gonna take some time  but  uh   
in the interim  i ve got the
perfect place for you to hide 
i begun to fear i might never hold
my beloved tilda in her arms again 
my parasite writhes at night 
igniting spasms of pain 
while visions and voices 
obscene and monstrous  haunt me 
mister ewing   
in the name of god 
mister ewing  no fear 
no harm  not shout 
please  my name autua 
you know i    see moriori whip i   
you know i 
  what do you want 
  you help  mr  ewing 
if you no help  i in trouble dead 
well  you re already very
much  in trouble dead   
the prophetess is a mercantile vessel 
not an underground railroad
for escaping slaves 
i be able seaman  i earn passage 
well  then i suggest you surrender
to the captain s mercies forthwith 
wow wow  they no hear i 
they say  swim away home  nigger  
and throw i in drink  but you   
you law man  right  please 
captain hear you  mr  ewing 
i
  i can t help you 
i m afraid your fate is entirely
your own  and i desire no part in it 
then kill i 
don t be absurd   
if you no help  you kill i just
the same  is true  you know it 
i m be no fish food  mr  ewing 
die here better  do it 
do it quick 
i found an old transway marker  captain 
it s got to be the red mountain 
the problem is  the valley
people are afraid of it 
they think the devil lives up there 
i can t find anybody to guide
me through the kona territory 
meronym   
every day you re out there 
you increase your odd levels 
this dream of yours is going
to kill you  and for what 
the off world colonies
may no longer exist 
i got to go  captain 
thank you for coming  i m in 1404 
i ll be right up 
dr  sixsmith 
it s me  luisa 
go call the police  right
now  call the police 
my dear sixsmith  you alone can
understand how i m feeling right now 
today  ayrs and i presented our first
collaboration to tadeusz kesselring 
ayrs favorite conductor
who arrived from berlin 
it s called  eternal recurrence  
wish you could hear it 
it s the most accomplished tone
poem i know of written since the war 
and i tell you  sixsmith 
that more than of the few
of its best ideas are mine 
at our time of life  ayrs  a man
has no right to such daring ideas 
i suppose i ve won a rearguard action
or two in my war against decrepitude 
diner of pheasant with
bordeaux rich as buttercream 
how i love to listen to
men of distinguished lives 
sing of past follies and glories 
the only broken note in the entire
evening was ayrs wife  jocasta 
excusing herself early 
sensed the buried bone 
later i asked ayrs about it 
he said kesselring had
introduced jocasta to him 
i pried  had kesselring
been in love with her 
the subject was a prickly one 
jocasta is a jew 
obviously her relationship
was impossible 
why obviously 
can you really be so ignorant
of what is happening in germany 
at this point in my life 
all i know  sixsmith 
is that this world spins
from the same unseen forces
that twist our hearts 
  how is it  mr  zachry    thin whiles

a powerful déjà vu
ran through my bones 
i had been there before 
another lifetime ago 
ursula 
the love of my life 
i could think of no
other serious applicants 
what had happened to her 
and more importantly 
what had happened to the young man
who had ridden the same
train composing sonnets

welcome to neo seoul

this    maybe the biggest
mistake of my life  but here

worried you might try and eat me 
if you didn t get
something in the stomach 
oh  you safe  mr  ewing 
i no like white meat 
ah  right 
before i decide what
i m going to do with you 
tell me why you were
being whipped so savagely 
my uncle was a sailor 
he took me on a french whaler
when i was ten years old 
seen too much of the world 
i no good slave 
why did you look at me 
pain strong  right 
friends eye more strong 
look  you are a runaway
slave  and i am a lawyer 
how did you imagine we
could possibly be friends 
all you need 
ah  jesus 
javier gomez  what did i tell
you about jumping onto my balcony 
why d you leave the door open
if you don t want me to come in 
because  smarty pants 
the only thing worse than having
you jumping onto my balcony 
is the idea of you jumping onto my
balcony  and being stuck out there 
okay 
what are you reading 
old letters 
sixsmith  the plot has
taken a sensual turn 
last week  jocasta and i became lovers 
but don t alarm yourself  it is only
a carnal act  performed in service 
not unlike my role as amanuensis 
and i confess women s hearts like
their desire remain a mystery to me 
afterward  she cried and thanked me
for bringing life back into their home 
i can get clear that vivian
had been there the entire night 
between us like the silence between
notes  that holds the key to warm music 
best news of all 
i ve started my own work 
uh  i    called about an old recording 
written by a man named robert frobisher 
oops  passed it 
i know i shouldn t be
pulling it  i was   
checking it to make
sure it wasn t scratched 
but    honestly 
i just can t stop listening to it 
this is the cloud atlas sextet 
it s    the symphony 
it s beautiful 
but i think i ve heard this before 
i can t imagine how 
i doubt there s no more than a    handful
copies in the whole of north america 
but i know it 
i know i know it 
before i realized it  my feet had brought
me back to the temple of sacrifice 
where i offered up my virginity 
back to those four days of paradise 
when ursula s mater and
pater slift off to greece 
for a long weekend   
or so we thought 
ursula 
naked 
sir  madam  i assure you
this is completely innocent   
two sprained ankles  one cracked rib 
official cause of accident 
listed on hospital form   
pussy 
what were the chances that
she still lived in this house 
and yet  there she was 
ursula 
why had i never returned
her calls or letters 
shame  spinessless  hallmarks
of the cavendish clan 
i realized i had a choice  i could
slink off and continue as planned 
or i could go boldly to the door 
and discover what hope 
if any  would lay within 
abbess  come quick

  catkin    aye  she dyin

neo seoul will also be under
water in a hundred years

pureblood clothes

anything you need 
sir  just let me know 
we ll do  guys  i m
good  thank you very much 
our editor s trying to
spice things up a little bit 
he says the public wants
more substance  so   
probably just a fad 
come on  follow me  let s start
you with the chicken ranch 
that is where we keep the eggheads 
hello  mr  cavendish 
feeling super this morning 
no  i checked in last night  believing
that aurora house was a hotel 
my brother made the booking you
see  his idea of a practical joke 
but listen  you have a
bigger problem closer to home 
there s some demented bitch
calling herself noakes 
rampaging about the place 
impersonating a chamber maid 
but the point is this  she
struck me  and she stole my keys 
right  i ll need those
keys back  straight away 
aurora house is your home now 
mr  cavendish  your signature
  authorizes us to apply      signature 
the custody document
you signed last night 
your residency papers 
oh no  no  no  that
was the hotel register 
ah  never mind  it s all academic  huh 
this is gonna make a hell
of a diner party story 
most of our guests get cold
feet on their first mornings 
  my keys  please 
  residents are not     
i m not a ruddy resident 
you ll find temper tantrums
won t help you at aurora house 
you re breaking the    ruddy   
acting    conservation
act  or some ruddy thing 
and i will not be subjugated
to a criminal abuse 
i will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse 
outside  fat snow flakes
are forming on slate roofs 
like solzhenitsyn laboring in
vermont  i shall beaver away in exile 
unlike solzhenitsyn  i shan t be alone 
off somewhere 
you bet i am  to the land of the living 
soylent green is people 
soylent green is made of people 
oy  get back here  you 
you keep away from me  or
i ll be forced to name you 
in the police report  as an accomplice 
i have better things to do than this 
then go  pit and do them 
you bloody sucker son of   
right 
god  you take hands off
me  you ruddy bloody   
you can maintain power over people 
as long as you give them something 
rob a man of everything  and that
man will no longer be in your power 
alexander solzhenitsyn  20th
century philosopher complete works 
and by unanimity 
how do you know about him 
hae ju 
  sir zheng    please 
you must call me hae ju 
hae ju   
fabricants can be excised for this   
well  survival often
demands some courage 
knowledge is a mirror  and
for the first time in my life 
i was allowed to see who i
was  and who i might become 
go clean the head 
good morning  captain 
you re the hell that remains 
old quail cock  by buggering off 
i m afraid i can t do it  sir 
if i was  i would be unable
to inform you of the stow away
  that i have discovered
in my      stow away 
i assure you that this
moriori had no choice 
now he has sworn to me that he is
a first class  able bodied seaman 
capable of earning passage
if only given a chance 
stow away  he s a stow away 
even if he shits silver nuggets 
did he ever explain anything to you 
he told me their goal was the
creation of a free willed fabricant 
yoona had failed 
i was their last hope 
i have to say if all lady
journalists look like you 
i might start to take this  uh 
women s lib thing more seriously 
well  i m sure they can use your sort 
nice 
okay  uh  you wait here and i will
go find someone smarter who can  uh 
walk you through the details
of some of your questions 
right 
what would dad do 
who the bloody hell is this 
have you any idea what time it is 
  denny  it s me  tim 
  timothee 
where are you 
ah  i think you ruddy
know about where i am 
but residents are
denied access to phones 
someone smuggled one in 
  you know the rules 
  i helped write them  timmy 
i have been a principal investor
in aurora house for twelve years 
it s incredibly lucrative 
you can t believe what people
would pay to lock out their parents 
look  den  you ve had your fun 
i think it s high time you put an
end to this little game of yours 
no  no  no  timmy 
my fun has just begun 
what are you talking about 
i am your brother  why
are you doing this to me 
i think the better question is would
be  what have you done to deserve this 
i don t know what you mean 
oh come  naughty old
brother  don t insult me 
you can t think that i didn t
know about you and georgette 
georgette 
look  den   
i didn t mean to hurt you 
i m afraid your penance
has come due  timbo 
it s time to account for your crimes 
den   
  i m    i m so  so sorry 
  no no no  there s
no need to apologize 
your exile is more
than enough reparation 
oh  i do have my fingers crossed
for a scenario involving you 
nurse noakes and a broom handle 
cherry up  timmy  bye bye now 
he sends his love 
i would like to ask about
the night of your arrest 
i remember    listening
to his heart beat 
your heart beats much slower than ours 
there is a gentleness to the sound 
i find it    comforting 
  vivian  what time is it 
  i don t know  who cares   
i ve heard a melody  boy  for violin 
quick   
find find a pen 
i heard it in a dream  it
was in a nightmarish café   
blurry  bright lights  but
underground and no way out 
and the waitresses   
they all had the same face 
there was music played  not like
any music i ve ever heard in my life 
it began    it began   
wait   
it was so clear a minute ago 
help me  robert  help
me  it s slipping away 
i ve lost it 
it ll come to you  sir 
the minute you stop trying
to find it  it will find you 
you are naive  robert 
i am anything but 
there is a gulf between these chairs 
what you want is no
different from what i want 
the gulf is an illusion 
how do i describe
that night  sixsmith   
what had happened between vivian
and i transcended language 
it was music that poured from his
eyes  and breathed from his lips 
music as beautiful as
any i have ever heard 
what what are you doing in here 
they found us 
i ll be with you the
whole way  now focus on me 
stay with me 
right here  i won t let you go 
  mr  ewing    it it s alright 
i
  i talked to the captain  he ll hear your case 
what s your name  boy 
autua  sir 
the christian  gentlemen 
who knows nothing about ships 
tells me that you re
a first class sailor 
very well  let s see you d
lower the main top  son 
mr  roderick  my bottle is empty 
mr  boerhaave  ready my piece 
what  sir  you    gave
me your word  captain 
p
  please  you can t do this 
nobody tells me what i can
and cannot do on my own ship 
specially when it
concerns nigger stow away 
captain look  he s got
fish hooks for toes 
boerhaave  you don t
make a mess of my deck 
captain  please   
look  if you can just hear me  i m   
the darkie s salt as i am 
mr  boerhaave 
it appears we have an
addition to our crew 
make sure he earns his keep 
mr  hooks 
i found her  she was in the chem
labs  looking for the bathroom 
ah  well  perfect  then  uh  why
don t you take over from here  sachs 
you know  introduce our
little tribe  and uh   
and guide ms  rey through
the    through the tower 
the funny thing is  i am
not even supposed to be here 
i was meant to be in seoul  but
the air traffic controller strike
put everything up  so now i m
on the    time jumper tonight 
did you ever think that the
universe was against you 
all the time 
you mind 
i m cool 
you seem nervous  isaac 
  do i make you nervous    no 
actually  just the opposite 
will you gonna tell me
why you covered for me 
freedom  the fatuous
jingle of our civilization 
but only those deprived of it have the
barest inkling of what it really is 
there s much disagreement on
what should be done with you 
the corprocrats want you
euthanased as a deviant 
the manufacturer is
demanding a period of study 
the pyschogenomicists are screaming
for an immediate cerebral vivisection 
however  the problem you
create is a political one 
which means you are my problem 
i find it intriguing to
imagine that beneath this   
perfectly engineered features  are thoughts
that terrify the whole of unanimity 
i m not afraid of such thoughts 
because i do not fear the truth 
there s a natural order
to this world  fabricant 
and the truth is this
order must be protected 
inform the archivist 
prepare for excisement 
  yes sir    sir   
can you tell me what
happened to hae ju zheng 
killed  i was told 
all this feast and excitements 
really adam  it s   
all too much  you ll need to rest 
i had   
a girlfriend once  she kept trying
to get me to read carlos castenada 
  you ever read any of
that stuff    oh yeah 
but the relationship was doomed 
every time she brought up a new   
karma  that sort of stuff  i
  i couldn t stop myself from laughing 
and yet   
i can t explain   
that i knew when i opened that door   
they destroyed most of
the copies of the report 
most 
there s no good choice here  is there 
if i help you  i close my job   
or worse 
if i don t  a lot of people   
and it will be worse than worse 
you have to do   
whatever you can t not do 
someone preyin  on you  zachry 
you really ain t feary about
meetin  ol  georgie on the summit 
i m more scaresome  bout the
weather than in the devil 
you cog he s real 
who tripped the fall 
if not old georgie 
true true 
the old uns 
that s just a rope o smoke 
old uns got the smart 
they mastered sick and seeds 
they make miracles
and fly across the sky 
true  all true  but
they got somethin  else 
a hunger in their hearts  a hunger
that s stronger than all their smart 
hunger  for what 
a hunger for more 
belief like fear or love
is forced to be understood as we
understand the theory of relativity 
and principles of uncertainty 
phenomena that determine
the course of our lives 
yesterday  my life was
headed in one direction 
today  it is headed in another 
yesterday  i believe i would
never have done what i did today 
these forces that often
remake time and space 
they can shape and alter who
we imagine ourselves to be 
begin long before we are born 
and continue after we perish 
our lives and our choices
like quantum trajectories are
understood moment to moment
at each point of
intersection  each encounter 
suggest a new potential direction 
proposition 
i have fallen in love with luisa rey 
is this possible  i
just met her  and yet   
i feel like something
important has happened to me 
that s it 
the music from my dream 
this is from my dream  that
night i came to your room 
this is the music i heard in my
head  somehow i gave it to you 
i ve been working on
this piece for weeks now 
i suspect you heard it  and
incorporated it into your dream 
i call it the cloud atlas sextet 
this is obviously the
result of our collaboration 
the atlas  i believe 
is the only thing i ve done
in my life that is of value 
but i know i could not have written it 
if i hadn t met you 
there are whole movements in the
atlas that i ve read imagining us 
meeting again and again  in
different lives and different ages 
yes   
something as important as this cannot
be described as  yours  or  mine  
it is  ours  
that this is exactly how i feel  vivian 
i m sorry  i   
  i thought      you
thought  you thought what 
that i might fancy a little buggering
from a fine young dandy like yourself 
i pack my bag  and be gone by morning 
you ll do no such thing  you ll
leave only when i say you can leave 
you will continue working
on vivian ayre s cloud atlas 
when it is finished  then i
will decide what you do with you 
you can t keep me here  i m leaving 
good luck with your composing  i m
sure a sterile old fuck like yourself
is still capable of something
completely unmemorable 
i suggest you think about this 
robert  think about reputation 
reputation is everything in our society 
yours  my disinherited reprobate 
has expired 
did you not think that we would inquire
about someone living under our roof 
mackerras himself wrote  and i quote 
 he is a prostitute whose liaisons
with perverts and sodomites
were common place in his brief
and forgettable career at caius 
lock up the silverware    end of quote 
be warned  leave here
without my consent 
and all the musical society will know
of the degenerate robert frobisher 
after that 
even if you compose one of the
greatest symphonies ever written 
no one will hear it 
because no one will want
anything to do with you 
i won t let you go again 
i told you he d come 
two things became clear 
hanging myself from edinburgh s flagpole
is preferable to letting that parasite
plunder my talent a day longer 
i must complete my sextet 
i can t do it here  so tonight
i plan to make my escape 
please stand by for vehicle scan 
clearance granted 
any jailbreak s a risky proposition 
one little cock up  and we are
dangling at her majesty s pleasure 
i know  i know 
we could use code names 
but the truth is i d probably
be the first to forget mine 
so  mr  cavendish   
ernie blancksmith 
this is mr  meeks and my
girl veronica costello 
  to trust    to trust 
i know  i know 
what about the parrot  then 
forever those are likely songbird 
mr  meeks is a fine and honorable
gentleman  he would never betray us 
besides  no one s ever
heard him say anything else 
i know  i know 
question is  old man 
think you re up to snuff 
unanimity requires compliance 
we have a security code
red  prepare to be boarded 
what are you going to do 
stay calm  stay calm 
  it will end in tears 
  you ve warned me 
i suppose i m as hopeless as adam ewing 
oblivious towards the unspeakable
forms lying and waiting 
blind to the fact his
friend is poisoning him 
wait  please   
the idea of losing this ring
distresses me beyond measure 
don t be a silly puff here  adam 
i m sure your wife will set
your health above a golden loop 
i have seen the onset for dropsy
and it is not a pretty sight 
i know an excellent spanish goldsmith 
who works with such alacrity

  general apis      you  my dear

efforts were not in vain 
but    i m just a dinery server 
i was not genomed to alter reality 
no revolutionary ever was 
i m sorry 
i cannot do what you re asking 
it would be a difficult
choice for anyone 
but  before you call
your decision final 
there is one last thing
i would like you to see 
in order to fully understand
what we are fighting for 
cross your fingers n  toes 
if your pray  be answered 
nay prescients never
return to the valley again 
those wishin  to come
with us  they re welcome 
the valley is my home 
are you alright 
i know    it is forbidden 
sixsmith  i climb the steps of
the scot monument every morning 
and all becomes clear 
wish i could make you
see this brigthness 
don t worry  all is well 
all is so perfectly  damnably well 
i understand now  that boundaries
between noise and sound are conventions 
all boundaries are conventions 
waiting to be transcended 
one may trandcend any convention 
if only one can first
conceive of doing so 
moments like this  i can feel your heart
beating as clearly as i feel my own 
and i know that
separation is an illusion 
my life extends far beyond
the limitations of me 
storm is coming  mr  ewing 
gonna get you down below 
i m not running a fuckin 
charity  out with you  off you go 
aah  mr  ewing

dangerous times we have here 
about that scandal  they say that
ruffian robert frobisher is a composer 
you re a composer too 
aren t you mr  ewing 
  what d you want    the
constable asked to search my rooms 
i know how hard    you re working 
so i told him there s no
one on the third floor 
it costs quite a bit of money
to keep an entire floor empty 
  that s all i have    hmm   
what a beautiful    waistcoat 
if these letters are important 
  why d you keep reading
them    i don t know 
maybe i m    just trying
to understand something 
what 
why we keep making the same
mistakes  over and over 
maybe you should ask    megan 
  what    do you know a megan 
that s his niece  how do you know that 
looks like he mailed something to her 
probably used the envelope
he was keeping letters in 
come on  luisa  first
rule of mystery writing 
a good clue always
leads to another clue 
when the ghostly ordeal of timothy
cavendish is turned into a film 
i m thinking for the role of the
hero  one patch of laurence olivier
with a dash of michael caine 
who the hell is this

house  i m covering for dr  upward 
  ooh  is this about mother

i don t think that she s
gonna last the night 
unfortunately  it is an
unconvenient time for us 
do we really need to come right now 
no no  of course not  but she
did ask for you specifically 
and she seems quite
upset about her last will 
i ll be right there 
the plan was a series
of topling dominoes 
that had commenced with ernie
announcing my death to nurse noakes 
  i know  i know    shhh 
the entire ambush hinged
upon the silence of mr  meeks 
  i know  i know    shh 
mr  cavendish 
everything alright 
  don t leave me here    shh 
mr  cavendish 
  and yet  mr  cavendish  the
rule      you temp temperous witch 
mr  hotchkiss  your mother is my
dearest friend here  do please hurry 
and so    adieu

oh  let me hazard a guess 
something in the key of
 oh henry  how could you do this to me 
i thought we were friends  
oh  unfortunately  you re wrong 
wrong like horrox and
your silly father in law 
there is only one rule that binds
all people  one governing principle
that defines every relationship
on god s green earth 
 the weak are meat and
the strong do eat   
that way

general wanted me to see 
the end rushes towards
me  unable to eat or sleep 
like ewing  the  mortal
coil  has become a noose 
i d rather become music 
they believe they re
going to exultation 
but they are not  are they 
welcome to exultation 
take a seat 
just relax 
this is to remove your collar 
 enemy s sleepin  
don t slit that throat 
the genomics industry demands a huge
quantity of biomatter for wombtanks 
and more importantly to sustain
their engineered labor force 
recycled fabricants are
a cheap source of protein 
soap 
they feed us to ourselves 
that ship   
the ship must be destroyed 
yes 
the systems that built
them must be turned down 
yes 
no matter if we re born in a tank
or a womb  we are all pureblood 
yes 
we must all fight   
and if necessary  die
to teach people the truth 
this is what we have been waiting for 
it s done 
you were then taken to a
union control satellite link 
i broadcast my revelation to the twelve
states and four off world colonies 
18 minutes later  the
enforcers attacked 
to be is to be perceived 
and so to know thyself is only
possible through the eyes of the other 
the nature of our immortal lives
is in the consequences
of our words and deeds 
that go on and are pushing
themseves throughout all time 
hide 
from good chief  now you re meat 
  catkin      uncle zach 
thanks  zachry 
no  thank you 
com on  mr  ewing  one more 
one more  salt clean out your stomach 
close  com on mr  ewing  com on 
do you see where we are  mr  ewing 
home 
megan sixsmith 
make them pay 
you can count on it 
thank you 
my uncle was a scientist 
but    he believed that love was real 
a kind of    natural phenomenon 
he believed that love
could outlive death 
i finished it in a frenzy that reminded
me of our last night in cambridge 
watched my final sunrise 
enjoyed the last cigarette 
didn t think the view
could be anymore perfect 
until i saw that beat up trilby 
honestly  sixsmith  as ridiculous
as that thing makes you look 
i don t believe i ve ever
seen anything more beautiful 
watched you for as long as i dared 
i don t believe it was a
fluke that i saw you first 
  okay    thank you 
captain saysoed he take you with us 
  i wanna go with
meronym    go    go where 
prescients in the same boat as
all us  got no home neitherwise 
nay  not yet 
you think someone will gonna hear
your prayer  come down from the sky 
perhaps   
perhaps one day 
one day ain t but a flea o  hope 
yay  and fleas ain t so easy to rid 
i believe there is another
world waiting for us  sixsmith 
a better world 
and i ll be waiting for you there 
may i help you  sir 
yes  thank you  i i m looking for
a friend who came to edinburg   
i believe we do not stay dead long 
find me beneath the corsican
stars where we first kissed 
yours eternally  r f 
the report said commander
zheng was killed in the assault 
that is correct 
but you say that you loved him 
yes i do 
you mean you are still in love with him 
i mean that i will always be 
our lives are not our own 
from womb to tomb 
we re bound to others 
past and present 
and by each crime and every kindness 
rebirth our future 
in your revelation  you spoke of the
consequences of an undividual s life
replicated throughout eternity 
does this mean that you
believe in an afterlife 
no heaven or hell 
i believe this is only a door 
when its closes  another opens 
if i can t imagine heaven 
i would imagine a thorough hope 
and behind it 
i will find him there  waiting for me 
my love 
oh god  i missed you so much 
thank you  sir 
if i may ask one last question   
you had to know this union
scheme was doomed to fail 
yes 
and why did you agree to it 
this is what general apis asked of me 
what  to be executed 
if i had remained invisible 
the truth would stay hidden 
i couldn t allow that 
and what if no one believes this truth 
someone already does 
adam  good god   
i have just been recounting
your astonishing adventure 
please  join us  give him a chair 
no no  thank you 
i cannot stay 
what are you doing here  has not the
doctor said at least three weeks in bed 
he did  but this couldn t wait 
i need to speak with
you  sir  privately 
of course 
is that the contract
from reverend horrox 
  it is indeed    well  you
know i could have sent a boy 
are you insane  
i owe my life to a self freed slave 
and i cannot in good conscience participate
in this kind of business any longer 
this would make such a good book 
i ll drink to that 
outside  fat snow flakes are falling
on slate roofs and granite walls 
like solzhenitsyn laboring in
vermont  i shall beaver away in exile 
unlike solzhenitsyn  i shan t be alone 
goddamn you  sir  if you were
not my daughter s husband   
hello  father 
tilda 
what s going on 
i ve come to say goodbye 
goodbye  where are you going 
we re moving back east  to
work with the abolitionists 
what 
that poison has rotted your brain 
oh yes  i highly recommend it 
i ve not felt that good in years 
tilda  i forbid you from going
anywhere with this mad man 
i ve been afraid of you
my whole life  father 
i m going with my husband 
adam 
listen to me   
for the sake of my
grandson  if not your own   
there is a natural order to this world 
and those who try to
upend it do not fare well 
this movement will never survive 
if you join them  you and your
entire family will be shunned 
at best  you exist as paria 
to be spat on and beaten 
at worst  lynched or crucified 
and for what 
for what 
no matter what you do  it will
never amount to anything more
than a single drop in a limitless ocean 
what is an ocean but
a multitude of drops 
fire is dyin
