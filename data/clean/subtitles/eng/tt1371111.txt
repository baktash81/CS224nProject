full of voices
ancestry howlin at you
yibberin stories
all voices tied up into one
one voice different
one voice
whisperin out there
spyin from the dark
that fangy devil
ol georgie himself
now you hear up close
and ill yarn you about
the first time we met
eye to eye
and thus it was when i made the
acquaintance of dr henry goose
the man i hoped might
cure me of my afflictions
have you lost something
question one
what secret in sixsmith report
would be worth killing for
question two
is it reasonable to believe that they
would kill again to protect that secret
and if so question three
what the fuck am i doing here
while my extensive
experience as an editor
has lead me to a disdain for flashbacks
and flash forwards and
all such tricksy gimmicks
i believe that if you dear reader
can extend your patience
for a just a moment
you will find there is a
method to this tale of madness
my dearest sixsmith
i shot myself through the
roof of my mouth this morning
with vivian ayres luger
a true suicide is a paced
disciplined certainty
people pontificate
suicide is a cowards act
couldnt be further from the truth
suicide takes tremendous courage
any problem sir you
just hit this button
thank you
on behalf of my ministry
and the future of unanimity
i would like to thank you
for this final interview
hello  press pass
expecting trouble
i was dermot hoggins publisher
not his shrink or his astrologer
and the ruddy bloody truth is
i had no idea what the man
was gonna do that night
this beach was once a
cannibals banqueting hall
where the strong gorged on the weak
but the teeth sir they spat out
like you and i would
expel a cherry stone
do you know the price a quarter
pound of these will earn
remember this is not an
interrogation or a trial
your version of the
truth is all that matters
truth is singular
its versions are mistruths
dont let them say i
killed myself for love
had my infatuations but
we both know in our hearts
who is the sole love of
my short bright life

there you are mr ewing
as binding a covenant there
can ever be between men
outside the province of scripture
thank you reverend horrox i
know my fatherinlaw is
profoundly excited about this deal
haskell moore is a great man
future generations
depend on men like him
men capable of speaking the truth
quite
when i first encountered
haskell moores writing
its perspicuity stroke me as though
delivered through divine revelation
the learned doctor here and i
already spent many a night
debating mr moores tractus
im only willing to conceive
that he makes a compelling case
as to why we are sitting here
enjoying this divine lamb
while kupaka stands
there contempt to serve
indeed ainit uh kupaka
you enjoy your life
here with us do you not
oh yes reverend sir
kupaka very happy here
see you see this is moores
ladder of civilization
the reason behind this natural order
please giles do shut up
ive been listening
to this for weeks i
would love to know what his own
soninlaw has to say about it
lets see
it is an inquiry concerning
gods will and the nature of men
and what does he have to say
about the nature of women
im afraid thats a subject he
prefers to pass by in silence
he wouldnt be the first
uh prey mr ewing continue
well uh the question
he does pose is
if god created the world how do
we know what things we can change
and what things must remain
sacred and inviolable
reverend horrox real
specific how to run plantation
georgian way best way he say
god this heat is unbearable
how do they take it
reverend horrox say
slaves like camel bred for desert
he say they not feel
heat like civilized folk
now we should get you out of the sun
now what what is that noise
ah there you are  what happened
it is as i suspected
gusano coco cervello
better known as the polynesian worm
once saw a mans brain after
the worm had finished with him
maggoty cauliflower ooph
but have no fear this particular
devil and i are well acquainted
here we go ah yes yes all gone
i
i dont know what i would have done had our paths not crossed
well for starters you would have died
i i shall find a way to repay you
oh unnecessary i assure
you i am a doctor adam
a tiger cannot change its stripes
cambridge 1936
sixsmith i do hope you will be able
to find it in your heart to forgive me
mr frobisher
mr robert frobisher
the management would like a
word with you please sir
mr frobisher open this door please
i do know youre in there
mr frobisher please comply
a letter is being drafted
to your father sir
mr frobisher
hated leaving you like that
wasnt the goodbye i had in mind
by the time you read this i
will be on my way to edinburgh
on my way to fame and fortune
i know you havent heard
of him but trust me
vivian ayres is one of the
musical greats sixsmith
the tragedy is that he hasnt produced
any new work in years due to illness
my scheme is to persuade him
to hire me as his amanuensis
and aid him in the
creation of a masterpiece
before shooting up through
the musical firmament
eventually obliging
pater to admit that yes
the son he disinherited is none
other than robert frobisher
the greatest british
composer of his time
i know sixsmith you groan and
shake your head but you smile too
which is why i love you
ps
thanks for the waistcoat
i needed something of
yours to keep me company
st george and the dragon
reminds me that composing is a crusade
sometimes you slay the dragon
sometimes the dragon slays you
alright then
frobisher is it
i trust mackerras told
you enough to be useful
ive had this little melody for viola
rattling about my head for months
lets see if you can get it down
subtle grace note before the third
soft and simple got it
now it gets interesting
good
play that back
would love to sir
um what key are we in
what key g minor of course
and the time signature
for christs sake
did you hear it or not
just just need a
little more time  you need
my dear boy who is
working for whom here
i apologize sir  are you
an amanuensis or an apologist
now pay attention
threefour changes to
fourfour on fourth bar
and back to threefour on bar five
if you can count that high
crotchet g pause for a quaver repeat
g quaver then eflat on the down beat
and so on
alright let me hear you
stop please youre hurting me
you must have misheard me i
said i had a melody not a malady
vivian
jocasta deliver me
whats going on in here
an exercise in futility
should i be introduced
theres really no point the
boy is useful as the clap
fortunately hell be
much easier to get rid of
would you be a dear and get
henry to show the boy out
yes of course darling
thats beautiful
yes
thats it thats my melody
san francisco 1973

dont know if its a past life

hell you think you are

column for a fucking rag

an occupational hazard
you were interviewing him
yeah for spyglass magazine
luisa rey
rufus sixsmith
rey
you wouldnt happen to be related
to the journalist lester rey
yeah he was my father
really he must have been
enormously proud of you
following in his footsteps  hmm
thats her my niece megan
shes lovely
born physicist with a better mind
for mathematics than i ever had
did her phd at cambridge
a woman at caius
gives you hope for the world
its hot
and were still here
thats a very peculiar birthmark
yeah my little comet
my mother was sure it was cancer
she wanted me to get it removed but
dont know i kinda like it
i knew someone who had
a birthmark that was
similar to that  really
who was it
someone i cared about very much
a uh a hypothetical
question for you miss rey
as a journalist
what price would you pay
to protect the source
any
prison
if it came to that yes
would you be prepared to
compromise your safety
my father braved
boobytrapped marshes and
the wrath of generals for
his journalistic integrity
what kind of daughter would i be if i
bailed when things got a little tough
saved
taxi
you sure you dont need a
cab  no ive got my car

london 2012
it was the night of the lemon prizes
and in its two lead forced duality
i recall a moment of introspection
why why would anyone in their
right mind choose to be a publisher
this was the precise
moment that dermot found me
oy timothy  aah dermot
bad news inexorably does
fockin waste
never forget herman melville
writes a ripping yarn about a big white
whale which is summarily dismissed
and yet today it is lugged
around in the backpacks
of every serious student
of literature in the world
i dont give a fock what
happens when im dead
i want people to buy me book now
well as your publisher obviously
nothing would make me happier
but sadly for whatever reason
knuckle sandwich has yet
to connect to its audience
you want a reason
ill give you a reason
right there  aah
you mean mr finch
felix fockin finch
that cunt that shat all over me
book in his poncy fockin magazine
it wasnt that bad  no
mr hoggins should apologize to the
trees failed for the making of his
bloated autobio novel four
hundred vainglorious pages
expire in an ending that is
flat and inane beyond belief
steady now dermot what is a
critic but one who reads quickly
arrogantly but never wisely
fock it
dermot
ladies and gentlemen
we have an additional award
tonight fellow book faeries
an award for most eminent critic
mr oh beg pardon
sir felix finch o b and e
and what might my prize be i wonder
a signed copy of an
unpulped knuckle sandwich
cant be many of those left
well
just what does that leadless
pencil you call an imagination
have in mind to end this scene hmm
i think youre gonna love this one
now thats an ending that
is flat ninane beyond belief
my thoughts
if im honest i admit that
the obvious emotions like shock
and horror flew as
finch had here and gone
tequila couple of fingers
while deep down i
experienced a nascent sense
of a silver lining to
this most tragic turn
overnight dermot dusty hoggins
became a cult hero to the common man
knuckle sandwich shifted ninety
thousand copies in less than two months
i was for the briefest
of moments cinderella
and all memory of past misfortune
receded in the rearview mirror
of my dream come true
what the fuck  timotee
cavendish oy presume
caught wi your cacks down
uh my office hours are
eleven to two and my secretary
would be more than happy to schedule
an appointment if you so desire
friends like us dont need appointments
we like it all cozy like this
visited dermot in the joint
our brothers got a question for you
wheres our focking money
boys boys look here
dermot signed what we call a
copyright transfer contract
which means that legally
dermot didnt sign a fockin contract
for the event of a fockin season
er perhapperhaps er we
could moot a provisional sum
as a basis for ongoing negotiation
okeydokey
what sum we gonna moot
fifty k will do for starters
fifty sounds reasonable
tomorrow afternoon
tomorrow afternoon
cash  no bullocks
no checks  old fashioned money
gentlemen
the law says  the law
whatd the law do for
felix fockin finch
neo seoul 2144
ordinarily i begin by asking prisoners
to recall their earliest memories
to provide a context for the
corporatic historians of the future
fabricants have no such
memories archivist
one twentyfour hour cycle in papa
songs is identical to every other
may i say you speak
consumer surprisingly well
it is unfortunate that the officials of
the unanimity can only speak one language
as an officer of unanimity i am of
course restricted from using sub speak
of course
please describe a typical
twentyfour hour papa song cycle
at hour four each server
is woken by autostimulin
from revival we
proceed to the hygiener
after dressing we file into the dinery
at hour five we man our stations
to greet the new days consumers
welcome to papa songs
for the next nineteen hours we
input orders tray food vend drinks
upstock condiments wipe
tables and bin garbage
all done in strict
adherence to first catechism
what is the first catechism
honor thy consumer
after the final cleaning
we imbibe one soap sack
and return to our sleep box
that is the blueprint
of every single day
did you ever think about the future
papa song servers have
just one possible future
you mean exultation
could you describe this
annual rite of passage
on first day seer rhee would
stamp a star on each of our collars
twelve stars meant an
end to our contract
how did you feel when you watched
one of your sisters ascend
excitement
i was happy for them
but envious as well
did your sister servers feel as you did
most of them
i would like to ask about
the infamous yoona939
if yoona939 woke you who woke her
seer rhee
why would seer wake a server
perhaps you should ask him archivist
whats wrong with him
he drinks soap
it makes him happy
then he sleep like us in our box
do you ever think about what it must
be like up there with the consumers
third catechism forbids such questions
yes it does
come let me show you a secret
platform four lost and found

this is a violation of the
ruddy incarceration act

bear away boy  aye aye captain
friday the 15th we made
sail with the morning tide
mr boerhaave had my cabin changed
i have been quarantined to a store room
away from the other passengers and crew
henry argued in vain that the
polynesian worm was not contagious
not that it matters
all i want to do now is return home
and unburden myself
from this responsibility
my dear sixsmith i am in
desperate need of your help
after my last letter im sure
youre rushing to pack your bags
but you neednt really
unless of course you wish to witness
the rebirth of robert frobisher
is it not miraculous how ones fortune
can turn so quickly so completely
one moment leaping from
a hotel window the next
gainfully employed by one of the
worlds greatest living composers
my only problem is that i
accidentally got hooked on a journal
written in 1849 by a dying
lawyer during the voyage
from the pacific
islands to san francisco
to my great annoyance the
pages cease midsentence
half the book is missing
its completely getting me
could you be a mensch and
when youre next foraging
at ottos books make an inquiry
a half finished book is after
all a half finished love affair
america loves oil
america is addicted to oil
some fantasize about
wind turbines or peat gas
but im here today to
tell you that the cure
for oil is right here
the cure is nuclear power
the cure is swannekke
hello miss rey im frightfully
sorry for calling you at this hour
dr sixsmith
i need help
i need  50000 not 2000 50000
im going through it again mr
cavendish but the totals right
2343 pounds and 16 pence
how is this possible the
ruddy money was pouring in
debts mostly mr cavendish
solvency has its drawbacks
the situation looked dire
but i knew that timothy
cavendishs capital in this town
could not be defined by an
accountants balance sheet
mccluskie
look how are those
delightful kiddies of yours
mon cher tis cavendish the
ravenous your favorite timothy
mon cher
you heard it correctly
charles dickens own original
authentic writing desk for
60000 i think thats very fair
but our records indicate that
the desk is already accounted for
by the dickens house museum
okay what about sir
arthur conan doyles desk
in the darkness i
suddenly saw the light
blood has always trumped water
if the hogginses brutes wanted
to turn this into a family affair
theyd find the cavendish clan more
than ready for the task at hand
oh satans gonads not again look
just bugger off and leave us in peace
im only gonna asking you nicely once
good to see you denny
im not lending you a ruddy farthing
until you pay back the last lot
whywhy should i be forever
giving you a hand out
denny

with the wrong sort
if i dont get my hands on  60000
i got to get an awful beating
well get them to video it for
us would you now fuck off

perfect place for you to hide
i begun to fear i might never hold
my beloved tilda in her arms again
my parasite writhes at night
igniting spasms of pain
while visions and voices
obscene and monstrous haunt me
mister ewing
in the name of god
mister ewing no fear

you know i
what do you want
you help mr ewing
if you no help i in trouble dead

much in trouble dead
the prophetess is a mercantile vessel

the same is true you know it
im be no fish food mr ewing
die here better do it
do it quick
i found an old transway marker captain
its got to be the red mountain
the problem is the valley
people are afraid of it
they think the devil lives up there
i cant find anybody to guide
me through the kona territory
meronym
every day youre out there
you increase your odd levels
this dream of yours is going
to kill you and for what
the offworld colonies
may no longer exist
i got to go captain
thank you for coming im in 1404
ill be right up
dr sixsmith
its me luisa
go call the police right
now call the police
my dear sixsmith you alone can
understand how im feeling right now
today ayrs and i presented our first
collaboration to tadeusz kesselring
ayrs favorite conductor
who arrived from berlin
its called eternal recurrence
wish you could hear it
its the most accomplished tone
poem i know of written since the war
and i tell you sixsmith
that more than of the few
of its best ideas are mine
at our time of life ayrs a man
has no right to such daring ideas
i suppose ive won a rearguard action
or two in my war against decrepitude
diner of pheasant with
bordeaux rich as buttercream
how i love to listen to
men of distinguished lives
sing of past follies and glories
the only broken note in the entire
evening was ayrs wife jocasta
excusing herself early
sensed the buried bone
later i asked ayrs about it
he said kesselring had
introduced jocasta to him
i pried had kesselring
been in love with her
the subject was a prickly one
jocasta is a jew
obviously her relationship
was impossible
why obviously
can you really be so ignorant
of what is happening in germany
at this point in my life
all i know sixsmith
is that this world spins
from the same unseen forces
that twist our hearts
how is it mr zachry  thin whiles
minding some company  nay
but
goats and so do herders
theyre known for housin temper
feelin that own n
your reveal count out
for invadin your house with no saysoe
true sorrysome
well it now its done
so you mindin a stranger
coverin about your thrivin
swap you query for query
fair buy
cog you and come dow learn
stitchin n milkin our heardin
why you here
i needin a guide
guide to where
mauna sol
bridge is broken hide below
whats wrong
we cross and recross our old
tracks like figure skaters
and just as i was
reading a new submission
a powerful déjàvu
ran through my bones
i had been there before
another lifetime ago
ursula
the love of my life
i could think of no
other serious applicants
what had happened to her
and more importantly
what had happened to the young man
who had ridden the same
train composing sonnets
to his so bound a love
your augurin come true abbess
broke bridge just like you say
meronym wa there yeb her
aback trackin up mauna sol
why can this prescient woman come
cursin n twistin on my life
mind the words of sonmi
our lives are not our own
from womb to tomb we
are bound to others
past and present
and by each crime
and every kindness
rebirth our future
welcome to neo seoul
come on out you come
this maybe the biggest
mistake of my life but here
thank you mr ewing
now to tell the truth i was
worried you might try and eat me
if you didnt get
something in the stomach
oh you safe mr ewing
i no like white meat
ah right
before i decide what
im going to do with you
tell me why you were
being whipped so savagely
my uncle was a sailor
he took me on a french whaler
when i was ten years old
seen too much of the world
i no good slave
why did you look at me
pain strong right
friends eye more strong
look you are a runaway
slave and i am a lawyer
how did you imagine we
could possibly be friends
all you need
ah jesus
javier gomez what did i tell
you about jumping onto my balcony
why dyou leave the door open
if you dont want me to come in
because smarty pants
the only thing worse than having
you jumping onto my balcony
is the idea of you jumping onto my
balcony and being stuck out there
okay
what are you reading
old letters
sixsmith the plot has
taken a sensual turn
last week jocasta and i became lovers
but dont alarm yourself it is only
a carnal act performed in service
not unlike my role as amanuensis
and i confess womens hearts like
their desire remain a mystery to me
afterward she cried and thanked me
for bringing life back into their home
i can get clear that vivian
had been there the entire night
between us like the silence between
notes that holds the key to warm music
best news of all
ive started my own work
uh i called about an old recording
written by a man named robert frobisher
oops passed it
i know i shouldnt be
pulling it i was
checking it to make
sure it wasnt scratched
but honestly
i just cant stop listening to it
this is the cloud atlas sextet
its the symphony
its beautiful
but i think ive heard this before
i cant imagine how
i doubt theres no more than a handful
copies in the whole of north america
but i know it
i know i know it
before i realized it my feet had brought
me back to the temple of sacrifice
where i offered up my virginity
back to those fourdays of paradise
when ursulas mater and
pater slift off to greece
for a long weekend
or so we thought
ursula
naked
sir madam i assure you
this is completely innocent
two sprained ankles one cracked rib
official cause of accident
listed on hospital form
pussy
what were the chances that
she still lived in this house
and yet there she was
ursula
why had i never returned
her calls or letters
shame spinessless hallmarks
of the cavendish clan
i realized i had a choice i could
slink off and continue as planned
or i could go boldly to the door
and discover what hope
if any would lay within
abbess come quick
its the bailey girl
catkin  aye she dyin
whatwhat  zach
sonmi  its scorpion fish
healer said she be gone by sundown
aint right aint fair
but nothing to be done
be very still

haeju
sir zheng  please

demands some courage
knowledge is a mirror and
for the first time in my life
i was allowed to see who i
was and who i might become
go clean the head
good morning captain
youre the hell that remains
old quail cock by buggering off
im afraid i cant do it sir
if i was i would be unable
to inform you of the stowaway
that i have discovered
in my  stowaway
i assure you that this
moriori had no choice
now he has sworn to me that he is
a first class able bodied seaman
capable of earning passage
if only given a chance
stowaway hes a stowaway
even if he shits silver nuggets
did he ever explain anything to you
he told me their goal was the
creation of a free willed fabricant
yoona had failed
i was their last hope
i have to say if all lady
journalists look like you
i might start to take this uh
womens lib thing more seriously
well im sure they can use your sort
nice
okay uh you wait here and i will
go find someone smarter who can uh
walk you through the details

i have been a principal investor
in aurora house for twelve years

i think its high time you put an
end to this little game of yours
no no no timmy
my fun has just begun
what are you talking about
i am your brother why
are you doing this to me
i think the better question iswould
be what have you done to deserve this
i dont know what you mean
oh come naughty old
brother dont insult me
you cant think that i didnt
know about you and georgette
georgette
look den
i didnt mean to hurt you
im afraid your penance

no need to apologize
your exile is more
than enough reparation
oh i do have my fingers crossed
for a scenario involving you
nurse noakes and a broom handle
cherry up timmy bye bye now
he sends his love
i would like to ask about
the night of your arrest
i remember listening
to his heart beat
your heart beats much slower than ours
there is a gentleness to the sound
i find it comforting
vivian what time is it
i dont know who cares
ive heard a melody boy for violin
quick
findfind a pen
i heard it in a dream it
was in a nightmarish café
blurry bright lights but
underground and no way out
and the waitresses
they all had the same face
there was music played not like
any music ive ever heard in my life
it began it began
wait
it was so clear a minute ago
help me robert help
me its slipping away
ive lost it
itll come to you sir
the minute you stop trying
to find it it will find you
you are naive robert
i am anything but
there is a gulf between these chairs
what you want is no
different from what i want
the gulf is an illusion
how do i describe
that night sixsmith
what had happened between vivian
and i transcended language
it was music that poured from his
eyes and breathed from his lips
music as beautiful as
any i have ever heard
whatwhat are you doing in here
they found us
ill be with you the
whole way now focus on me
stay with me
right here i wont let you go
mr ewing  itits alright
i
i talked to the captain hell hear your case
whats your name boy
autua sir
the christian gentlemen
who knows nothing about ships
tells me that youre
a firstclass sailor
very well lets see youd
lower the main top son
mr roderick my bottle is empty
mr boerhaave ready my piece
what sir you gave
me your word captain
p
please you cant do this
nobody tells me what i can
and cannot do on my own ship
specially when it
concerns nigger stowaway
captain look hes got
fishhooks for toes
boerhaave you dont
make a mess of my deck
captain please
look if you can just hear me im
the darkies salt as i am
mr boerhaave
it appears we have an
addition to our crew
make sure he earns his keep
mr hooks
i found her she was in the chem
labs looking for the bathroom
ah well perfect then uh why
dont you take over from here sachs
you know introduce our
little tribe and uh
and guide ms rey through
the through the tower
the funny thing is i am
not even supposed to be here
i was meant to be in seoul but
the air traffic controller strike
put everything up so now im
on the time jumper tonight
did you ever think that the
universe was against you
all the time
you mind
im cool
you seem nervous isaac
do i make you nervous  no
actually just the opposite
will you gonna tell me
why you covered for me
freedom the fatuous
jingle of our civilization
but only those deprived of it have the
barest inkling of what it really is
theres much disagreement on
what should be done with you
the corprocrats want you
euthanased as a deviant
the manufacturer is
demanding a period of study
the pyschogenomicists are screaming
for an immediate cerebral vivisection
however the problem you
create is a political one
which means you are my problem
i find it intriguing to
imagine that beneath this
perfectly engineered features are thoughts
that terrify the whole of unanimity
im not afraid of such thoughts
because i do not fear the truth
theres a natural order
to this world fabricant
and the truth is this
order must be protected
inform the archivist
prepare for excisement
yes sir  sir
can you tell me what
happened to haeju zheng
killed i was told
all this feast and excitements
really adam its
all too much youll need to rest
i had
a girlfriend once she kept trying
to get me to read carlos castenada
you ever read any of
that stuff  oh yeah
but the relationship was doomed
every time she brought up a new
karma that sort of stuff i
i couldnt stop myself from laughing
and yet
i cant explain
that i knew when i opened that door
they destroyed most of
the copies of the report
most
theres no good choice here is there
if i help you i close my job
or worse
if i dont a lot of people
and it will be worse than worse
you have to do
whatever you cant not do
someone preyin on you zachry
you really aint feary about
meetin ol georgie on the summit
im more scaresome bout the
weather than in the devil
you cog hes real
who tripped the fall
if not old georgie
truetrue
the old uns
thats just a rope osmoke
old uns got the smart
they mastered sick and seeds
they make miracles
and fly across the sky
true all true but
they got somethin else
a hunger in their hearts a hunger
thats stronger than all their smart
hunger for what
a hunger for more
belief like fear or love
is forced to be understood as we
understand the theory of relativity
and principles of uncertainty
phenomena that determine
the course of our lives
yesterday my life was
headed in one direction
today it is headed in another
yesterday i believe i would
never have done what i did today
these forces that often
remake time and space
they can shape and alter who
we imagine ourselves to be
begin long before we are born
and continue after we perish
our lives and our choices
like quantum trajectories are
understood moment to moment
at each point of
intersection each encounter
suggest a new potential direction
proposition
i have fallen in love with luisa rey
is this possible i
just met her and yet
i feel like something
important has happened to me
thats it
the music from my dream
this is from my dream that
night i came to your room
this is the music i heard in my
head somehow i gave it to you
ive been working on
this piece for weeks now
i suspect you heard it and
incorporated it into your dream
i call it the cloud atlas sextet
this is obviously the
result of our collaboration
the atlas i believe
is the only thing ive done
in my life that is of value
but i know i could not have written it
if i hadnt met you
there are whole movements in the
atlas that ive read imagining us
meeting again and again in
different lives and different ages
yes
something as important as this cannot
be described as yours or mine
it is ours
that this is exactly how i feel vivian
im sorry i
i thought  you
thought you thought what
that i might fancy a little buggering
from a fine young dandy like yourself
i pack my bag and be gone by morning
youll do no such thing youll
leave only when i say you can leave
you will continue working
on vivian ayres cloud atlas
when it is finished then i
will decide what you do with you
you cant keep me here im leaving
good luck with your composing im
sure a sterile old fuck like yourself
is still capable of something
completely unmemorable
i suggest you think about this
robert think about reputation
reputation is everything in our society
yours my disinherited reprobate
has expired
did you not think that we would inquire
about someone living under our roof
mackerras himself wrote and i quote
he is a prostitute whose liaisons
with perverts and sodomites
were common place in his brief
and forgettable career at caius
lock up the silverware  end of quote
be warned leave here
without my consent
and all the musical society will know
of the degenerate robert frobisher
after that
even if you compose one of the
greatest symphonies ever written
no one will hear it
because no one will want
anything to do with you
i wont let you go again
i told you hed come
two things became clear
hanging myself from edinburghs flagpole
is preferable to letting that parasite
plunder my talent a day longer
i must complete my sextet
i cant do it here so tonight
i plan to make my escape
please stand by for vehicle scan
clearance granted
any jailbreaks a risky proposition
one little cockup and we are
dangling at her majestys pleasure
i know i know
we could use code names
but the truth is id probably
be the first to forget mine
so mr cavendish
ernie blancksmith
this is mr meeks and my
girl veronica costello
to trust  to trust
i know i know
what about the parrot then
forever those are likely songbird
mr meeks is a fine and honorable
gentleman he would never betray us
besides no ones ever
heard him say anything else
i know i know
question is old man
think youre up to snuff
unanimity requires compliance
we have a security code
red prepare to be boarded
what are you going to do
stay calm stay calm
it will end in tears
youve warned me
i suppose im as hopeless as adam ewing
oblivious towards the unspeakable
forms lying and waiting
blind to the fact his
friend is poisoning him
wait please
the idea of losing this ring
distresses me beyond measure
dont be a silly puff here adam
im sure your wife will set
your health above a golden loop
i have seen the onset for dropsy
and it is not a pretty sight

im sorry
i cannot do what youre asking

choice for anyone
but before you call
your decision final
there is one last thing
i would like you to see
in order to fully understand
what we are fighting for
cross your fingers n toes
if your pray be answered
nay prescients never
return to the valley again
those wishin to come
with us theyre welcome
the valley is my home
are you alright
i know it is forbidden
sixsmith i climb the steps of
the scot monument every morning
and all becomes clear
wish i could make you
see this brigthness
dont worry all is well
all is so perfectly damnably well
i understand now that boundaries
between noise and sound are conventions
all boundaries are conventions
waiting to be transcended
one may trandcend any convention
if only one can first
conceive of doing so
moments like this i can feel your heart
beating as clearly as i feel my own
and i know that
separation is an illusion
my life extends far beyond
the limitations of me
storm is coming mr ewing
gonna get you down below
im not running a fuckin
charity out with you off you go
aah mr ewing
aaa word if you may
dangerous times we have here

ruffian robert frobisher is a composer
youre a composer too
arent you mr ewing
what dyou want  the
constable asked to search my rooms
i know how hard youre working
so i told him theres no
one on the third floor
it costs quite a bit of money
to keep an entire floor empty
thats all i have  hmm
what a beautiful waistcoat
if these letters are important
why dyou keep reading
them  i dont know
maybe im just trying
to understand something
what
why we keep making the same
mistakes over and over
maybe you should ask megan
what  do you know a megan
thats his niece how do you know that
looks like he mailed something to her
probably used the envelope
he was keeping letters in
come on luisa first
rule of mystery writing
a good clue always
leads to another clue

cavendish is turned into a film

hero one patch of laurence olivier

unconvenient time for us

no no of course not but she
did ask for you specifically
and she seems quite
upset about her last will
ill be right there
the plan was a series
of topling dominoes

announcing my death to nurse noakes

the entire ambush hinged
upon the silence of mr meeks
i know i know  shh

dont slit that throat
the genomics industry demands a huge
quantity of biomatter for wombtanks
and more importantly to sustain
their engineered labor force
recycled fabricants are
a cheap source of protein
soap
they feed us to ourselves
that ship
the ship must be destroyed
yes
the systems that built
them must be turned down
yes
no matter if were born in a tank
or a womb we are all pureblood
yes
we must all fight
and if necessary die
to teach people the truth
this is what we have been waiting for
its done
you were then taken to a
union control satellite link
i broadcast my revelation to the twelve
states and four offworld colonies
18 minutes later the
enforcers attacked
to be is to be perceived
and so to know thyself is only
possible through the eyes of the other
the nature of our immortal lives
is in the consequences
of our words and deeds
that go on and are pushing
themseves throughout all time
hide
from good chief now youre meat
catkin  uncle zach
thanks zachry
no thank you
comon mr ewing one more
one more salt clean out your stomach
close comon mr ewing comon
do you see where we are mr ewing
home
megan sixsmith
make them pay
you can count on it
thank you
my uncle was a scientist
but he believed that love was real
a kind of natural phenomenon
he believed that love
could outlive death
i finished it in a frenzy that reminded
me of our last night in cambridge
watched my final sunrise
enjoyed the last cigarette
didnt think the view
could be anymore perfect
until i saw that beatup trilby
honestly sixsmith as ridiculous
as that thing makes you look
i dont believe ive ever
seen anything more beautiful
watched you for as long as i dared
i dont believe it was a
fluke that i saw you first
okay  thank you
captain saysoed he take you with us
i wanna go with
meronym  go go where
prescients in the same boat as
all us got no home neitherwise
nay not yet
you think someone will gonna hear
your prayer come down from the sky
perhaps
perhaps one day
one day aint but a flea o hope
yay and fleas aint so easy to rid
i believe there is another
world waiting for us sixsmith
a better world
and ill be waiting for you there
may i help you sir
yes thank you iim looking for
a friend who came to edinburg
i believe we do not stay dead long
find me beneath the corsican
stars where we first kissed
yours eternally rf
the report said commander
zheng was killed in the assault
that is correct
but you say that you loved him
yes i do
you mean you are still in love with him
i mean that i will always be
our lives are not our own
from womb to tomb
were bound to others
past and present
and by each crime and every kindness
rebirth our future
in your revelation you spoke of the
consequences of an undividuals life
replicated throughout eternity
does this mean that you
believe in an afterlife
no heaven or hell
i believe this is only a door
when its closes another opens
if i cant imagine heaven
i would imagine a thorough hope
and behind it
i will find him there waiting for me
my love
oh god i missed you so much
thank you sir
if i may ask one last question
you had to know this union
scheme was doomed to fail
yes
and why did you agree to it
this is what general apis asked of me
what to be executed
if i had remained invisible
the truth would stay hidden
i couldnt allow that
and what if no one believes this truth
someone already does
adam good god
i have just been recounting
your astonishing adventure
please join us give him a chair
no no thank you
i cannot stay
what are you doing here has not the
doctor said at least three weeks in bed
he did but this couldnt wait
i need to speak with
you sir privately
of course
is that the contract
from reverend horrox
it is indeed  well you
know i could have sent a boy
are you insane
i owe my life to a selffreed slave
and i cannot in good conscience participate
in this kind of business any longer
this would make such a good book
ill drink to that
outside fat snow flakes are falling
on slate roofs and granite walls
like solzhenitsyn laboring in
vermont i shall beaver away in exile
unlike solzhenitsyn i shant be alone
goddamn you sir if you were
not my daughters husband
hello father
tilda
whats going on
ive come to say goodbye
goodbye where are you going
were moving back east to
work with the abolitionists
what
that poison has rotted your brain
oh yes i highly recommend it
ive not felt that good in years
tilda i forbid you from going
anywhere with this mad man
ive been afraid of you
my whole life father
im going with my husband
adam
listen to me
for the sake of my
grandson if not your own
there is a natural order to this world
and those who try to
upend it do not fare well
this movement will never survive
if you join them you and your
entire family will be shunned
at best you exist as paria
to be spat on and beaten
at worst lynched or crucified
and for what
for what
no matter what you do it will
never amount to anything more
than a single drop in a limitless ocean
what is an ocean but
a multitude of drops
fire is dyin
just as well my yawnin is done
no please granpi please

buggars comon its getting cold
