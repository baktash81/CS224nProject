would anyone like
to help him elaborate 
so  storytelling is a way for
people to explain
their world   
their culture   
passing on customs and beliefs
from one generation
to the next 
in america  and especially
here in oregon   
storytelling started with
our indigenous people 
native americans who were
teaching the younger people   
in their communities about
their culture and identities

of a fable or a myth

big bear used to take care
of the little bears 
but big bear got sick

one day 
little bear came home   
and big bear and baby bear
were different 
big bear s sickness
had gotten worse 
big bear has become
more angrier and meaner   
because they had no food 
no meat

so many     laughs nervously 
hey   
do you know frank weaver 
of course 
i ve cited him   
and revived him with narcan
more times than i can count 
why 
his son  uh 
is a student of mine 
that was his drawing 
i pulled it from the trash 
that makes sense  yeah 
every time i see him   
i expect to find frank dead
with a needle in his arm 
so why isn t he in jail 
i don t know 
i ve tried many times   
but he goes away 
who takes care of the boys 
after their mother died   
protective services felt
he was somehow
fit enough
to be their guardian 
and what can i say to that 
something is going on there 
first of all  it looks like
no one even lives there 
and when i got close   
you went to his house 
i thought i heard something
that did not sound normal 
you can t do that 
you can t go to
frank weaver s house   
 without telling me 
 i heard something 
and it was not normal 
do you understand 
you can t do that 
everyone thinks these problems
are just gonna go away   
and we know that they don t

 where did you get this 
 julia  his desk 
it s textbook  ellen 
emotional  physical   
ellen  hold on 
neither of us are experts
in diagnosing abuse 
but i hear you 
this is very disturbing 
but sadly 
lucas is not the only one
not getting the attention
he needs 
but he s here 
in a safe space 
what is that supposed to mean 
his younger brother 
why isn t he enrolled 
we ve had plenty of students
that are homeschooled 
and they re kept out
so they can move product
for their parents 
or so we don t
smell methamphetamine
on their clothes 
and turn their parents in 
okay  but regardless 
that is a cry for help 
take it from someone
who can diagnose abuse 
i tell you what 
next chance i get 
i will reach out
to his father 
cashier  here you go 
what can i do for ya 
sorry 
hey 
warren  i don t know  paul 
it was just   
the bottom half
was all chewed to hell 
damnedest thing i ever saw 
paul  all right  well   
we ll go take a look 
thank you  warren 
warren  thanks  sheriff 
what s going on 
he  uh  found a part of a man
in the woods today 
part of a man 
who is that 
you don t remember
sheriff stokes 
 when we were kids 
 yeah  i do 
yeah  he said he was  uh 
hiking up near greymouth   
when a stench led him   
to a man half buried
in the woods 
i guess the other half
was found in the mine 
near a meth lab 
it was probably
a bear or a cougar  something 
jesus 
well  from what
he just told me   
i don t think jesus was
anywhere to be found 
all right  we gotta get out
there and meet the coroner 
julia  hmm

dr  gerald  determining cause

about lucas 
 panting 
paul  you smell that 
daniel  yeah

paul 
frank  it s sheriff meadows 
fucking place

reporter 1     small town of
cispus falls  oregon 
rumors of another round
of gruesome attacks   
reporter 2 
   processing evidence
and provide
forensic expertise 
our attempts to contact
local law enforcement
have gone unanswered   
paul  have you spoken with
clint s parents this morning 
yes  they wanted to know if he
had been in school yesterday 
and he was here till
the end of the day  right 
 sniffles 
look  i know this has   
been difficult on all of us 
but right now  we have to work
under the assumption   
that this is just some
kind of a coincidence 
we ll find him 
we ll find him 
excuse me 
 what 
  whispers  a coincidence 
that my student
is now missing  too 
what the fuck  paul 
what else would you
like me to do  jules  hmm 
the warrant is being processed
right now  it takes time 
it doesn t just
happen overnight

paul  it s gotta be
frank weaver 
daniel 
yeah  the teeth will tell us 
looks like something
just burst out of him 
lucas  lucas  listen to me 
listen  i don t want
you to go in there 
 no  no  let me go 
 listen  i know  it s okay 
what s going on here 
well  needless to say 
i m concerned 
he s severely dehydrated 
suffers from
chronic malnourishment 
i recommend keeping him
overnight  possibly longer   
but i don t have to tell you
that he is
a deeply damaged boy 
could be the circumstances
or his genetic disposition   
but there are definite signs
of a psychiatric crisis here 
anti anxiety  anti psychotics
will be our friend   
but given what
he s just experienced   
paul  when do you think
i ll be able to interview him 
dr  francis 
well  not tonight  certainly 
what do you plan
on doing with him 
well  we re discussing that 
um   
but it s complicated 
dr  francis  oh  i m sure 
the little fella s
got a long road ahead of him 
i d be remiss
if i didn t mention   
but it s clear that he has
been subjected to abuse 
and for some time 
thank you  alan 
we can t  no 
he has no one 
we don t know
where the brother is 
so where s he gonna go 
i have no idea right now  but
he is not your responsibility 
he doesn t have a family 
and he s my student 
so he is my responsibility 
jules   
this is not about you 
this is about him 
and getting him the help   
what did you just say to me 
what did you just say to me 
don t put our past on him 
oh  i m sorry 
did he snap your arm in two 
did he force you to hide under
the floor of that kitchen   
praying he would
never come home 
you have no idea what he   
did you have to meet
his every fucking need 
because i don t remember that 
you have no idea
what he did to me 
 banging on door 
aiden  let us in 
daddy 
 daddy 
  gagging 
lucas  dad  please 
aiden  open the door  daddy 
guys  you have to
give me a second 
daddy s just sick 
aiden  daddy  daddy  please 
lucas  daddy  what s
happening to you 
 aiden  open the door 
 no 
  cries out 
 aiden  daddy 
 frank grunting 
look at me 
daddy is very  very sick 
you lock that fucking door 
no matter what i do 
you don t open that door 
you hear me 
lock it 
lock the door 
lucas 
daddy  aiden s very sick 
 frank grunting  growling 
 grunts in pain 
 banging on door 
 screaming 
 lucas continues screaming 
paul  if you wouldn t mind 
just telling me
what you make of these 
warren  hmm 
 breathes sharply 
where did you find this 
belongs to a student 
is the student native 
no 
how can that be 
julia  i don t know  he isn t 
 grunts 
this is what was in the mine 
this    is what
was in the mine 
it s the wendigo 
translates to   
a diabolical wickedness
that devours mankind 
according to legend  during
a brutally cold winter   
a lost hunter s severe hunger
drove him to cannibalism 
and after feasting on
human flesh   
he became crazed   
and transformed into
an amorphous spirit
that could take many forms 
and roamed the forest
for fresh victims 
his insatiable appetite
was never satisfied 
 paul chuckles 
excuse me  this is a myth
you re talking about 
for you  yeah 
but a cautionary tale
to the indigenous people
who believe in it 
they re elusive 
and known to
be eternally starving 
but feasting only
makes them hungrier 
and weaker 
those who are unfortunate
enough to encounter one   
can only kill it when it s
in its weakened state 
and only by extinguishing
its beating heart   
forcing it to search
for another host 
but it all makes sense 
you see 
i mean  our ancestral spirits
never died 
they were here
long before we were   
and they ll be here
long after we are gone 
but now  they re angry 
man   over radio  paul 
go for paul 
man  pumphouse road 
you gotta come by the tracks 
what  what happened 
man  we got a body out here 
it s bad  paul  it s real bad 
 police radio chatter

and we ll figure it out 
i ll call the mayor   
and we ll get out
in front of it 
i m sorry  i m not inclined
to believe anybody   
about some mythological
nature beast 
things like that
don t exist  jules 
regardless of
what stokes said 
there s a logical  reasonable
explanation for this 
so ellen booth   
and that    husk that you
pulled out of the weavers  
and what about lucas s
brother  where is he 
i don t know
