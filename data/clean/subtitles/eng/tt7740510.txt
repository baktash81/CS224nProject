would anyone like
to help him elaborate
so storytelling is a way for
people to explain
their world
their culture
passing on customs and beliefs
from one generation
to the next
in america and especially
here in oregon
storytelling started with
our indigenous people
native americans who were
teaching the younger people
in their communities about
their culture and identities

of a fable or a myth

hey
do you know frank weaver
of course
ive cited him
and revived him with narcan
more times than i can count
why
his son uh
is a student of mine
that was his drawing
i pulled it from the trash
that makes sense yeah
every time i see him
i expect to find frank dead
with a needle in his arm
so why isnt he in jail
i dont know
ive tried many times
but he goes away
who takes care of the boys
after their mother died
protective services felt
he was somehow
fit enough
to be their guardian
and what can i say to that
something is going on there
first of all it looks like
no one even lives there
and when i got close
you went to his house
i thought i heard something
that did not sound normal
you cant do that
you cant go to
frank weavers house
without telling me
i heard something
and it was not normal
do you understand
you cant do that
everyone thinks these problems
are just gonna go away
and we know that they dont
footsteps thudding
aiden lucas
lucas im hungry
knocks on door
aiden sobbing
twig snaps
flies buzzing
where did you get this
julia his desk
its textbook ellen
emotional physical
ellen hold on
neither of us are experts
in diagnosing abuse
but i hear you
this is very disturbing
but sadly
lucas is not the only one
not getting the attention
he needs
but hes here
in a safe space
what is that supposed to mean
his younger brother
why isnt he enrolled
weve had plenty of students
that are homeschooled
and theyre kept out
so they can move product
for their parents
or so we dont
smell methamphetamine
on their clothes
and turn their parents in
okay but regardless
that is a cry for help
take it from someone
who can diagnose abuse
i tell you what
next chance i get
i will reach out
to his father
cashier here you go
what can i do for ya
sorry
hey
warren i dont know paul
it was just
the bottom half
was all chewed to hell
damnedest thing i ever saw

in the woods today

who is that
you dont remember
sheriff stokes
when we were kids
yeah i do
yeah he said he was uh
hiking up near greymouth
when a stench led him
to a man half buried
in the woods
i guess the other half
was found in the mine
near a meth lab
it was probably
a bear or a cougar something
jesus
well from what
he just told me
i dont think jesus was
anywhere to be found
all right we gotta get out
there and meet the coroner

clints parents this morning
yes they wanted to know if he
had been in school yesterday
and he was here till
the end of the day right
sniffles
look i know this has
been difficult on all of us
but right now we have to work
under the assumption
that this is just some
kind of a coincidence
well find him
well find him
excuse me
what
whispers a coincidence
that my student
is now missing too
what the fuck paul
what else would you
like me to do jules hmm
the warrant is being processed

lucas lucas listen to me
listen i dont want
you to go in there
no no let me go
listen i know its okay
whats going on here
well needless to say
im concerned
hes severely dehydrated
suffers from
chronic malnourishment
i recommend keeping him
overnight possibly longer
but i dont have to tell you
that he is
a deeply damaged boy
could be the circumstances
or his genetic disposition
but there are definite signs
of a psychiatric crisis here
antianxiety antipsychotics
will be our friend
but given what
hes just experienced
paul when do you think
ill be able to interview him
dr francis
well not tonight certainly
what do you plan
on doing with him
well were discussing that
um
but its complicated
dr francis oh im sure
the little fellas
got a long road ahead of him
id be remiss
if i didnt mention
but its clear that he has
been subjected to abuse
and for some time
thank you alan
we cant no
he has no one
we dont know
where the brother is
so wheres he gonna go
i have no idea right now but
he is not your responsibility
he doesnt have a family
and hes my student
so he is my responsibility
jules
this is not about you
this is about him
and getting him the help
what did you just say to me
what did you just say to me
dont put our past on him
oh im sorry
did he snap your arm in two
did he force you to hide under
the floor of that kitchen
praying he would
never come home
you have no idea what he
did you have to meet
his every fucking need
because i dont remember that
you have no idea
what he did to me
banging on door

lucas
daddy aidens very sick
frank grunting growling
grunts in pain
banging on door
screaming
lucas continues screaming
paul if you wouldnt mind
just telling me
what you make of these
warren hmm
breathes sharply
where did you find this
belongs to a student
is the student native
no
how can that be
julia i dont know he isnt
grunts
this is what was in the mine
this is what
was in the mine
its the wendigo
translates to
a diabolical wickedness
that devours mankind
according to legend during
a brutally cold winter
a lost hunters severe hunger
drove him to cannibalism
and after feasting on
human flesh
he became crazed
and transformed into
an amorphous spirit
that could take many forms
and roamed the forest
for fresh victims
his insatiable appetite
was never satisfied
paul chuckles
excuse me this is a myth
youre talking about
for you yeah
but a cautionary tale
to the indigenous people
who believe in it
theyre elusive
and known to
be eternally starving
but feasting only
makes them hungrier
and weaker
those who are unfortunate
enough to encounter one
can only kill it when its
in its weakened state
and only by extinguishing
its beating heart
forcing it to search
for another host
but it all makes sense
you see
i mean our ancestral spirits
never died
they were here
long before we were
and theyll be here
long after we are gone
but now theyre angry
man over radio paul
go for paul
man pumphouse road
