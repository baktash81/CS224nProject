still tomorrow will come
whos singing
what a strange song
melody be my guide
it makes me sick
why is everybody so happy
does everyone have
someone to love
shut up

crazy fashion
im hooked on her
who knows more about bell
an8bell
an8ive heard her sing
but shes nothing special
an8yeah
an8 irritating voice
too flashy
an8 selling her sex appeal
vulgar
no basic music skills
the arrangements are good not her
done by other people
take music seriously
still
i cant stop listening to this song
why
why
it feels like shes singing for me
like its for my ears only
no for mine
no shes singing just for me
why
why
how come
why
have you heard of bell

whos that
the girl in u right
shes so different
hello
hiro guess what happened bell
i know she made it
into the u global music hits
just as i expected
no shes being roasted like crazy
also expected
theyre just jealous of you
if you only get compliments
you only have hardcore fans
minor league
in u stardom is built on mixed opinions
half of them dont like me i want to die
but the other half likes you
be more confident
the secret to your success
i look like luka
and
the people who arrange my songs
what else
your production costumes dances and
no yes but no
the biggest secret is that its in u
its bodysharing technology draws out
the users hidden strengths
without it you wouldnt be singing
but crying all the time like usual
look at this
search for bells identity
what oh no
its funny how wrong they are
theyre naming all these celebrities
so far from the truth
its not funny
nobody would ever guess
that bell is a mousy
country bumpkin like you
youre scary
this is the best game ever
turning a nerdy freckled schoolgirl
into us superstar
this could mean big money
but dont worry
ill anonymously donate
every dollar to charities
fly through this untold nameless moment
reaching out for the crescent moon
bell is our new diva
isnt belle more suitable for her
belle
beautiful in french
a perfect name for a girl

who is that
the heck
the beast
dragons here
its the dragon
dragon
an ugly monster as that lives in u
wow
who is it
he suddenly appeared in the
martial arts arena a few months back
and has been setting records ever since
but he fights dirty
like how
go
he ruins the matches
he attacks until the data breaks down
like hes venting his anger
he loves showing off
the bruises on his back
hes covered in bruises
whos chasing him
the justices
justices
they claim to be the protectors
of justice and order in u
they do look like superheroes
oh no
how brutal
youve taken this too far
is everything about you
yeah
you ruined belles concert
take responsibility
apologize to belle
you wasted our time
get out of here
leave
hey
who are you

its that dragon guys fault
he should get unveiled already
why does he annoy people on purpose
he thinks hes cool
there must be a reason
hes just showing off
you think so
we should unveil him ourselves
kamishin whats with that huge bag
i have an away match you too
im not like you
the as is constantly in sync
with the users biometric info
so you cant have two avatars
i searched all over the internet
but theres no data
about his nationality age or gender
only that he suddenly appeared
seven months ago
theres no way to find him
not the user
but there are records
of his past opponents
i see
in 7 months he won 369 matches
lost 3 and tied in 2
most of his 374 opponents have other
sns accounts linked with u
we should talk to them
and see what they know
we will be using the study room
wow
a question to the dragons opponents
who is he
a mystery
definitely not ai
excessively aggressive
bad personality
why does he
take things so far
i was one of his first opponents
he didnt have as many bruises
theyre battle scars
the few of you who beat him
how did you win
he suddenly threw the match
he got distracted
angel
do you know something
any rumors at least
no
maybe its him
him
hes got bruises too
who
an8jellinek an obscure modern artist
he started getting tattoos
that looked like bruises

its written on your face
teenagers are attracted to bad boys
lonely and kind underneath
im the only one who understands him
i said no
why dont you give him a present
i studied abroad in ohio
during my senior year in high school
there was a guy with razorsharp eyes
who was always alone
a lone wolf
i was kind of interested in him
so i gave him a birthday present
what did you give him
a song
a song
a song
a celebration song
i wrote it and sang for him
thats so sweet
a love song
i saw him smile for the first time
he said he was happy
did you guys go out
no
why not
he was still in 8th grade
what
what
unbelievable
an 8th grader
i was touched when he cried
seeing me off at the airport
ive never written a love song
you want
to be left alone
or thats what youll say
trying to push me away
but the truth is
you dont want me to look
to see
whats in your heart
i guess ill record it
what
so many texts
they were holding hands
her and shinobu
why
theyre childhood friends
thats no excuse
she thinks shes better than us
whats going on
suzu
hiro

shinobu is something special
this proves how many girls
are watching him
i didnt do anything
its spreading like wildfire
theyre all lashing out its like theyre
venting their pentup feelings
so much tension scary
i thought they were all friends
i guess you never know
itll be an allout war if they continue
to show their true colors

how to extinguish the fires

sorry for the sudden text can we talk
the timings too perfect
why would she text you now
what do you mean
maybe shes behind this

thank you for saving me
belle
master
you want
to be left alone
or thats what youll say
trying to push me away
but the truth is
you dont want me to look
to see whats in your heart
anger fear sorrow
some nights it can be too much
yet you
keep it all to yourself
lend me your voice
the voice
you try so hard to hide
open the door
open up and let me see the heart
that hides inside
the secret rose
i can
make it on my own
or that is
what youll say
its something you told yourself
time and time again
those lonesome nights
but i want to see you
i want to see the real you
thats all thats been on my mind
lend me your voice
show me the face
that you try so hard to hide
open the door
open up and let me see
the heart that hides inside
call out the words
anything you want to say
ill be right here ill listen to the end
let me inside
let me come
and sit right next to your heart
whats happening
dont look at me
who are you
is belle not doing another concert
why wont she sing
she must be afraid
its the beasts fault
he should be unveiled
lets leave him alone
we dont have to know his secret
its not just us u isnt just
a small chat room for classmates
nobody can stop it
the beast threatens order in u
contact us with any info on the beast
at unveilthebeast
he must be an old fart
hes a young genius gamer
hes a she a sexy bombshell
i heard hes a billionaire
im suing him
for mental distress from our match
is jellinek back in the dating game
hes amazing
wait i never died
i guess not
i never said
it was my girlfriend who died
hes a copycat he got tattoos to imitate
the dragons bruises
shes lying
hes a con artist
shut up loser
what
plagiarism absolutely not
people think i have a secret
because i dont show my skin
the other day someone in u accused me
of being the dragon
but im not a villain nor a violent man
i want to be a true hero for the children
dont be shocked
i was very sick when i was little
and had several major surgeries
but i became healthy enough
to play baseball
all you kids watching this
dont give up on your dream
i hope this message
comes across the right way
so whos the dragon
unforgivable
downright unforgivable
i refuse to forgive anybody who hurts me
are you that ideal housewife
why a baby
because i have an innocent heart
i dont believe you
you think a cute baby
can get away with anything
shut up she hurt me
is it true belle will sing again
its just a rumor
i heard shes going to surprise us
its not true
but what if it is
where did belle go
belle
do you know why this light
is the power of justice
normally the biometric information
scanned by the device
is converted to the as
through a specialized process
this light completely invalidates
the conversion
the origin of the as
is projected here in u
this is how unveil works
it means i have the same power
only the voices
us creators have
have you ever wondered why
there are no police on the internet
why is there no law enforcement in u
when its so similar to the real world
its a good question
everybody wants to know why
but the voices insist
we already have everything we need
for a fair society
we disagree
every society has its villains
those who cause trouble and disrupt order
those who do as they please
and scoff at the world
we need the power to fight it
we need justice no matter where we are
we need the power to crush evil
and that power is us
the beast the ugly beast
he must be unveiled for the future of u
that said
why are you always with him
why
tell me where he is
or face the consequences
if you dont
ill unveil you right here and now
id never tell you
what
you dont care about justice
you just want to control other people
so im not telling you
i wont let you make a fool of me anymore
you think i cant unveil you
why dont we try
lets see the identity
of the worldfamous diva
the real face underneath
the beautiful mask
i can just imagine it youre probably
when the truth is revealed
who would pay any attention to your songs
if you dont want that
tell me who he is where is he
are you looking for something
ill tell you only you
what
dont tell anyone else
buzz off
damn it
thanks for saving me
im glad youre okay
hes in danger
i have to help him
i have to protect him
suzu

if youre in trouble
im not
you can tell me anything
theres nothing to tell
an8have a peach from mr matsuda

in front of the guy i like

i thought it was a marriage proposal
but he meant
hell protect me from bullies
he wasnt proposing of course
after my mom died
i was always crying
and it scared my classmates away
he must have thought i was being bullied
this might sound weird
but i always thought
he acted like your mom
my mom
he worries about you for nothing
and asks how youre doing all the time
shinobu isnt like other guys
i said his name

who is he underneath the surface
you hurt me
is he lonely like that woman
then
i got a tattoo
right where my lover was injured
his bruises arent like tattoos
i had several major surgeries
but they arent like real scars either
if the device scanned traces
of physical pain
his real body might also be bruised
but
why were his bruises trembling
and those childlike eyes
that he showed me
child
a kids voice
only he and i know this song
where is it coming from
suzu
