melody
be my guide
did i just sing 
i can finally sing again 
i want to picture a world
where a simple song
can make the difference
each day i wake  searching
i don t want to imagine
a future without you
i can t do that
but you re gone  the answer escapes me
seems like everyone else
has it figured out
still  tomorrow will come
who s singing 
what a strange song 
melody  be my guide 
it makes me sick
why is everybody so happy 
does everyone have
  someone to love 
  shut up 
what a weird song 
stop showing off 
she s not ugly but   
  look at those freckles 
  when i am alone
gross 
  quit it 
  i feel so uneasy
melody  be my guide 
whatever comes  i won t back down
you re amazing  you re beautiful 
thank you 
no followers 
the world is the same everywhere 
new follower
new comment
but   
i can finally sing again 
hiro started following you
hiro  you re awesome  i got you covered 
wow 
  i ve never heard that song before 
  she s good 
  oddly pretty 
  what s this song called 
  no hits in searches 
  crazy fashion 
  i m hooked on her 
  who knows more about bell 
  an8 bell 
  an8 i ve heard her sing
but she s nothing special 
  an8 yeah 
  an8   irritating voice 
  too flashy 
  an8   selling her sex appeal 
  vulgar 
no basic music skills 
  the arrangements are good  not her 
  done by other people 
take music seriously 
still   
i can t stop listening to this song 
why 
why 
it feels like she s singing for me 
like it s for my ears only 
no  for mine 
no  she s singing just for me 
  why 
  why 
  how come 
  why 
have you heard of bell 
of course 
  who s that 
  the girl in u  right 
she s so different 
hello 
hiro  guess what happened  bell   
i know  she made it
into the u global music hits 
just as i expected 
no  she s being roasted like crazy 
also expected 
they re just jealous of you 
if you only get compliments 
you only have hard core fans 
minor league 
in u  stardom is built on mixed opinions 
half of them don t like me  i want to die 
but the other half likes you 
be more confident 
the secret to your success 
i look like luka 
and 
the people who arrange my songs 
what else 
your production  costumes  dances  and   
no  yes but no 
the biggest secret is that it s in u 
its body sharing technology draws out
the user s hidden strengths 
without it  you wouldn t be singing
but crying all the time like usual 
look at this 
search for bell s identity   
what  oh  no 
it s funny how wrong they are 
they re naming all these celebrities 
so far from the truth 
it s not funny 
nobody would ever guess
that bell is a mousy
country bumpkin like you 
you re scary 
this is the best game ever 
turning a nerdy  freckled schoolgirl
into u s superstar 
this could mean big money 
but don t worry 
i ll anonymously donate
every dollar to charities 
fly through this untold  nameless moment
reaching out for the crescent moon
bell is our new diva 
isn t b e l l e more suitable for her 
  belle 
   beautiful  in french 
a perfect name for a girl
who s not quite perfect 
putting it mildly  belle is the best 
this has got to be a joke 
why is she more popular than me 
  an8   it s peggie sue 
  she s finished 
what  hey  get away from me 
you jealous nobody 
belle has changed the world 
more excitement  more spotlight 
belle is the best 
what s so funny  hiroka

okay 
who opened the dome 
get out of here 
he s being chased 
who is that 
  the heck 
  the beast 
  dragon s here 
  it s the dragon 
dragon 
an ugly monster as that lives in u 
  wow 
  who is it 
he suddenly appeared in the
martial arts arena a few months back 
and has been setting records ever since 
but he fights dirty 
like how 
go 
he ruins the matches 
he attacks until the data breaks down 
like he s venting his anger 
he loves showing off
the bruises on his back 
he s covered    in bruises 
who s chasing him 
  the justices 
  justices 
they claim to be the protectors
of justice and order in u 
they do look like superheroes 
oh  no 
how brutal 
you ve taken this too far 
is everything about you 
  yeah 
  you ruined belle s concert 
take responsibility 
  apologize to belle 
  you wasted our time 
  get out of here 
  leave 
hey   
who are you 
who   
don t look 
don t look at me 
beast 
unforgivable 
you will not get away with this 
we have to get rid of the beast
to maintain peace in u 
is he the leader 
yeah  that s justin 
look 
the light of truth that protects
justice and order in u 
we ll unveil the horrible beast 
look at all those sponsors 
  unveil 
  yes  unveil 
the doors 
you re finished  beast 
i m going to reveal your ugly  origin  
yeah  do it

jerk  you could ve hurt belle 
no    this is unacceptable 
i will unveil him one day 
who are you 
there  see you later 
suzu  dinner 
how about seafood 
okay 
 belle cancels concert  
i m so sorry 
that hurts 
it s that dragon guy s fault 
he should get unveiled already 
why does he annoy people on purpose 
he thinks he s cool 
there must be a reason 
he s just showing off 
you think so 
we should unveil him ourselves 
kamishin  what s with that huge bag 
i have an away match  you too 
i m not like you 
the as is constantly in sync
with the user s biometric info 
so you can t have two avatars 
i searched all over the internet
but there s no data
about his nationality  age  or gender 
only that he suddenly appeared
seven months ago 
there s no way to find him 
not the user 
but there are records
of his past opponents 
i see 
in 7 months  he won 369 matches 
lost 3  and tied in 2 
most of his 374 opponents have other
sns accounts linked with u 
we should talk to them
and see what they know 
we will be using the study room 
wow 
a question to the dragon s opponents 
who is he 
a mystery 
definitely not ai 
excessively aggressive 
bad personality 
  why does he   
  take things so far 
i was one of his first opponents 
he didn t have as many bruises 
they re battle scars 
the few of you who beat him 
how did you win 
he suddenly threw the match 
he got distracted 
angel   
do you know something 
any rumors at least 
  no 
  maybe it s him 
  him 
  he s got bruises too 
who 
  an8 jellinek  an obscure modern artist 
he started getting tattoos
that looked like bruises
around the time the dragon showed up 
the value of his artwork
has increased 20 times 
that s suspicious 
look  his agent s contact info 
let s call him 
are you serious  
i have nothing to say 
why the tattoos 
who are you 
what were you doing last night 
and with whom 
stop bugging me 
why won t you tell us 
leave me alone 
jellinek  exit
he s definitely hiding something 
  who else could it be 
  who knows 
i know someone like that 
someone annoying 
she always says   you hurt me  
yeah  maybe it s her 
a woman

suzu is in love 
with a bad boy 
no  why 
it s written on your face 
teenagers are attracted to bad boys 
lonely and kind underneath 
i m the only one who understands him 
i said no 
why don t you give him a present 
i studied abroad in ohio
during my senior year in high school 
there was a guy with razor sharp eyes
who was always alone 
a lone wolf 
i was kind of interested in him 
so i gave him a birthday present 
what did you give him 
a song 
  a song 
  a song 
a celebration song 
i wrote it and sang for him 
  that s so sweet 
  a love song 
i saw him smile for the first time 
he said he was happy 
  did you guys go out 
  no 
why not 
he was still in 8th grade 
  what 
  what 
  unbelievable 
  an 8th grader 
i was touched when he cried
seeing me off at the airport 
i ve never written a love song   
you want
to be left alone
or that s what you ll say
trying to push me away
but the truth is
you don t want me to look
to see
what s in your heart
i guess i ll record it 
what 
so many texts 
they were holding hands 
  her and shinobu 
  why 
  they re childhood friends 
  that s no excuse 
she thinks she s better than us 
what s going on 
  suzu 
  hiro 
did you seriously ask shinobu out 
  no 
  he asked you out 
of course not 
then why   
he held my hand   
you held hands 
no  he just grabbed my hand 
that s all  but it s blowing up 
shinobu is something special 
this proves how many girls
are watching him 
i didn t do anything 
it s spreading like wildfire 
they re all lashing out  it s like they re
venting their pent up feelings 
so much tension  scary 
i thought they were all friends 
i guess you never know 
it ll be an all out war if they continue
to show their true colors 
what should we do 
all right  i ll figure out
how to extinguish the fires 
you talk to the reasonable girls 
i ll try 
listen 
nothing happened 
he d never date me 
that s true 
  calm down 
  chill 
truce
hello 
we re out of the lion s den 
sorry   
it s a cruel world 
all hell broke loose because it was you 
no one would have reacted like this
if it were luka 
  it s from luka 
  what 
 sorry for the sudden text  can we talk  
the timing s too perfect 
why would she text you now 
what do you mean 
maybe she s behind this 
definitely not 
she must be after shinobu 
why would a pretty girl like her do this 
she kind of gets on my nerves 
she wanted my opinion
as his childhood friend 
i would ve ignored her  i m not that nice 
i can t shake it off   
he s practicing hard 
yeah  he is 
shinobu   
he s taking so damn long 
suzu  did something happen today 
you can tell me 
there s something
i wanted to ask you for a long time 
what is it 
you see   
well   
  well   
  suzu  heading home 
i just finished practicing  i m wiped out 
what s up 
kamishin  oh  right 
how was the away match 
i went and raced  but guess what happened 
a coach from my top college pick
was there to watch the match 
i was so pumped 
but i was totally off my game 
my results sucked  oh  by the way 
look 
i felt guilty about the guys
who didn t qualify for the nationals 
you qualified for the nationals 
  yeah 
  seriously 
that s awesome  i m rooting for you 
rooting for me 
  shinobu  if she s rooting for me   
  what 
does it mean   
suzu has a small crush on me 
what  no  huh 
go put that way  you idiot 
i was just kidding  suzu 
thanks for your support 
  get out of here 
  yeah 
so what were you about to say 
forget it 
  holding something back 
  no 
really 
really 
you don t have to waste your time
worrying about me anymore 
suzu 
i don t know what to do 
luka   
i m here for you  luka 
thanks  suzu 
i m so surprised  you ve given me courage 
a woman 
bruises 
don t touch me 
i m sorry  those bruises   
you think they re ugly 
no 
do those bruises hurt 
i m sure they do  i   
you don t know anything 
then explain it to me 
just get out 
  get out 
  get out 
stop 
what were you doing here 
did you see someone 
an ugly monster  perhaps 
are you belle 
why are you here 
you won t say 
then   
i ll ask your origin 
beast 
  it s him 
  after him 
  he s scared 
  what a wimp 
we ll crash 
where did he go  where 
beast 
stay away 
leave me alone 
i think i know you better now 
this is where it really hurts  right 
thank you for saving me 
belle   
master 
you want
to be left alone
or that s what you ll say
trying to push me away
but the truth is
you don t want me to look
to see what s in your heart
anger  fear  sorrow
some nights it can be too much
yet you
keep it all to yourself
lend me your voice
the voice
you try so hard to hide
open the door
open up and let me see the heart
that hides inside
the secret rose 
i can
make it on my own
or that is
what you ll say
it s something you told yourself
time and time again
those lonesome nights
but i want to see you
i want to see the real you
that s all that s been on my mind
lend me your voice
show me the face
that you try so hard to hide
open the door
open up and let me see
the heart that hides inside
call out the words
anything you want to say 
i ll be right here  i ll listen to the end
let me inside
let me come
and sit right next to your heart
what s happening 
don t look at me 
who are you 
 is belle not doing another concert 
why won t she sing  
 she must be afraid 
it s the beast s fault  
 he should be unveiled  
let s leave him alone 
we don t have to know his secret 
it s not just us  u isn t just
a small chat room for classmates 
nobody can stop it 
the beast threatens order in u 
contact us with any info on the beast
at  unveilthebeast 
he must be an old fart 
he s a young genius gamer 
he s a she  a sexy bombshell 
i heard he s a billionaire 
i m suing him
for mental distress from our match 
  is jellinek  back in the dating game 
  he s amazing 
wait  i never died 
i guess not 
i never said
it was my girlfriend who died 
he s a copycat  he got tattoos to imitate
the dragon s bruises 
she s lying 
he s a con artist 
shut up  loser 
what 
plagiarism  absolutely not 
people think i have a secret
because i don t show my skin 
the other day  someone in u accused me
of being the dragon 
but i m not a villain nor a violent man 
i want to be a true hero for the children 
don t be shocked 
i was very sick when i was little
and had several major surgeries 
but i became healthy enough
to play baseball 
all you kids watching this 
don t give up on your dream 
i hope this message
comes across the right way 
so who s the dragon 
unforgivable 
downright unforgivable 
i refuse to forgive anybody who hurts me 
are you that ideal housewife 
why a baby 
because i have an innocent heart 
i don t believe you 
you think a cute baby
can get away with anything 
shut up  she hurt me 
is it true belle will sing again 
it s just a rumor 
i heard she s going to surprise us 
it s not true 
but what if it is 
where did belle go 
belle 
do you know why this light
is the power of justice 
normally  the biometric information
scanned by the device
is converted to the as
through a specialized process 
this light completely invalidates
the conversion 
the origin of the as
is projected here in u 
this is how  unveil  works 
it means i have the same power
only the voices 
u s creators  have 
have you ever wondered why
there are no police on the internet 
why is there no law enforcement in u
when it s so similar to the real world 
it s a good question 
everybody wants to know why 
but the voices insist
we already have everything we need
for a fair society 
we disagree 
every society has its villains 
those who cause trouble and disrupt order 
those who do as they please
and scoff at the world 
we need the power to fight it 
we need justice no matter where we are 
we need the power to crush evil 
and that power is us 
the beast    the ugly beast 
he must be unveiled for the future of u 
that said   
why are you always with him 
why 
tell me where he is
or face the consequences 
if you don t   
i ll unveil you right here and now 
  i d never tell you 
  what 
you don t care about justice 
you just want to control other people 
so i m not telling you 
i won t let you make a fool of me anymore 
you think i can t unveil you 
why don t we try 
let s see the identity
of the world famous diva 
the real face underneath
the beautiful mask 
i can just imagine it  you re probably   
when the truth is revealed
who would pay any attention to your songs 
if you don t want that 
tell me who he is  where is he 
are you looking for something 
i ll tell you  only you 
what

but he meant
he ll protect me from bullies 
he wasn t proposing  of course 
after my mom died

this is bad 
but if we go now   
she ll find out that we know

please let belle go 
  an8 think again carefully 
who is he underneath the surface 
you hurt me 
is he lonely like that woman 
then   
i got a tattoo
right where my lover was injured 
his bruises aren t like tattoos   
i had several major surgeries 
but they aren t like real scars either 
if the device scanned traces
of physical pain 
his real body might also be bruised 
but   
why were his bruises trembling 
and those child like eyes
that he showed me   
child 
a kid s voice 
only he and i know this song 
where is it coming from 
suzu   
where  where are you 
  an8 i ve seen him somewhere   
  an8 the dragon is    my hero 
it s just me and my boys 
they don t have a mother
but they re happy 
  an8 we get along great   
  an8 why does he know this song 
i ll zoom in 
it s belle 
  an8 so  is he the dragon 
  an8 but something s off 
what do you mean 
i don t think it s him 
he doesn t seem to have any bruises 
  an8 tomo  what s that song 
  an8 i m working 
don t you realize how distracting it is 
why do you disobey me 
the world has rules
and i make the rules in this house 
if you can t follow them

you should disappear  go  disappear 
you re worthless so disappear 
if i can endure it   
i found him  this boy

  an8 let s cheer for dragon
a poor excuse for a father   
  an8 kei  are you okay  kei   
i see  i think i understand 
  an8 kei wanted to be a hero to encourage tomo 
i know why
  the dragon is so strong 
  hey 
since u s body sharing technology
reveals the hidden  you 
all this pain
must be the source of his strength 
like how suzu became belle   
accept

it s the only way to gain his trust 
suzu  what have you been doing
all of this for 
want to go back to the old you 
do you want to be a crybaby again
