it s located solidly on the meridian of misery 
my village 
in a word  sturdy  
it s been here for seven generations
but every single building is new  
 we have fishing  hunting 
and a charming view of the sunsets  
the only problems are the pests  
 you see  most places have mice or mosquitoes  
 we have    
    dragons 
 most people would leave 
but not us 
we re vikings  
we stubbornness issues 
my name is hiccup  
 great name  i know 
but it s not the worst  
 parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off gnomes and trolls  
like our charming
viking demeanor wouldn t do that  
  morning 
  what are you doing here 
  get inside 
get back inside 
hiccup  what is he doing out again    
what are you doing out  get inside 
that s stoick the vast  chief of the tribe  
 they say that when he was a baby he
popped a dragon s head clean off its shoulders  
do i believe it 
yes  i do 
what have we got 
gronckles  nadders  zipplebacks    
oh  and hordes of monstruous nightmares 
any night furys 
  none so far 
  good 
 light the torches 
oh  nice of you to join the party 
i thought you d been carried off 
who  me  nah  come on    
i m way too muscular for their taste 
they wouldn t know
what to do with all     this 
well  they need toothpicks  don t they 
the meathead with the attitude
and interchangeable hands  is gobber  
 i  have been his apprentice
ever since i was little  
 well  littler 
we move to the moor defenses 
we ll counterattack with the catapults 
see  old village 
lots and lots of new houses  
fire 
 oh  and that s fishlegs 
 snotlout 
the  twins  ruffnut and tuffnut    
 and    
astrid   
aww  their job is so much cooler 
oh  come on  let me out  please 
i need to make my mark 
oh  you have made plenty of marks 
all in the wrong places 
please  2 minutes  i ll kill a dragon 
my life will get infinitely better 
i might even get a date 
you can t lift a hammer 
you can t swing an axe 
you can t even throw one of these 
okay  fine 
but this will throw it for me 
see  now this right here
is what i m talking about 
but it     it s a mild calibration issue 
hiccup  if you ever want
to get out there to fight dragons
you need to stop all     
    this 
but you just pointed to all of me 
yes  that s it 
stop being all of you 
  oh    
  oh  yes 
you sir  are playing a dangerous game    
    keeping this much raw vikingness contained 
  there will be consequences 
  i take my chances 
sword  sharpened  now 
 one day i ll get out there  
 because killing a dragon
is everything around here  
a nadderhead is sure
to get me at least noticed 
 gronckles are tough 
 taking down one of those
would definitely get me a girlfriend  
a zippleback     
 exotic  two heads  twice the status  
they found the ship 
concentrate fire over the lower bank 
hurry up 
fire 
 and then  there s the monstruous nightmare  
only the best vikings go after those  
they have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire  
 reload 
i ll take care of this 
but the ultimate prize
is the dragon no one s ever seen 
we call it the    
  night fury 
  get down 
 jump 
this thing never steals food 
never shows itself  and    
     never misses  
 no one has ever killed a night fury  
 that s why i m going to be the first  
mind the fort  hiccup 
they need me out there 
stay     
put 
there 
you know what i mean 
  hiccup  what are you doing 
  come back here 
yeah  i know 
be right back 
mind yourself 
the devils still have some juice in them 
come on 
give me something to shoot at 
give me something to shoot at 
oh  i hit it 
yes  i hit it 
did anybody see that 
except for you 
  do not let them escape 
  right 
you re all out 
 oh  and there s one
more thing you need to know    
sorry  dad 
okay  but i hit a night fury 
it s not like the last few times  dad 
i mean  i really actually hit    
you guys were busy
and i had a very clear shot 
it went down just off raven point 
let s get a search party out there before    
stop 
just  stop 
every time you step outside
disaster falls 
can you not see
that i have bigger problems 
winter is almost here and i
have an entire village to feed 
between you and me  the village could
do with a little less feeding  don t you think 
this isn t a joke  hiccup 
why can t you follow the simplest orders 
i  i can t stop myself 
i see a dragon and i have to just    
    kill it 
you know  it s who i am  dad 
oh  you are many things  hiccup 
but a dragon killer is not one of them 
get back to the house 
make sure he gets there 
i have his mess to clean up 
quite the performance 
i ve never seen any one
mess up that badly  that helped 
thank you  thank you 
i was trying 
  i really did hit one 
  sure  hiccup 
  he never listens 
  well  it runs in the family 
and when he does  it s always
with this disappointed scowl
like someone skimped
on the meat in his sandwich 
excuse me  barmaid  i m afraid
you brought me the wrong offspring 
i ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms 
extra guts and glory on the side 
this here  this is a talking fish bone 
now  you re thinking about this all wrong 
it s not so much what you look like 
it s what s inside that he can t stand 
thank you for summing that up 
look  the point is  stop trying so hard
to be something you re not 
i just want to be one of you guys 
 either we face them or they ll finish us  
it s the only way we ll be rid of them 
if we find the nest and destroy it 
the dragons will leave 
they ll find another home 
one more search  before the ice sets in 
those ships never come back 
we re vikings 
it s an occupational hazard 
now who s with me 
alright     
those who stay will look after hiccup 
now  that s more like it 
i ll pack my undies 
no  i need you to stay 
and train some new recruits 
oh  perfect  yeah  and while i m busy
hiccup can cover the store 
molten steel  razor sharp blades 
lots of time to himself    
what could possibly go wrong 
oh  what am i going
to do with him  gobber 
put him in training with the others 
  no  i m serious 
  so am i 
he d be killed before you
let the first dragon out of its cage 
  oh  you don t know that 
  i do know that 
  no you don t
  no  actually  i do 
  no  you don t 
  listen  you know what he s like 
from the time he could crawl
he s been     different 
he doesn t listen  he has
the attention span of a sparrow 
i take him fishing and
he goes hunting for    for trolls 
trolls exist 
they steal your socks 
but only the left ones 
what s with that 
  when i was a boy    
  oh  here we go 
my father told me to bang my head
against a rock      and i did it 
i thought it was crazy 
but i didn t question him 
and you know what happened 
  you got a headache 
  that rock split in two 
it taught me what a viking could do  gobber 
he could crush mountains 
level forests     
    tame seas 
even as a boy i knew what i was 
what i had to become    
hiccup is not that boy 
you can t stop him  stoick 
you can only prepare him 
i know it seems hopeless  but the truth is
you won t always be around to protect him 
he s going to get out there again 
he s probably out there now 
oh  the gods hate me 
some people lose their knife or their mug 
no  not me 
i managed to lose an entire dragon 
ow 
oh  wow  i   i did it 
oh  i did it 
this fixes everything  yes 
i have brought down this mighty beast 
i m gonna kill you  dragon 
i m gonna     i m gonna cut out
your heart and take it to my father 
i m a viking 
i m a viking 
i did this 
hiccup 
dad  uh    
  i have to talk to you  dad 
  i need to speak with you too  son 
  i think it s time you to learned to fight dragons 
  i don t want to fight dragons 
  what 
  what 
  uh  you go first 
  no  no  you go first 
all right  you got your wish 
dragon training  you start in the morning 
oh man  i should have gone first 
uh  cause i was thinking  you know 
we have a surplus of dragon fighting vikings but     
do we have enough bread making vikings 
or small home repair vikings    
  you ll need this 
  i don t want to fight dragons 
  oh come on  yes you do 
  rephrase  dad  i can t kill dragons 
but you will kill dragons 
no  i m really very extra sure that i won t 
  it s time  hiccup 
  can you not hear me 
this is serious  son 
when you carry this axe 
you carry all of us with you 
which means  you walk like us 
you talk like us  you think like us 
  no more of     this 
  you just gestured to all of me 
  deal 
  this conversation is feeling very one sided 
deal 
deal 
good 
train hard 
i ll be back  probably 
and i ll be here  maybe 
welcome to dragon training 
no turning back 
i hope i get some serious burns 
i m hoping for some mauling 
like on my shoulder or lower back 
yeah  it s only fun if you get a scar out of it 
yeah  no kidding  right  pain  love it 
oh  great  who let him in 
lets get started 
the recruit who does best 
will win the honor of killing his first
dragon in front of the entire village 
hiccup already killed a night fury 
so does that disqualify him or     
can i transfer to the class
with the cool vikings 
don t worry  you re small and you re weak 
that will make you a less of a target 
they ll see you as sick or insane
and go after the more viking like teens instead 
behind these doors are just a few of the
many species you will learn to fight 
  the deadly nadder 
  speed  8  armor  16 
  the hideous zippleback 
  11 stealth times two 
  the monstrous nightmare 
  fire power  15 
  the terrible terror 
  attack  8  venom  12 
can you stop that 
  and the gronckle 
  jaw strength  8 
woah  woah  wait  aren t you going to teach us first 
i believe in learning on the job 
 today is about survival 
if you get blasted  you re dead  
quick  what s the first thing
you re going to need 
  a doctor 
    5 speed 
  a shield 
  shield  go 
your most important piece
of equipment is your shield 
if you must make a choice
between a sword or a shield 
take the shield 
  get your hands off my shield 
  there s like a million shields 
take that one 
it has a flower on it  girls like flowers 
oops  now this one has blood on it 
tuffnut  ruffnut  your out 
  what 
  what 
those shields are good for another
thing  noise 
make lots of it and throw off a dragon s aim 
all dragons have a limited number of shots 
how many does a gronckle have 
  five 
  no  six 
right  six  thats one for each of you 
fishlegs  out 
hiccup  get in there 
so anyway  i moved into my parent s basement 
you should come by sometimes to work out 
you look like you work out 
snotlout  your done 
  so i guess its just you and me 
  nope  just you 
one shot left 
hiccup 
and that s 6 
go back to bed you overgrown sausage 
you ll get another chance 
don t you worry 
remember  a dragon will always    
    always go for the kill 
so why didn t you 
well this was stupid 
why don t you just fly away 
alright  where did astrid
go wrong in the ring today 
i mistimed my sommersault dive 
it was sloppy  it threw off my reverse tumble 
  yeah  we noticed 
  no  no you were great  that was so astrid 
she s right  you have to be tough on yourselves 
where did hiccup go wrong 
  uh  he showed up 
  he didn t get eaten 
he s never where he should be 
thank you  astrid 
you need to live and breathe this stuff 
the dragon manual    
everything we know about every dragon we know of 
no attacks tonight 
hurry up 
  wait  you mean read 
  while we re still alive 
why read words when you can just
kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about 
oh  i ve read it like 7 times 
there s this water dragon
that sprays boiling water at your face
and there s this other one
that buries itself for like a week    
yeah  sounds great 
there was a chance i was going to read that 
but now    
you guys read  i ll go kill something 
hey 
  so i guess we ll share 
  read it 
all mine then  wow  so  okay 
i ll see you uh      tomorrow 
dragon classifications
strike class  fear class  mystery class 
thunder drum  this reclusive dragon
inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools 
when startled  the thunder drum produces a
concussive sound that can kill a man at close range 
extremely dangerous  kill on sight 
timberjack  this gigantic creature has razor sharp
wings that can slice through full grown trees 
extremely dangerous  kill on sight 
skulldren  sprays scalding water on its victim 
extremely dangerous    
changeling  even newly hatch dragons can spray acid 
kill on sight 
gronckle  zippleback  the skrill 
boneknapper  whispering death 
burns its victims 
buries its victims  chokes its victims 
turns victims inside out 
extremely dangerous     
extremely dangerous     
kill on sight      kill on sight     
kill on sight     
night fury  speed unknown 
size unknown 
the unholy offspring of
lightning and death itself 
never engage this dragon 
your only chance 
hide and pray it does not find you 
i can almost smell them   they re close 
steady 
  take us in 
  hard to port 
the hell hounds gate 
 hard to port 
hey  you know  i just happened to notice 
the book had nothing on night furys 
is there like another book  or a sequel 
maybe a little night fury pamphlet 
focus  hiccup 
you re not even trying  
 today is all about attack 
nadder s are quick and light on their feet 
you be quicker and lighter  
i m really beginning
to question your teaching methods 
look for its blind spot 
every dragon has one 
find it  hide in it  and strike 
  do you ever bathe 
  you don t like it  then just get your own blind spot 
how about i give you one 
blind spot  yes 
death spot  not so much 
hey  hey  so how would one
sneak up on a night fury 
no one s ever met one  and lived
to tell the tale  now  get in there 
i know  i know but hypothetically    
watch out  babe  i ll take care of this 
the sun was in my eyes  astrid 
what do you want me to do 
block out the sun 
i can do that 
i don t have time right now 
  has anyone ever seen one napping 
  hiccup 
hiccup 
  love on the battlefield 
  she could do better 
l let me     why don t you   
ow  ow  ow 
well done  astrid 
is this some kind of a joke to you 
our parent s war is about to become ours 
figure out which side your on 
huh  toothless 
i could of sworn you have    
    teeth 
uh  uh      no  no      no    
i     i don t have anymore 
and with one twist 
he took my hand and swallowed it whole 
and i saw the look in his face 
i was delicious 
he must have passed the word 
because it wasn t a month
before another one of them took my leg 
isn t it weird to think that your
hand was inside a dragon 
like  if your mind was still in control of it 
you could have killed the dragon from the inside
by crushing his heart or something 
i swear  i m so angry right now 
i ll avenge your beautiful hand
and your beautiful foot 
i ll chop of the legs of every dragon
i fight     with my face 
no  its the wings
and the tails you really want 
if it can t fly  it can t get away 
a downed dragon is a dead dragon 
   yeah 
  yeah 
alright  i m off to bed 
you should be too 
tomorrow we get to the big boys 
slowly but surely  making our way
up to monstruous nightmare 
  but who ll win the honor of killing it 
  it s gonna be me  it s my destiny  see 
   your mom let you get a tattoo 
  it s not a tattoo  it s a birth mark  
 okay  i ve been stuck with you since birth
and that was never there before  
 yes  it was  you ve just never
seen me to the left side until now  
hey  toothless 
i brought breakfast 
i hope     i hope you re hungry 
okay  that s disgusting 
i got some salmon  some nice
icelandic cod  and a whole smoked eel 
no  no  no  no      no      okay 
yeah  i don t really like eel much either 
that s it  that s the good stuff 
aah  don t you mind me 
i ll just be back here  minding my own business 
its okay    
okay  okay    
okay  that s not too bad 
it works 
no  no  no  no  no  no      
oh my     its working 
yes  yes  i did it 
 today  is about teamwork  
now  a wet dragon head can t light its fire 
the hideous zippleback is extra tricky 
one head breathes gas 
the other head lights it 
your job is to know which is which 
razor sharp serrated teeth 
and injects venom for predigestion 
prefers ambush attack  crushing its victims 
will you please stop that  
if that dragon shows either
of his faces  i m gonna    
there 
hey  its us  idiots 
your butts are getting bigger
we thought you were a dragon 
not that theres anything wrong
with a dragon ass fig

well being     uh     hiccup 
to placing first in dragon training 
well  i would have tied him to a mast
and shipped him off  for fear he d gone mad 
and you know it 
but  here we are 
and no ones more surprised
or more proud than i am 
today my boy becomes a viking 
today he becomes one of us 
be careful with that dragon 
it s not the dragon i m worried about 
what are you going to do 
put an end to this 
i have to try 
astrid  if something goes wrong 
just make sure they don t find toothless 
i will  just promise me
it won t go wrong 
it s time  hiccup 
knock  em dead 
i d have gone for the hammer 
i m ready 
go on hiccup  give it to him 
what is he doing 
its okay  its okay 
i m not one of them 
what s he thinking 
stop the fight 
no  i need you all to see this 
they re not what we think they are 
we don t have to kill them 
i said stop the fight 
out of my way 
hiccup 
hiccup 
this way 
night fury 
alright  toothless  go 
get out of here 
go  go 
no  dad 
dad  he won t hurt you 
toothless  stop 
no  no 
get him 
no  no  please 
just don t hurt him
please  don t hurt him
put it with the others 
i should have known 
i should have seen the signs 
  dad 
  we had a deal 
i know  we did  but that was before i    
oh  it s all so messed up 
so everything in that ring    
a trick  a lie 
i screwed up 
i should have told you before now 
take this out on me  be mad at me 
but please  just don t hurt toothless 
the dragon 
that s what you re worried about 
not the people you almost killed 
he was just protecting me 
he s not dangerous 
they ve killed hundreds of us 
and we ve killed thousands of them 
they defend themselves  that s all 
they raid us because they have to 
if they don t bring enough food back 
they ll be eaten themselves 
there s something else on their island  dad 
it s a dragon like    
their island 
so  you ve been to the nest 
  did i say nest 
  how did you find it 
no  no  i didn t  toothless did 
only a dragon can find the island 
no  no  dad  no please 
its not what you think 
you don t know what your up against 
it s like nothing you ve ever seen 
dad  please  i promise you 
you can t win this one 
dad  no 
for once in your life 
would you please just listen to me 
you ve thrown your lot in with them 
you re not a viking 
you re not my son 
ready the ships 
set sail 
we head for hell hinds gate 
lead us home  devil 
it s a mess 
you must feel horrible 
you ve lost everything 
your father  your tribe  your best friend 
thank you for summing that up 
why couldn t i ve killed that dragon 
when i found him the woods 
would ve been better for everyone 
yep  the rest of us would have done it 
so  why didn t you 
why didn t you 
i don t know  i couldn t 
  that s not an answer 
  why is this so important to you all of a sudden 
because i want to remember
what you say  right now 
ah  for the love of    
i was coward  i was weak 
i wouldn t kill a dragon 
you said wouldn t that time 
whatever  i wouldn t 
300 years and i m the first viking
who wouldn t kill a dragon 
first to ride one though 
so 
i wouldn t kill him because
he looked as frightened as i was 
i looked at him and i saw myself 
i bet he s really frightened now 
what are you gonna do about it 
probably something stupid 
good  but you ve already done that 
then something crazy 
that s more like it 
sound your positions 
stay within earshot 
listen  stoick  i was overhearing some
of the men just now and well  you know     
    some of them are wondering
what it is we re up to here 
not me of course  i know you
are always the man with the plan 
but some  not me  are wondering
if there is in fact a plan at all    
    and what it might be 
find the nest and take it 
of course  send them running 
the old viking fallback  nice and simple 
step aside 
head to port 
if you re planning on getting eaten 
i d definitely go with the gronckle 
you were wise to seek help from the
world s most deadly weapon 
it s me 
  i love this plan 
  i didn t    
you re crazy  i like that 
so  what is the plan 
 that s not very encouraging 
oh  i was wondering where that went 
stay low  and ready your weapons 
we re here 
wait  what are you      
it s okay      it s okay 
where are you going 
you re gonna need
something to help you hold on 
when we crack this mountain open 
all hell is gonna break loose 
    in my undies 
good thing i brought extras 
no matter how this ends 
it ends today 
is that it 
we ve done it 
this isn t over 
form your ranks 
pull together 
get clear 
beards of thor       
what is that 
odin  help us 
  catapults 
  fire 
  get to the ships 
  no  nooo 
  not that one    
  i was a fool 
lead the men to
the far side of the island 
gobber  go with the men 
i think i ll stay  just in case
you re thinking of doing something crazy 
i can buy them a few minutes
if i give that thing something to hunt for 
then i can double that time

i could get used to it 
welcome home 
   night fury 
  get down 
you ready 
this is berk     
it snows  nine months of the year
and hails the other three  
 any food that grows here
is tough and tasteless  
 the people that grow here
are even more so  
 the only upsides
are the pets
