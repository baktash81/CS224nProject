its located solidly on the meridian of misery
my village
in a word sturdy
its been here for seven generations
but every single building is new
we have fishing hunting
and a charming view of the sunsets
the only problems are the pests
you see most places have mice or mosquitoes
we have
dragons
most people would leave
but not us
were vikings
we stubbornness issues
my name is hiccup
great name i know
but its not the worst
parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off gnomes and trolls
like our charming
viking demeanor wouldnt do that
morning
what are you doing here
get inside
get back inside
hiccup what is he doing out again
what are you doing out get inside
thats stoick the vast chief of the tribe
they say that when he was a baby he
popped a dragons head clean off its shoulders
do i believe it
yes i do
what have we got
gronckles nadders zipplebacks
oh and hordes of monstruous nightmares
any night furys
none so far
good
light the torches
oh nice of you to join the party
i thought youd been carried off
who me nah come on
im way too muscular for their taste
they wouldnt know
what to do with all  this
well they need toothpicks dont they
the meathead with the attitude
and interchangeable hands is gobber
i  have been his apprentice
ever since i was little
well littler
we move to the moor defenses
well counterattack with the catapults
see old village
lots and lots of new houses
fire
oh and thats fishlegs
snotlout
the  twins ruffnut and tuffnut
and
astrid
aww their job is so much cooler
oh come on let me out please
i need to make my mark
oh you have made plenty of marks
all in the wrong places
please 2 minutes ill kill a dragon
my life will get infinitely better
i might even get a date
you cant lift a hammer
you cant swing an axe
you cant even throw one of these
okay fine
but this will throw it for me
see now this right here
is what im talking about
but it  its a mild calibration issue
hiccup if you ever want
to get out there to fight dragons
you need to stop all
this
but you just pointed to all of me
yes thats it
stop being all of you
oh
oh yes
you sir are playing a dangerous game
keeping this much raw vikingness contained
there will be consequences
i take my chances
sword sharpened now
one day ill get out there
because killing a dragon
is everything around here
a nadderhead is sure
to get me at least noticed
gronckles are tough
taking down one of those
would definitely get me a girlfriend
a zippleback
exotic two heads twice the status
they found the ship
concentrate fire over the lower bank
hurry up
fire
and then theres the monstruous nightmare
only the best vikings go after those
they have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire
reload
ill take care of this
but the ultimate prize
is the dragon no ones ever seen
we call it the
night fury
get down
jump
this thing never steals food
never shows itself and
never misses
no one has ever killed a night fury
thats why im going to be the first
mind the fort hiccup
they need me out there
stay
put
there
you know what i mean
hiccup what are you doing
come back here
yeah i know
be right back
mind yourself
the devils still have some juice in them
come on
give me something to shoot at
give me something to shoot at
oh i hit it
yes i hit it
did anybody see that
except for you
do not let them escape
right
youre all out
oh and theres one
more thing you need to know
sorry dad
okay but i hit a night fury
its not like the last few times dad
i mean i really actually hit
you guys were busy
and i had a very clear shot
it went down just off raven point
lets get a search party out there before
stop
just stop
every time you step outside
disaster falls
can you not see
that i have bigger problems
winter is almost here and i
have an entire village to feed
between you and me the village could
do with a little less feeding dont you think
this isnt a joke hiccup
why cant you follow the simplest orders
i i cant stop myself
i see a dragon and i have to just
kill it
you know its who i am dad
oh you are many things hiccup
but a dragon killer is not one of them
get back to the house
make sure he gets there
i have his mess to clean up
quite the performance
ive never seen any one
mess up that badly that helped
thank you thank you
i was trying
i really did hit one
sure hiccup
he never listens
well it runs in the family
and when he does its always
with this disappointed scowl
like someone skimped
on the meat in his sandwich
excuse me barmaid im afraid
you brought me the wrong offspring
i ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms
extra guts and glory on the side
this here this is a talking fish bone
now youre thinking about this all wrong
its not so much what you look like
its whats inside that he cant stand
thank you for summing that up
look the point is stop trying so hard
to be something youre not
i just want to be one of you guys
either we face them or theyll finish us
its the only way well be rid of them
if we find the nest and destroy it
the dragons will leave
theyll find another home
one more search before the ice sets in
those ships never come back
were vikings
its an occupational hazard
now whos with me
alright
those who stay will look after hiccup
now thats more like it
ill pack my undies
no i need you to stay
and train some new recruits
oh perfect yeah and while im busy
hiccup can cover the store
molten steel razor sharp blades
lots of time to himself
what could possibly go wrong
oh what am i going
to do with him gobber
put him in training with the others
no im serious
so am i
hed be killed before you
let the first dragon out of its cage
oh you dont know that
i do know that
no you dont
no actually i do
no you dont
listen you know what hes like
from the time he could crawl
hes been  different
he doesnt listen he has
the attention span of a sparrow
i take him fishing and
he goes hunting for  for trolls
trolls exist
they steal your socks
but only the left ones
whats with that
when i was a boy
oh here we go
my father told me to bang my head
against a rock  and i did it
i thought it was crazy
but i didnt question him
and you know what happened
you got a headache
that rock split in two
it taught me what a viking could do gobber
he could crush mountains
level forests
tame seas
even as a boy i knew what i was
what i had to become
hiccup is not that boy
you cant stop him stoick
you can only prepare him
i know it seems hopeless but the truth is
you wont always be around to protect him
hes going to get out there again
hes probably out there now
oh the gods hate me
some people lose their knife or their mug
no not me
i managed to lose an entire dragon
ow
oh wow i i did it
oh i did it
this fixes everything yes
i have brought down this mighty beast
im gonna kill you dragon
im gonna  im gonna cut out
your heart and take it to my father
im a viking
im a viking
i did this
hiccup
dad uh
i have to talk to you dad
i need to speak with you too son
i think its time you to learned to fight dragons
i dont want to fight dragons
what
what
uh you go first
no no you go first
all right you got your wish
dragon training you start in the morning
oh man i should have gone first
uh cause i was thinking you know
we have a surplus of dragon fighting vikings but
do we have enough breadmaking vikings
or small home repair vikings
youll need this
i dont want to fight dragons
oh come on yes you do
rephrase dad i cant kill dragons
but you will kill dragons
no im really very extra sure that i wont
its time hiccup
can you not hear me
this is serious son
when you carry this axe
you carry all of us with you
which means you walk like us
you talk like us you think like us
no more of  this
you just gestured to all of me
deal
this conversation is feeling very onesided
deal
deal
good
train hard
ill be back probably
and ill be here maybe
welcome to dragon training
no turning back
i hope i get some serious burns
im hoping for some mauling
like on my shoulder or lower back
yeah its only fun if you get a scar out of it
yeah no kidding right pain love it
oh great who let him in
lets get started
the recruit who does best
will win the honor of killing his first
dragon in front of the entire village
hiccup already killed a night fury
so does that disqualify him or
can i transfer to the class
with the cool vikings
dont worry youre small and youre weak
that will make you a less of a target
theyll see you as sick or insane
and go after the more vikinglike teens instead
behind these doors are just a few of the
many species you will learn to fight
the deadly nadder
speed 8 armor 16
the hideous zippleback
11 stealth times two
the monstrous nightmare
fire power 15
the terrible terror
attack 8 venom 12
can you stop that
and the gronckle
jaw strength 8
woah woah wait arent you going to teach us first
i believe in learning on the job
today is about survival
if you get blasted youre dead
quick whats the first thing
youre going to need
a doctor
5 speed
a shield
shield go
your most important piece
of equipment is your shield
if you must make a choice
between a sword or a shield
take the shield
get your hands off my shield
theres like a million shields
take that one
it has a flower on it girls like flowers
oops now this one has blood on it
tuffnut ruffnut your out
what
what
those shields are good for another
thing noise
make lots of it and throw off a dragons aim
all dragons have a limited number of shots
how many does a gronckle have
five
no six
right six thats one for each of you
fishlegs out
hiccup get in there
so anyway i moved into my parents basement
you should come by sometimes to work out
you look like you work out
snotlout your done
so i guess its just you and me
nope just you
one shot left
hiccup
and thats 6
go back to bed you overgrown sausage
youll get another chance
dont you worry
remember a dragon will always
always go for the kill
so why didnt you
well this was stupid
why dont you just fly away
alright where did astrid
go wrong in the ring today
i mistimed my sommersault dive
it was sloppy it threw off my reverse tumble
yeah we noticed
no no you were great that was so astrid
shes right you have to be tough on yourselves
where did hiccup go wrong
uh he showed up
he didnt get eaten
hes never where he should be
thank you astrid
you need to live and breathe this stuff
the dragon manual
everything we know about every dragon we know of
no attacks tonight
hurry up
wait you mean read
while were still alive
why read words when you can just
kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about
oh ive read it like 7 times
theres this water dragon
that sprays boiling water at your face
and theres this other one
that buries itself for like a week
yeah sounds great
there was a chance i was going to read that
but now
you guys read ill go kill something
hey
so i guess well share
read it
all mine then wow so okay
ill see you uh  tomorrow
dragon classifications
strike class fear class mystery class

wings that can slice through fullgrown trees
extremely dangerous kill on sight
skulldren sprays scalding water on its victim

night fury speed unknown
size unknown
the unholy offspring of
lightning and death itself
never engage this dragon
your only chance
hide and pray it does not find you
i can almost smell them  theyre close
steady
take us in
hard to port
the hell hounds gate
hard to port
hey you know i just happened to notice
the book had nothing on night furys
is there like another book or a sequel
maybe a little night fury pamphlet
focus  hiccup
youre not even trying
today is all about attack
nadders are quick and light on their feet
you be quicker and lighter
im really beginning
to question your teaching methods
look for its blind spot
every dragon has one
find it hide in it and strike
do you ever bathe
you dont like it then just get your own blind spot
how about i give you one
blind spot yes
death spot notsomuch
hey hey so how would one
sneak up on a night fury
no ones ever met one and lived
to tell the tale now get in there
i know i know but hypothetically
watch out babe ill take care of this
the sun was in my eyes astrid
what do you want me to do
block out the sun
i can do that
i dont have time right now
has anyone ever seen one napping
hiccup
hiccup
love on the battlefield
she could do better
llet me  why dont you
ow ow ow
well done astrid
is this some kind of a joke to you
our parents war is about to become ours
figure out which side your on
huh toothless
i could of sworn you have
teeth
uh uh  no no  no
i  i dont have anymore
and with one twist
he took my hand and swallowed it whole
and i saw the look in his face
i was delicious
he must have passed the word
because it wasnt a month
before another one of them took my leg
isnt it weird to think that your
hand was inside a dragon
like if your mind was still in control of it
you could have killed the dragon from the inside
by crushing his heart or something
i swear im so angry right now
ill avenge your beautiful hand
and your beautiful foot
ill chop of the legs of every dragon
i fight  with my face
no its the wings
and the tails you really want
if it cant fly it cant get away
a downed dragon is a dead dragon
yeah
yeah
alright im off to bed
you should be too
tomorrow we get to the big boys
slowly but surely making our way
up to monstruous nightmare
but wholl win the honor of killing it
its gonna be me its my destiny see
your mom let you get a tattoo
its not a tattoo its a birth mark
okay ive been stuck with you since birth
and that was never there before

aah dont you mind me
ill just be back here minding my own business
its okay
okay okay
okay thats not too bad
it works
no no no no no no
oh my  its working
yes yes i did it
today is about teamwork
now a wet dragon head cant light its fire
the hideous zippleback is extra tricky
one head breathes gas
the other head lights it
your job is to know which is which
razorsharp serrated teeth
and injects venom for predigestion
prefers ambush attack crushing its victims
will you please stop that
if that dragon shows either
of his faces im gonna
there
hey its us idiots
your butts are getting bigger
we thought you were a dragon
not that theres anything wrong
with a dragonass fig

everything else
what are you looking at
well i can show my face in public again
if someone had told me that
in a few short weeks
hiccup will go from
well being  uh  hiccup
to placing first in dragon training
well i would have tied him to a mast
and shipped him off for fear hed gone mad
and you know it
but here we are
and no ones more surprised
or more proud than i am
today my boy becomes a viking
today he becomes one of us
be careful with that dragon
its not the dragon im worried about
what are you going to do
put an end to this
i have to try
astrid if something goes wrong
just make sure they dont find toothless
i will just promise me
it wont go wrong
its time hiccup
knock em dead
id have gone for the hammer
im ready
go on hiccup give it to him
what is he doing
its okay its okay
im not one of them

we dont have to kill them
i said stop the fight
out of my way
hiccup
hiccup

night fury
alright toothless go
get out of here

no dad
dad he wont hurt you
toothless stop
no no

please dont hurt him
put it with the others
i should have known
i should have seen the signs
dad
we had a deal
i know we did but that was before i
oh its all so messed up
so everything in that ring
a trick a lie
i screwed up
i should have told you before now
take this out on me be mad at me
but please just dont hurt toothless
the dragon
thats what youre worried about
not the people you almost killed
he was just protecting me
hes not dangerous
theyve killed hundreds of us
and weve killed thousands of them
they defend themselves thats all
they raid us because they have to
if they dont bring enough food back
theyll be eaten themselves
theres something else on their island dad
its a dragonlike
their island
so youve been to the nest
did i say nest
how did you find it
no no i didnt toothless did
only a dragon can find the island
no no dad no please
its not what you think
you dont know what your up against
its like nothing youve ever seen
dad please i promise you
you cant win this one
dad no
for once in your life
would you please just listen to me
youve thrown your lot in with them
youre not a viking
youre not my son
ready the ships
set sail
we head for hellhinds gate
lead us home devil
its a mess
you must feel horrible
youve lost everything
your father your tribe your best friend
thank you for summing that up
why couldnt ive killed that dragon
when i found him the woods
wouldve been better for everyone
yep the rest of us would have done it
so why didnt you
why didnt you
i dont know i couldnt
thats not an answer
why is this so important to you all of a sudden
because i want to remember
what you say right now
ah for the love of
i was coward i was weak
i wouldnt kill a dragon
you said wouldnt that time
whatever i wouldnt
300 years and im the first viking
who wouldnt kill a dragon
first to ride one though
so
i wouldnt kill him because
he looked as frightened as i was
i looked at him and i saw myself
i bet hes really frightened now
what are you gonna do about it
probably something stupid
good but youve already done that
then something crazy
thats more like it
sound your positions
stay within earshot
listen stoick i was overhearing some
of the men just now and well you know
some of them are wondering
what it is were up to here
not me of course i know you
are always the man with the plan
but some not me are wondering
if there is in fact a plan at all
and what it might be
find the nest and take it
of course send them running
the old viking fallback nice and simple
step aside
head to port
if youre planning on getting eaten
id definitely go with the gronckle
you were wise to seek help from the
worlds most deadly weapon
its me
i love this plan
i didnt
youre crazy i like that
so what is the plan
thats not very encouraging
oh i was wondering where that went
stay low and ready your weapons
were here
wait what are you
its okay  its okay
where are you going
youre gonna need
something to help you hold on
when we crack this mountain open
all hell is gonna break loose
in my undies
