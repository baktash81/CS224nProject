when mom went out to buy this thing 
i specifically told her not to get a book
that said  diary  on it 
but  of course  she didn t listen 
 video game beeping 
it s been hard enough getting through
the first week of middle school
without carrying this thing
around with me 
hey  this kid s got a diary 
 laughs 
a actually  it s a jour  
 grunts 
 both laughing 
 boy  if mom s expecting me to write down
my feelings or whatever 
she s gonna be disappointed 
 chattering 
the only reason i agreed
to write in this thing at all
is because one day
i m gonna be rich and famous 
and people ll wanna read about my
early years  so i m doing this for them 
 greg is so smart 
 so handsome 
 so brave 
 and he smells terrific 
 greg 
but for now  i m stuck in middle school 
 both grunt 
 greg   surrounded by morons 
 grunts 
 greg  but luckily  i m not alone
in this middle school thing 
my best friend  rowley 
is in the same grade as me 
i doubt he s ever gonna be
rich and famous 
but it s good to have him around
for laughs 
did you know
if your hand is bigger than your face 
it s a sign that your brain is shrinking 
it is 
 laughs  gotcha 
but does this mean my brain is shrinking 
not sure 
let s check the other hand 
 greg 
i m glad rowley s along for the ride 
because everything else
about middle school stinks 
and i can t believe it was just a week ago
that me and rowley were actually
looking forward to this 
heads up 
 snaps 
 bell dings 
that was a good one 
you almost hit the front tire that time 
you just need to slow down a little
so i can get locked in 
 rowley panting 
 let me get this straight 
 come on  rowley 
so in middle school 
do you just go to a different room
for each class 
come on  you got it 
and you just carry all your stuff
around with you all day 
no  no  no  no  no 
they give you a locker
so you can just ditch the books you
don t need in between periods 
w w what about recess 
 continues panting 
there s still recess  right 
i told you  like  a million times  rowley 
recess is an elementary school thing 
aw  but i like recess 
are you gonna go 
or are you just gonna sit there 
don t you want a turn riding 
i ve gone three times in a row 
 dog barks 
but you re way better at riding than me 
i can never do it as good as you 
woo hoo 
 screaming  laughing 
  grunts 
  rowley screaming  laughing 
 horn honks 
 laughs 
 screams 
 screams  grunts 
oh  come on  rodrick  you made me miss 
 rowley  i m okay 
 sighs 
 greg  one of the reasons
i m friends with rowley is
there aren t a whole lot of boys my age
in the neighborhood 
in fact  aside from rowley 
there s only really    screams 
fregley 
why  hello  greg heffley 
 groans  hi  fregley  i was just  um 
getting   getting my football 
wanna come inside my house for a playdate 
i can show you my room 
you know  i ll definitely take you up
on that offer sometime 
 screams 
wanna see my 
secret freckle 
 chuckling 
 sighs  screams 
  rowley laughs 
  greg screams 
 screams  grunts 
 rowley shouting 
should we do that one over 
 grunts 
 woman  who s hungry 
 woman humming 
 baby grunts  giggles 
so  did everyone have a good day 
frank  don t do that with your food 
it s weird 
 it tastes better this way 
  baby grunts 
hey  oh 
i m still gonna eat it 
greg  is that dirt
on your back to school clothes 
 sighs  please don t call them that 
what on earth were you doing
to get so filthy 
i was throwing a football in the street
with rowley 
you were playing a sport with
your feet and hands and not a device 
 chuckles  wo   wow 
i guess 
mark the calendar  susan 
greg here played a sport 
you weren t playing that game
with rowley  were you 
you know you re banned from playing that 
somebody is going to get hurt 
what 
oh  oh  that game 
no  no way 
you said we couldn t play that anymore 
right  and rowley s parents
are in full agreement 
mm hmm 
okay  there  all clean 
 baby laughs 
i m only three   laughing 
speaking of rowley 
how s he feeling about monday 
is he looking forward
to his first day of middle school 
hmm  i m not sure 
i think he might be
a little nervous  actually 
well  he s lucky to have you
as a best friend 
you know  that s all you need to get by
in this world 
one good friend 
yeah 
and you re lucky to have a big brother
who s already gone through
the middle school experience 
right  rodrick 
 rodrick 
 huh 
take off your headphones 
you know the rule 
why don t you give greg a pep talk
about middle school 
greg s going to middle school 
yes  rodrick 
why don t you tell him
what he can expect on his first day 
okay  listen close   sighs 
here s what you need to know 
first of all  watch where you sit
on the first day of school 
because your teacher might make that
your permanent seat 
next  don t use the bathroom
on the second floor 
no matter how bad you have to go 
 there aren t any doors on those stalls 
  toilet flushes 
and finally  whatever you do 
don t get the cheese touch 
 cause if you do 
you might as well be dead 
 whimpers 
thank you  rodrick 
 for that wonderful pep talk 
  baby babbling 
greg  please forget
everything that you just heard 
especially the nonsense about the cheese 
but wha   what s the cheese touch 
it all started
in my first year of middle school 
no one knows where it came from
 or who put it there 
  boy  don t do it 
  rodrick  one day 
  girl  stay away 
 rodrick   a slice of swiss cheese
appeared on the blacktop 
 students  ew 
 rodrick  at first 
 no one would go near it 
 ugh 
  rodrick  and then one day 
 hmm 
 rodrick 
 a kid named darren walsh got curious 
  boy  no way 
  screaming 
 rodrick  and that s what started
the cheese touch 
the only way to get rid of the cheese
touch is to give it to someone else 
 screaming 
  rodrick  then one day 
  horn honks 
 a kid named abe hall moved to california 
he took the cheese touch with him 
but the cheese remained 
and to this day  it sits on the blacktop 
waiting to strike again 
 greg  well  that s terrifying 
don t let rodrick scare you  greg 
middle school s gonna be fun 
oh  and please don t mention
the   the cheese thing to rowley 
honestly 
it   it ll scare him half to death 
who s rowley 
greg s best friend 
you know  the kid who s over here
almost every single day 
 scoffs  oh  him 
i thought you were babysitting that kid 
we re the same age 
he s the same age as y  
 chuckles 
oh  man  i thought he was  like 
in kindergarten or something 
 laughs 
middle school s gonna eat him alive 
rodrick 
let me give you
one last piece of advice  greg 
middle school is every man for himself 
you don t need some overgrown baby
weighing you down 
 susan  rodrick 
that s enough 
 baby exclaims 
greg  come on  man  trust me 
cut him loose now or you both drown 
 door closes 
 video game beeping 
 video game beeps 
 you lose 
  rowley  woo hoo 
in your face  greg  that s three in a row 
wanna go again 
no  that s okay  we can shut it off 
what s the matter 
afraid to lose 
no  i m just not in the mood 
 imitating chicken clucking 
rowley  cut it out 
i mean  
don t you think
it s time to start acting our age 
but you always do the chicken thing to me 
 sighs  it s not just that  rowley 
look around this room 
all these stuffed animals  that bedspread 
and what s with this joshie guy anyway 
joshie s from europe 
and you re just jealous
because i discovered him first 
yeah  i m jealous that you discovered
some stupid pop star
whose fans are only six year old girls 
joshie says 
 follow your dreams
and respect your parents  
don t you think
it s time to grow up  rowley 
you re in middle school now 
well  not yet 
 joshie 
 be friendly to one another  yes  
come on  rowley 
middle school s no joke 
there s bullies  and bathrooms with
no stall doors  and permanent seats 
 and   and  
 and what 
and the cheese 
what s the cheese 
 susan 
please don t mention the cheese thing 
it ll scare him half to death 
you know what 
forget i said anything 
middle school s gonna be just fine 
in fact  it ll be great 
yeah   cause we re in it together 
right  greg  friends till the end 
yeah  friends till the end

 step aside  little man

greg  what do i do  what do i do 
 greg  there was no time
to worry about rowley 
because i needed to focus
on my own situation 
 sighs 
 chattering 
 grunts 
 greg  i was glad rodrick gave me
a few pointers  so i knew what not to do 
 chuckles softly 
  girl  oh  hey 
  boy  yeah  awesome 
 grunts 
uh 
  squish 
  gasps 
 whimpers 
 boy 2  exactly 
  greg  but it turns out

 greg heffley 
 huh 
 as in rodrick heffley s brother 
  boy laughs 
you ll be sitting
in the chair in front of my desk 
  greg groans 
  students laughing 
 greg chuckling 
 greg groans  oh 
  boy  bro  dude s with the weirdo 
  whimpers 
 greg  just about everything s different
from elementary school 
 chuckles 
 girl  wouldn t want to be him 
mm hmm 
 greg  and the biggest change
is who s popular and who s not 
 back in elementary school  it was simple 
  starter pistol fires 
if you were the fastest runner 
you were the most popular 
 in fifth grade 
  cheering 
 the fastest runner was ronnie mccoy 
but now  all the rules have changed 
now it s all about whether or not
you have cool hair
and how many followers
you have on social media 
in middle school 
a kid like george deveney
is at the top of the food chain 
and ronnie mccoy is scratching his head
wondering what the heck happened 
so what i m trying to figure out
is where i fit into all this 
i m sure i m not at the top of the ladder 
but at least i m not at the bottom 
 greg gasps 
does this scab smell funny to you 
 greg  but there s one way for sure
to get to the bottom 
come on 
  boy  run  yeah 
 yo  get in there for the rebound  dude 
 greg  and nobody s risking that 
  fly buzzes 
  whistle blows 
 all gasp 
what are you standing around for 
get the ball 
  girl  ew  it s so gross 
  students gagging 
 gulps 
  boy  hey  what did you get for lunch 
  girl  today i have a jacket 
 rowley  looks pretty full up 
oh  hey

maybe try the table next door 
  cell phone chimes 
 eighth graders only  newbies 
 rowley  should we sit with the girls 
we re out of our league here 
hey  over there

 hey 
  girl  band members only 
  boy  not today  guys

 girl 2  yeah

 chattering 
 laughs 
uh 
 gasps  there s two 
 greg sighs 
  playing lone note 
  chattering continues 
and another thing 
don t use the bathroom
on the second floor 
that was a big mistake 
yeah  i probably
should have warned you about that 
 piano keys clunk loudly 
 sighs 
i can t deal with this 
i need to be sitting at a table 
but you said only popular kids
get seats at the table 
 greg  well  i heard charlie davies
is getting braces next week 
so he ll definitely
drop a few spots for sure 
but that s only one spot  we need two 
 school bell ringing 
that s all the time we get 
i didn t even get to finish my juice box 
we gotta go to fifth period  rowley 
i ll meet you back here
at the door after school 
but i don t want to go back out there 
keep a low profile and you ll be fine 
think good thoughts  rowley 
good thoughts  rowley  good thoughts 
hey  greg 
after school  wanna come over and play

 greg  thankfully 
rowley did start listening to me 
we made it through
the next few weeks alive 
but by the time halloween rolled around 
rowley started to slip again 
do you think our teachers will let us
wear our costumes to school tomorrow 
no  rowley  no 
have i not taught you anything 
they had a costume parade
in elementary school 
right  elementary school 
we re in middle school now  remember 
yeah  you keep reminding me

i m trick or treating this year

and i really don t want anyone
knowing we re doing this  okay 
 i guess 
 listen  things are hard enough at school 
i just don t wanna put a target
on our backs  you know

 animal bleats 
  wings flapping

 everyone s gonna wanna sign it 
 what  they will 
yes  kids will be begging you
to sit at their lunch table 
yeah 
and i hope you ll remember
who your real friends are  rowley 
the people who helped you get
to where you are 
 yeah 
 what about your parents 
are they suspicious 
i told them i tripped on a rock
playing duck  duck  goose  like you said 
like i said 
we were playing tag  rowley 
and you tripped over the curb 
it doesn t even make sense for two people
to play duck  duck  goose  come on 
 oh  yeah  sorry 
 we gotta get our story straight 
or they re gonna find out
about the rumble trike 
did you say   rumble trike  
 gulps 
 susan  i don t know
what to do with you  greg 
first you disobey me and go to snake road 
then you play that   that game 
i told you someone
was going to get hurt playing that 
 sighs  i m sorry  mom  i just 
and now this   sighs 
lying to me is bad enough 
but telling rowley to lie to his parents
is just   just  
 sighs 
mom  i know i messed up 
you can take away my video games
for the month 
the year if it makes you feel better 
punishing you doesn t make me feel better 
greg 
i m trying to raise a good kid 
i do wanna be good  mom 
well  then here s what you need to do 
you need to figure out a way
to make things right by rowley 
you owe that to him 
that boy is such a good friend to you 
yeah  mom 
i can t tell you how to make things right 
that part is up to you 
 sighs 
 but mom 
 listen to that inner voice  greg 
i know it s in there 
do the right thing 
 door closes 
 greg  okay 
i know what my mom wanted me to do 
she wanted me to tell rowley s parents
the truth about what happened 
but here s the thing 
rowley s dad has never really liked me 
i knew if i told him what really happened 
it was just gonna make him
like me even less 
that wouldn t make things any better 
i don t wanna get rowley in trouble
for lying 
 cause then he d be in trouble too 
so  i decided the right thing to do
was to just let things be 
because telling the truth
would make things worse for everybody 
 chattering 
 ooh 
 oh  my gosh  what happened 
 it looks so cool 
 oh  you re so great 
can i sign it 
 greg  and i ll tell you another thing
that i was right about 
that cast  in fact  it worked even better
than i thought it would 
it s so cool 
 chattering 
 greg  just like i predicted  getting
a seat at lunch was no problem at all 
 sighs 
 grunts

so i decided to whip up
an injury of my own 
 chattering 
 girl gasps 
yeah  no big deal   sighs 
it s just an infection caused by
a splinter that was left untreated 
 gags 
 hey 
  screams 
can i peek at your infection 
 grunts  ew 
 greg  i realized i couldn t compete
with rowley s stupid injury 
 grunts 
so that meant i needed
to find something of my own 
and just like that  i did 
 door closes

 greg  after i turned in my comic 
all i could do was wait 
but after a whole week went by 
mr  humphreys made an announcement 
 mr  humphreys on pa  attention  students 
after careful consideration

 both laugh 
 greg  thing is  that hasn t happened yet 
rowley s been hanging out

in this world  you know 
one good friend 
 girl  somebody has the cheese touch

  boy  he has the cheese touch 
  girl  oh  ew 
 students screaming 
 boy 2  the cheese touch

 chattering 
 greg  having the cheese touch

cheese touch 
 students screaming 
 greg  the kids at school

  screams 
 greg  in fact 
i ve got a whole table to myself 
 students murmuring 
well  maybe not entirely to myself

 chattering 
and things are good with me and rowley
