wanting fresh squeezed
orange juice  no ice 
and a  spanish dancer pie 
with potato crust 
here you go 
 dear elizabeth    
do you know this column 
it s for the lonely hearts 
 dear elizabeth 
 my husband fell in love
with another woman
 from his workplace 
 i want to kill myself 
 i want to write
 the perfect suicide note
 that would let him know just
how much pain he has caused me 
 i m wondering if you can
dispense any advice
 on composing
a suicide note
 that would harm
my snake of a husband
 and his slut girlfriend the most 
yours truly   betrayed in biloxi  
elizabeth just gives her
some nonsense
about not killing herself 
i love living vicariously
through the pain and suffering
of others 
i don t believe for one second
you re as mean as you play 
you tip me better than anyone 
oh  what do you know 
bring me more water
for this empty glass 
  no 
  no  no 
mommy 
what did i say 
no 
all right  now stop it  sugar  please 
okay  you can have chocolate milk  okay 
i m sorry  you can have
as much chocolate milk as you want 
okay  all right  you little   
okay 
jenna  come on 
listen  you can have
chocolate milk  okay 
here  darling 
we bought you something 
a present 
that s sweet 
you shouldn t have 
open it 
okay 
oh  it s a book 
what a mama you re going to be 
oh  look at that 
we know you didn t initially
have a strong happiness
about this whole baby thing 
but she is coming anyway 
we don t know it s a she 
we figured we d give you something
that every woman
is supposed to read 
and every woman is supposed
to read something like that   
we think 
well  thanks 
  you best read and absorb it 
  hey  you know 
i was thinking  have you ever
heard about those people
who sell their babies
for lots of money
through  like  lawyers and stuff 
jenna  you can t sell your baby 
that s a horrible thought 
i was just thinking 
if i did  i might
make enough money
to finally get away from earl 
i mean  at this point  the baby
is the only real financial asset
i have if i don t win
that pie contest 
i am going to pretend
that you are not saying this 
not everybody wants
to be a mama  dawn 
that don t make me a bad person 
you re not getting
any more affectionate
towards that little baby 
not at all 
i respect this baby s right to thrive 
i do nothing harmful to it 
i don t drink 
i watch my diet  but no 
i feel nothing like affection 
maybe that man smothered
all the affection out of me 
i don t know 
well  i got to get back to work 
yeah  uh  breakfast crowd s
heating up 
yeah 
hey  thanks for the book 
all right 
jenna  there s all these
cool things to do in here 
um  there s a little scrapbook
section in the back 
where you can put pictures
of your pregnant belly as it develops 
oh  and there s a place where
you can write your first letter to your baby 
  oh 
  right here 
right in the middle 
okay  dawn  thanks 
first letter to my baby 
first letter 
where s my water 
dear baby   
dear baby 
if i was writing you a letter 
it would probably sound
something like an apology 
i know everyone deserves a mama
who d want a nice baby
such as yourself 
who was also a good wife 
a fine member of society 
and i can t rightly say
that i m any of that 
and i m not sure the world
is such a fine place
to be bringing you 
many of the people i ve met
are not worth meeting 
many of the things that happen
are not worth living through 
and you shouldn t take it
personal  baby 
if i don t seem like all the
other mamas to be 
jumping all over themselves
with joy 
i frankly don t know
what i got to give you  baby 
what if i leave earl and don t
win that contest next week
and don t have no money 
what the hell am i going to do
with you then 
you sure is getting fat  baby 
all my life  baby 
the only thing i ever want
to do is run away 
what kind of mama is that 
i wish i could feel other things  baby 
like excitement
that you re with me now
or faith that i ll be a good mama 
even if my life
ain t such a good place
and the world as i see it
ain t so pretty
like they d have you believe
in this book 
anyway  i m writing
this letter to you 
it sounds more like a letter
to me  don t it 
love  mama 
where you going  jenna 
nowhere  earl 
i mean  to work 
then why you got a suitcase 
earl 
shut up and get in the car 
pie baking contest  huh 
yeah  i was just going to go up there
and win and surprise you 
no  you re lying 
you ain t never gone to
a contest before in your life 
you re lying to me 
earl  don t   
why you lying to me 
i m pregnant 
when was you going to tell me 
after i won the pie contest 
well  you ain t going
to no pie contest 
you know what 
you ain t going nowhere 
here s the thing  wife 
what if you decide to love
the baby more than you love me 
women do it all the time 
they have a baby and then
it s to hell with the man 
you re jealous of the baby 
no  i don t get jealous 
it s below me 
i m just talking it out 
i m talking my feelings out 
and i know how women get 
and i m just not sure i want
that happening 
i d tell you to
get rid of it 
but i want you
in the same place
as me in the hereafter 
if you know what i mean 
maybe if you promise me
that you wouldn t love the baby
more than you love me 
you know 
that you d make
a real effort to love me more 
if i need something 
you d keep taking care of it 
you d hold on to me more 
i come first  not any baby 
well  can you make
early that promise 
absolutely 
then say  i promise  
i promise 
say   i promise i will not love the baby
more than i love you  early  
i promise i will not love the baby
more than i love you  early 
how about that 
we re going to have
ourselves a baby 
a baby boy 
i bet it happened that night
i got you all drunk 
where you going 
gotta throw up 
mrs  hunterson  the doctor will see you now

okay  just a little pressure 
now what are we looking at 
ah  there we are 
we are definitely having a baby

that flickering
right there in the middle of the screen 
yeah

  congratulations  mrs  hunterson 
  glory be  hallelujah 
uh  mrs  hunterson doesn t really like
to be congratulated

like no baby yet 
well   
ah  thank you  norma 
that s all we need you for 
all done here 
well  there you have it 
yeah 
so i guess we are officially
forgetting about that nonsense
that happened last month 
yes  we officially are 
i want to apologize for it 
i almost called you
just to apologize 
i mean  i was so
stressed out at the time 
taking on all those new patients 
i hadn t been sleeping well 
my judgment was not
what it normally is 
i want you to know
that ll never happen again 
from now on our relationship
will be strictly a medical
and professional one 
jenna  no 
not with the door open 
dear baby 
p s  i d want to be able to
teach a baby such as yourself
the difference between good and bad 
right and wrong   
   but it seems i m not fit
to teach nobody nothing 
dr  pomatter  you still in there 
you got a phone call 
i ll be right out  norma 
mrs  hunterson needs to be weighed 
would you take care of that 
and you can get dressed 
i ll see you in my office in a few minutes 
don t do that again 
okay  what  okay  i won t 
kiss you  you mean 
no  not that 
i didn t mean that 
i mean don t go away for
a full month and not call

don t do that 
this is craziness  dr  pomatter 
please  call me jim 
no  i won t 
okay  don t 
just dr  pomatter s fine 
dr  pomatter  this is so   
i don t want to have another conversation
about how crazy this is
or how sorry i am 
or how bad
my judgment is  or how i ll
never touch you again 
not only would i be lying 
but every time i start saying
those things  all that happens
is you attack me 
  you re right 
  have you been taking your
  prenatal vitamins every day 
  faithfully 
any bad morning sickness 
  not too bad  no 
  no more spotting 
  no more spotting

and deliver a baby 
because that s what i do

just about the sex   
jenna  the doctor is

oh  he s a great doctor

i don t really know 
i think so 
today we re going to do
some blood work 
it s standard stuff 
just to see how the baby s developing 
i don t care 
do i have to do it 
yeah  you have to do it 
you may be a little
weak afterwards 
so you should
call your husband
or somebody to come pick you up 
yeah  i ll call him 
is that pumpkin pie for me 
kind of 
it s just something i invented 
 naughty pumpkin pie  
hey 
you ever going to tell us
your secret  girl 
yes  i am  when i m ready 
i ve got a secret  too 
you  dawn 
yes  i have a boyfriend now 
no 
yes 
well  who is he 
tell us everything  honey 
you re never going to believe
it  but  um    you know
that guy came to the diner
that day  wouldn t leave 
name was ogie 
ogie  the stalking elf 
yeah  i remember that guy 
what about him 
well  it it s him 
well  that is wonderful  dawn 
isn t it  jenna 
yeah  that s wonderful 
how d that happen 
well  you know 
he was true to his word 
he didn t never give up 
his cousin pete gave him my number 
he called me  like 
30 times in one day 
i thought i might kill him 
but he got to me 
he did 
yeah 
well  he s so passionate 
he writes me
these spontaneous poems 
spontaneous poems 
yes  they are poems that just
occur to him right on the spot 
last night he said to me 
 dawn  your face is a brilliant
moon in my empty room  
 your love is
like a beating drum  
and yeah  i know what you re
thinking  that he s not   
so pretty    but
he grows on you 
and anyway  he s it 
 cause nobody else wants me 
well  honey  you probably
shouldn t be with someone
just  cause nobody else wants you 
yeah  well  you are 
and you wouldn t know it
to look at him 
but he is a sexual dynamo 
wow 
no  you wouldn t know it 
well  dawn 
i sure hope it s making you happy 
you don t mean that 
yes  i do 
nope 
i know what you re thinking 
 cause you called him an elf 
only  cause you initially
called him an elf 
  you re jealous 
  no 
you are 
because you have the most mean 
controlling husband
in the world 
and you are stuck there 
but i have found someone
who loves me to death 
well  let s hope not to death 
and i am happy 
good 
when the fruit pies go in 
would you put this one in with that one 
i m going to go and clean up now
and set up my station 
we ll see you out there 
don t say nothing 
i wasn t gonna 
i m not in no position
to judge nobody 
neither are you 
i hope i didn t hurt her
feelings too bad 
she ll be fine 
  hey  is cal inside yet 
  yeah  i saw him 
think it s time for me
to tell him about the baby 
you got the oven under control 
  i do 
  wish me luck 
wishing you luck  honey 
  well   
  what 
it seems i m almost
five months pregnant 
yeah  so 
so i just thought i should tell you 
i already knew 
you did 
yeah  i thought everybody knew 
oh  who told you 
nobody told me 
nobody needs to tell me 
i mean  look at you 
what d you think 
i thought you went and got fat 
truth be told 
as long as you can carry a tray
and fill a pie tin 
i don t care
if you give birth while doing it 
well  i m relieved 
i m not such a bad guy  maybe 
you re not such a bad guy  maybe 
well  get out there
and get to work  jenna 
come on  we ain t got all day 
i ll get to work 
how you doing today  joe 
same bastard as yesterday  jenna 
how are you 
same train wreck 
and how s the baby doing so far 
so far so good  no problems 
no birth defects 
no diseases  whatever 
good  good 
how s the bad husband 
just awful 
and the lipstick smudger 
the lipstick smudger 
the dog on the side 
the affair 
joe  i m not having no affair 
okay  you re not having no affair 
want to hear your horoscope
before i give you my order 
no 
too bad  here it is 
 aquarius 
 if  indeed  you re having an affair 
 it might be a good time to step back 
 look at your life
and reassess things a bit  
it don t say that in there 
yes  it does 
it says    even if you have
a miserable  snake husband 
 you probably shouldn t be
having no affair 
  cause it s beneath you
 and could make you seem
like a common hussy 
 not to mention the pain
you could cause other people  
you re just making that up 
this afternoon i want the
 singing tuna fish casserole 
no pickle on the plate 
well done frenchie fries
with melted swiss cheese
and gravy on their own plate 
and  jenna s special strawberry
chocolate oasis pie  
you got that 
i got that 
give me a smile  jenna 
nobody makes strawberry
chocolate pie the way you do 
wednesday s my favorite day
of the week 
 cause i get to have a slice of it 
i think about it as i m waking up 
could solve all the problems
with the world  that pie 
you re making too much of it 
it s just a pie 
just a pie 
it s downright expert 
a thing of beauty 
how each flavor opens itself 
one by one 
like a chapter in a book 
first the flavor
of an exotic spice hits you 
just a hint of it 
and then you re flooded with
chocolate  dark and bittersweet 
like an old love affair 
and finally  strawberry 
the way strawberry was always
supposed to taste 
but never knew how 
in fact 
i tell you what 
forget all the other stuff
i ordered 
just bring me the damn pie 
that s all i want 
i don t care if it s not
a well balanced meal 
just bring me the pie 
old joe ll maybe not have much
longer to live  you know 
then i better bring you the pie

curses constantly
and sleeps in a separate room 
so why don t you
just divorce him then 
i can t just leave
a sick  crazy  old man 
what kind of person would do that 
i don t know  what kind of person
has an affair with cal 
who s married to ethel 
who we see all the time 
he says she s awful 
maybe anyone
you stay married to
for 15 years starts to seem awful 
but we know ethel 
she s not awful 
she tells cal not to yell at us 
hey  you re supposed
to be my friend  not ethel s 
having an affair
is a terrible thing to do 
it destroys people s lives  and i don t
want you messed up with all that

and teach me everything
she knew about baking 
she d sing to me so sweetly 
baby  don t you cry 
gonna make a pie
gonna make a pie
with a heart in the middle
baby  don t be blue 
gonna make for you
gonna make a pie with
a heart in the middle
gonna be a pie
from heaven above
gonna be filled
with strawberry love
baby  don t you cry 
gonna make a pie
hold you forever in
the middle of my heart 
you are so beautiful 
no  i m not 
you are 
i m fat 
you re pregnant 
you ve got a little baby
growing inside you 
there is nothing more beautiful 
it s an alien and a parasite 
it makes me tired and weak 
it complicates my whole life 
i resent it 
i have no idea
how to take care of it 
i m the anti mother 
i don t want to talk
about that no more 
i want to know
what the hell you re doing here 
i m learning how to make
 lonely chicago pie  
no  i mean what you re doing here 
living in this town 
my wife 
she just finished med school and
we came here for her residency 
are you happy with her 
no  don t answer that 
i m happy right now 
being here with you 
that s a good answer 
you make me feel calm 
you make me feel peaceful 
i don t feel that much 
i tend to be neurotic 
and you re so beautiful 
keep going 
and so sexy 
more  please 
and i could find
the whole meaning of life
in those sad eyes 
wow 
dear baby 
somewhere in the space
between the pie baking
and earl eating it
later that night 
began the most intimate
conversation of my life 
about my mama 
about how much she loved me 
how sad she d be to see my life
turned out like this 
about earl and how he changed
after we married 
became someone i feared 
about how lonely it is to be
a woman so poor and so afraid 
and then i was addicted  baby 
i was addicted
to saying things
and having them matter to someone 
mm 
i ve never had a real best friend before 
except for my mama 
you feel like a best friend 
i have something for you 
a present 
a present for me

any more problems

thing i ve ever seen

i can t buy you nothing back 
i don t want you to buy me anything 
why d you give this
to me  dr  pomatter 
you know why

because i am falling
head over heels   
we re gathered here today
to celebrate the love
between ogie anhorn
and dawn williams   
to join them together
in holy matrimony for
the rest of their natural lives
