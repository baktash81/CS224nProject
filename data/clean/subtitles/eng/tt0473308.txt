the perfect suicide note
that would let him know just
how much pain he has caused me
im wondering if you can
dispense any advice
on composing
a suicide note
that would harm
my snake of a husband
and his slut girlfriend the most
yours truly  betrayed in biloxi
elizabeth just gives her
some nonsense
about not killing herself
i love living vicariously
through the pain and suffering
of others
i dont believe for one second

you tip me better than anyone
oh what do you know

that pie contest
i am going to pretend
that you are not saying this

youre not getting
any more affectionate
towards that little baby
not at all
i respect this babys right to thrive
i do nothing harmful to it
i dont drink
i watch my diet but no
i feel nothing like affection
maybe that man smothered
all the affection out of me
i dont know

dear baby
if i was writing you a letter
it would probably sound
something like an apology
i know everyone deserves a mama
whod want a nice baby
such as yourself
who was also a good wife
a fine member of society
and i cant rightly say
that im any of that
and im not sure the world
is such a fine place
to be bringing you
many of the people ive met
are not worth meeting
many of the things that happen
are not worth living through
and you shouldnt take it
personal baby
if i dont seem like all the
other mamastobe
jumping all over themselves
with joy
i frankly dont know
what i got to give you baby
what if i leave earl and dont
win that contest next week
and dont have no money
what the hell am i going to do
with you then
you sure is getting fat baby
all my life baby
the only thing i ever want
to do is run away
what kind of mama is that
i wish i could feel other things baby
like excitement
that youre with me now
or faith that ill be a good mama
even if my life
aint such a good place
and the world as i see it
aint so pretty
like theyd have you believe
in this book
anyway im writing
this letter to you
it sounds more like a letter
to me dont it
love mama
where you going jenna
nowhere earl
i mean to work
then why you got a suitcase
earl
shut up and get in the car
piebaking contest huh
yeah i was just going to go up there
and win and surprise you
no youre lying
you aint never gone to
a contest before in your life
youre lying to me
earl dont
why you lying to me
im pregnant
when was you going to tell me
after i won the pie contest
well you aint going
to no pie contest
you know what
you aint going nowhere
heres the thing wife
what if you decide to love
the baby more than you love me
women do it all the time
they have a baby and then
its to hell with the man
youre jealous of the baby
no i dont get jealous
its below me
im just talking it out
im talking my feelings out
and i know how women get
and im just not sure i want
that happening
id tell you to
get rid of it
but i want you
in the same place
as me in the hereafter
if you know what i mean
maybe if you promise me
that you wouldnt love the baby
more than you love me
you know
that youd make
a real effort to love me more
if i need something
youd keep taking care of it
youd hold on to me more
i come first not any baby
well can you make
early that promise
absolutely
then say i promise
i promise
say  i promise i will not love the baby
more than i love you early
i promise i will not love the baby
more than i love you early
how about that
were going to have
ourselves a baby
a baby boy
i bet it happened that night
i got you all drunk

and professional one
jenna no

dr pomatter this is so
i dont want to have another conversation
about how crazy this is

he writes me
these spontaneous poems
spontaneous poems
yes they are poems that just
occur to him right on the spot
last night he said to me
dawn your face is a brilliant
moon in my empty room
your love is
like a beating drum
and yeah i know what youre
thinking that hes not
so pretty but
he grows on you
and anyway hes it
cause nobody else wants me
well honey you probably
shouldnt be with someone
just cause nobody else wants you
yeah well you are
and you wouldnt know it
to look at him
but he is a sexual dynamo
wow
no you wouldnt know it
well dawn
i sure hope its making you happy
you dont mean that
yes i do
nope
i know what youre thinking
cause you called him an elf
only cause you initially
called him an elf
youre jealous

controlling husband
in the world
and you are stuck there
but i have found someone
who loves me to death
well lets hope not to death

the affair
joe im not having no affair
okay youre not having no affair
want to hear your horoscope

too bad here it is
aquarius
if indeed youre having an affair
it might be a good time to step back
look at your life
and reassess things a bit
it dont say that in there
yes it does
it says  even if you have
a miserable snake husband
you probably shouldnt be
having no affair
cause its beneath you
and could make you seem
like a common hussy
not to mention the pain
you could cause other people
youre just making that up
this afternoon i want the
singing tuna fish casserole
no pickle on the plate
welldone frenchie fries
with melted swiss cheese
and gravy on their own plate
and jennas special strawberry
chocolate oasis pie

nobody makes strawberry
chocolate pie the way you do
wednesdays my favorite day
of the week
cause i get to have a slice of it
i think about it as im waking up
could solve all the problems
with the world that pie
youre making too much of it
its just a pie
just a pie
its downright expert
a thing of beauty
how each flavor opens itself
one by one
like a chapter in a book
first the flavor
of an exotic spice hits you
just a hint of it
and then youre flooded with
chocolate dark and bittersweet
like an old love affair
and finally strawberry
the way strawberry was always
supposed to taste
but never knew how
in fact
i tell you what
forget all the other stuff
i ordered
just bring me the damn pie
thats all i want
i dont care if its not
a wellbalanced meal
just bring me the pie

i cant just leave
a sick crazy old man
what kind of person would do that
i dont know what kind of person

for 15 years starts to seem awful
but we know ethel
shes not awful
she tells cal not to yell at us

to be my friend not ethels
having an affair
is a terrible thing to do
