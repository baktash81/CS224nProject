welcome to sheffield 
the beating heart
of britain s industriainorth 
the jewel in yorkshire s crown
is home to over halfa million people    
  and thousands more

  and workshops employ some 90 000 men   
  and state of the art machinery
to make the world s finest steel 
from high tensile girders   
  to the stainless cutlery
for your dining table 
but it s not all hard work
for the people of steel city 
they can spend the day
lounging by the pool    
  watching one of our top soccer teams    
  or browsing in the shops 
but when the sun goes down 
the fun really starts   
  in the city s numerous
night clubs and discotheques

how to have a good time 
and it s good times
for the city s housing  too

victorian slums have been cleared
to make way for the homes of the future
