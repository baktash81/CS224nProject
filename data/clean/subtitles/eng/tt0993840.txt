thousands of protesters
marched on the capitol this morning
in response to yesterdays
historic congressional vote
that narrowly ratified
the controversial proposal
to wipe out the last remains
of the socalled zombie wars
which drew to a dramatic end
with the us military
suffering massive casualties
and being forced to retreat
as vegas was walled off with the zombies
left inside to haunt the abandoned city
this will mark the culmination
of the presidents efforts
to fulfill his campaign promise
to exterminate
las vegas undead population
by taking the extreme action of dropping
a lowyield tactical nuclear bomb
on the city of las vegas
in four days time
coinciding with sunset
on the fourth of july holiday
the executive order
has prompted the full evacuation
of the mccarran quarantine camp
which has long been
the target of civil rights groups
who have argued
that no evidence of infection
has been detected in the camp
excuse me
may i talk to that gentleman please
hey scott you got a visitor
mr ward
hey youre bly tanaka right
you want to see me
its not every man
who saves the secretary of defense
from a horde of flesheating monsters
earns the medal of freedom
only to end up
working at a burger joint
mr tanaka
i am well aware of my situation
heres the thing
theres 200 million
in the basement vault beneath the strip
two hundred million the insurance company
already reimbursed me for
untaxable untraceable
unspendable
thats where you come in
with 96 hours left
the government has already moved
more than half of its military presence
out of the quarantine zone
which makes it vulnerable
i want you to put together
a team and get it out
in exchange
50 million is yours to divvy up
amongst whomever you take in with you
intrigued
dont give me an answer
think on it for the night
in good faith
well talk soon mr ward
you should just be happy
that this is essentially
a governmentfunded health care solution
that will put an end to all of this
come on sean
you know theyre not infected
if they were
they would be zombies already
theyre political prisoners
just people the government
doesnt want on the streets
you know as well as i do if you have
questionable immigration status
advocate for gay rights or abortion
the next thing you know
they have a temperature gun at your head
or dragging you out
of your house or your car
under the guise of public safety
weve tested
thousands of nukes in the nevada desert
this is no different
attention detainees
of las vegas mccarran quarantine camp
this facility is in an active evacuation
board the shuttle bus for barstow
have your current
temporary health clearance card
to present to officials
as you board the shuttle
reminder shuttles
will be leaving every 15 minutes
hey guys
kate
hi i cant breathe
you guys excited for the big move
yeah
kate let the kids finish packing
go on come on
kate i need you to promise me something
in case anything
happens to me in the next few days
just make sure
the kids make it out to barstow okay
what do you mean what could happen
you know her dont you
the coyote
geeta that is not an option
kate
she helps people get in
crack a slot machine slip back out
before anyone even knows youre gone
that money is our ticket out of here
or well be trapped in barstow forever

they dont give a shit
but for five grand
i can buy my way out me and my kids
i have to get the kids out by friday
and i will do
whatever it takes to protect my family
geeta people that go in there

anything better to do
kate

she didnt say anything
is that right volunteer
kate
shut the fuck up shut the fuck up
okay
what were you saying something to me

no i didnt say anything
you know the first sign
of infection is belligerence
and actions outside of social norms
look at me and hold still
clear
volunteers
and temporary workers
employee shuttles leave in five minutes
your turn
if you want
i could use my rectal thermometer
oh
youre down a couple of decimal points
you sure youre feeling all right
you sure youre not infected
i im fine
im fine im i feel fine
well
youre both within
the margin of error but watch it
you better be on that bus volunteer
asshole
what were you thinking
do you know how easy it would be
for him to make you disappear
all he has to say
is that you dropped a degree
and nobody would question it nobody
i know im
you know
i just he
look it doesnt matter
im sorry i just
i need you to promise me
that youre not gonna do anything stupid
geeta its its not worth the risk
no youre right
i wont
i promise okay

come on scotty
its not a matter of think
its a matter of is
and it is a bad goddamn idea
youre out
i didnt say that
youre in
i didnt say that either
but youre intrigued
that much im guessing
your ass knew before you even walked in
i mean think about it
everything we did
all those people we saved
look what it got us
but what if what if just once
we did something just for us
we could die
yeah well probably die
hmm
some of us at least
fifty million dollars
fifty million
whats the split even however many ways
figured you me and vanderohe will take
15 million each assuming hell do it
everybody else who isnt family
nobody needs to know our cut
now youre getting it
who else
is on your crazyass list
so i see you had a visitor
talk to me howd it go
well first time shes come
to visit me in six months
we cant make small talk
for more than 35 minutes
without it turning into a fight
still she seems happy
thats what matters i suppose
im sure that she appreciates you
even if you dont realize it
mmm
i mean it
and if she doesnt screw her
thats uh some heavy shit
so wheres your head at
you know when we were in it
like when we were really in it
i never thought about the faces
of all the countless monsters
but now just realized you know
were people
but now their faces
thats all i see
i dont know if being back in
would be better or worse
god i cant figure that out
but i guess
there is a chance that it could be
cathartic
there it is
would you look at that
they should have
nuked vegas in the early 90s but
this is great
peters

the vegas bly
you cant fly into vegas
its restricted airspace

there is an abandoned rescue helicopter
on top of the north tower sodom
if you coordinate and communicate
this should be a simple inandout
you will enter the city
with a 32hour window
whatever zombies are still walking
should be no problem for a gang
of tough hombres such as yourselves

my apologies
how precisely do we do the zombie killing
oh jesus

its all about the brain
brain
one comes at you shoot it in the brain
its that simple any questions

and smashed it into the head
would would that work
yeah yeah that uh
that also would still be targeting
the brain so that would work
copy that
sorry mr tanaka please continue
from there
you move down the strip
youll reach the casino
in less than two hours
you go in and find the generator
the safe
beneath the south tower gomorrah
is at the end of a hallway
there youll find
several nonlethal deterrents
youll have to find a way to trigger them
meanwhile
our fearless pilotslashmechanic
fuels the helicopter
back at the main door
our safecracker gets to work
like a surgeon or a painter
his masterpiece rendered
in barely audible clicks
finally she succumbs
to the sheer dominance
of his gentle touch
then all you have to do
is load the money on the helicopter
and fly off into the sunset
all this
a full day before the nuke
ever leaves the launchpad
easy peasy japanesey

she just shot me shoot her
theyll know were here they wont care
so long as we play by their rules
rules de qué habla esta pendeja
o sea estáloca
if we wanna go further
we have to make a trade
trade really
no trade
yes an offering to show our subservience
they dont think
shoot this bitch
if they come we kill them
you dont understand
theyre not what you think they are
shoot her in the face
were not talking about shamblers here
youre right they dont think
they just move and eat
but were talking about the other ones
the alphas
yes theyre smarter theyre faster
theyre organized
straight out of your fucking nightmares
please
you all keep talking
about the city like its their prison
its not its their kingdom
they wont mind us
poking around the outside
so long as we play by their rules
oh my god
were moving into the heart of it now
i have a mother i love her
well everyone has a mom you cunt

lording power over quarantined women
shes lying

yep as shamblers
no
my theory this started
with one of them an original
oh my god no
whoever that is if he bites you
then you become an alpha
exactly
looks like
theyre taking him to the olympus
good now we know where not to go
ive never figured out
exactly how it works
all i know is they take you in there
and you come out like one of them
one of the fast ones
so theyre taking him there to turn him
yes
scott that could be where geeta is
kate weve already talked about this
we have time
its not an option
fine
thats what i thought
so the shithead
buys us passage and we keep going
well yeah
the shithead should buy us some goodwill
but im not about to flaunt it
by walking on their streets
if we want to go further we go indoors
allez lets go
hey uh has there been
any thought given to triage
what do you mean
well i mean obviously
the german is the most important person
cause he can open the safe
but barring that
its got to be me right
because without me
you cant fly the chopper out of here
so that would make me
second most important
and i dont know if you two
are tied for third or whatever
but im certainly
more important than that guy
sorry i didnt know
you were listening i am way
okay i am definitely
more important than that guy
i dont trust that guy
you know why he was hired
he was hired to keep tabs on us
for when we open the safe
that we didnt take the money and run
we should be incentivized
im not trying to be the bad guy

of fighting and dying
fighting and dying
fighting and dying and tanaka
the puppet master
devil god

and the rest of the team
simply pawns in some perverse play
where were destined
to repeat our failures
and finally
in some mindbending ironic reveal
it all begins again

the first pressure trigger is
its some kind of a booby trap trust me

one of these things is worth to my boss

im okay
yeah
um um
can you help me mr vanderohe
yeah absolutely
thank you
one two three
if i can open it
it will be either destruction or renewal
death or rebirth
thats heavy brother but i dig it
the decision came down to the wire
but ultimately the president caved
to the pressures to move the date
of the bombing off of the holiday
this marked a reversal
of his earlier position
that dropping the nuke
on the fourth would be quote
really cool
and the ultimate fireworks show
and quote actually kind
of patriotic if you think about it
due to fears that
mounting anger from humanitarian groups
would cause the bombing
to be postponed indefinitely
the administration
has made the dramatic choice
to not postpone the bombing
but rather to move it up
by a full 24 hours
the fuck
the scheduled drop time
now coming at sunset tonight
stay with us
mother of god
are you fucking kidding me
what
keep checking back
with us here
in related news
its insane
the international society
of elvis impersonators
think that kid
has that safe open yet
better get out of here
peters
yeah
we got a problem
they moved the bomb up
oh nice im glad they decided
to move the nuclear bomb up
i was getting kind of antsy
weve got about 90 minutes
before this place is dust
hows it going up there
good i actually found a pool
been working on my tan
