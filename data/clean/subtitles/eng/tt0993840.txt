thousands of protesters
marched on the capitol this morning
in response to yesterday s
historic congressional vote
that narrowly ratified
the controversial proposal
to wipe out the last remains
of the so called zombie wars 
which drew to a dramatic end
with the us military
suffering massive casualties
and being forced to retreat
as vegas was walled off with the zombies
left inside to haunt the abandoned city 
this will mark the culmination
of the president s efforts
to fulfill his campaign promise
to exterminate
las vegas  undead population
by taking the extreme action of dropping
a low yield tactical nuclear bomb
on the city of las vegas
in four days  time 
coinciding with sunset
on the fourth of july holiday 
the executive order
has prompted the full evacuation
of the mccarran quarantine camp 
which has long been
the target of civil rights groups
who have argued
that no evidence of infection
has been detected in the camp 
excuse me 
may i talk to that gentleman  please 
hey  scott  you got a visitor 
mr  ward 
hey  you re bly tanaka  right 
you want to see me 
it s not every man
who saves the secretary of defense
from a horde of flesh eating monsters 
earns the medal of freedom 
only to end up 
working at a burger joint 
mr  tanaka 
i am well aware of my situation 
here s the thing 
there s  200 million
in the basement vault beneath the strip 
two hundred million the insurance company
already reimbursed me for 
un taxable  untraceable 
un spendable 
that s where you come in 
with 96 hours left 
the government has already moved
more than half of its military presence
out of the quarantine zone 
which makes it vulnerable 
i want you to put together
a team and get it out 
in exchange 
50 million is yours to divvy up
amongst whomever you take in with you 
intrigued 
don t give me an answer 
think on it for the night 
in good faith 
we ll talk soon  mr  ward 
you should just be happy
that this is essentially
a government funded health care solution
that will put an end to all of this 
come on  sean 
you know they re not infected 
if they were 
they would be zombies already 
they re political prisoners 
just people the government
doesn t want on the streets 
you know as well as i do  if you have
questionable immigration status 
advocate for gay rights or abortion 
the next thing you know 
they have a temperature gun at your head
or dragging you out
of your house or your car
under the guise of public safety 
we ve tested
thousands of nukes in the nevada desert 
this is no different 
attention detainees
of las vegas mccarran quarantine camp 
this facility is in an active evacuation 
board the shuttle bus for barstow 
have your current
temporary health clearance card
to present to officials
as you board the shuttle 
reminder  shuttles
will be leaving every 15 minutes 
  hey  guys 
  kate 
hi  i can t breathe 
  you guys excited for the big move 
  yeah 
kate  let the kids finish packing 
go on  come on

you know her  don t you 
the coyote 
geeta  that is not an option 
kate 
she helps people get in 
crack a slot machine  slip back out 
before anyone even knows  you re gone 
that money is our ticket out of here 
or we ll be trapped in barstow forever 
listen  these guards 
they don t give a shit 
but for five grand 
i can buy my way out  me and my kids 
i have to get the kids out by friday 
and i will do
whatever it takes to protect my family 
geeta  people that go in there

  kate 
shut the fuck up  shut the fuck up 
okay 
what  were you saying something to me 
don t

you know  the first sign
of infection is belligerence
and actions outside of social norms 
look at me and hold still 
clear 
volunteers
and temporary workers 
employee shuttles leave in five minutes 
your turn 
if you want 
i could use my rectal thermometer 
oh

you sure you re feeling all right 
  you sure you re not infected 
  i  i m fine 
i m fine  i m  i feel fine 
well 
you re both within
the margin of error  but watch it 
you better be on that bus  volunteer 
asshole 
what were you thinking 
do you know how easy it would be
for him to make you disappear 
all he has to say
is that you dropped a degree 
and nobody would question it  nobody 
  i know  i m 
  you know 
i just  he 
look  it doesn t matter 
i m sorry  i just 
i need you to promise me
that you re not gonna do anything stupid

a helicopter pilot and a safecracker 
i m gonna text you an address

sharkey  give her the white loaner 
  gracias  maria 
  say hi to the kids 
okay  bye 
fuck 
hey 
hey 
so you think it s a bad idea 
come on  scotty 
it s not a matter of  think  
it s a matter of  is  
and it is a bad goddamn idea 
  you re out 
  i didn t say that 
you re in 
i didn t say that either 
but you re intrigued 
that much i m guessing
your ass knew before you even walked in 
i mean  think about it 
everything we did 
all those people we saved 
look what it got us 
but what if  what if just once 
we did something just for us 
we could die 
yeah  we ll probably die 
hmm 
some of us at least 
fifty million dollars 
fifty million 
what s the split  even however many ways 
figured you  me  and vanderohe will take
15 million each  assuming he ll do it 
everybody else who isn t family 
nobody needs to know our cut 
now you re getting it 
who else
is on your crazy ass list 
so i see you had a visitor 
talk to me  how d it go 
well  first time she s come
to visit me in six months 
we can t make small talk
for more than 35 minutes
without it turning into a fight 
still  she seems happy 
that s what matters  i suppose 
i m sure that she appreciates you 
even if you don t realize it 
  mmm 
  i mean it 
and if she doesn t   screw her 
that s  uh  some heavy shit 
so where s your head at 
you know  when we were in it 
like  when we were really in it 
i never thought about the faces
of all the countless monsters
but now just realized  you know 
were people 
but now their faces 
that s all i see 
i don t know if being back in
would be better or worse 
god  i can t figure that out 
but i guess
there is a chance that it could be 
cathartic 
there it is 
would you look at that 
they should have
nuked vegas in the early  90s  but 
  this is great 
  peters 
holy shit 
what s up 
what the hell brings you here 
how s the job 
sucks ass  what re you guys doing here

yeah  what does it pay 
well  if it pans out 
you make two million dollars
for one day s work 
  two million dollars 
  but   
that s my share  just for me 
two million dollars if it pans out 
hundred percent  i m in  yeah 
you don t want to know the risks or   
why would i want to know the risks 
two million dollars  that s a lot of cash 
listen  i hate my life so deeply 
if i had two million dollars 
my life would change drastically 
yeah  thank you  yes 
you sure you don t want to know 
uh

to do with a helicopter

mr  tanaka  team s all here 
lovely to have you
all gathered here today 
meet your target 
the vegas bly 
you can t fly into vegas 
it s restricted airspace 
but you can fly out 
there is an abandoned rescue helicopter
on top of the north tower  sodom 
if you coordinate and communicate 
this should be a simple in and out 
you will enter the city
with a 32 hour window 
whatever zombies are still walking
should be no problem for a gang
of tough hombres such as yourselves 
wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait 
my apologies 
how precisely do we do the zombie killing 
oh  jesus 
is there anybody else here
who hasn t killed a zombie 
well  we all know the basics 
zombies  shamblers  the undead 
whatever you wanna call them 
when it comes to killing them 
it s all about the brain 
brain 
one comes at you  shoot it in the brain 
it s that simple  any questions 
yes  what if i took a big rock
and smashed it into the head 
would  would that work 
yeah  yeah  that  uh 
that also would still be targeting
the brain  so that would work 
copy that 
sorry  mr  tanaka  please continue 
from there 
you move down the strip 
you ll reach the casino
in less than two hours 
you go in and find the generator 
the safe 
beneath the south tower  gomorrah 
is at the end of a hallway 
there  you ll find
several nonlethal deterrents 
you ll have to find a way to trigger them 
meanwhile 
our fearless pilot slash mechanic
fuels the helicopter 
back at the main door 
our safecracker gets to work 
like a surgeon or a painter 
his masterpiece rendered
in barely audible clicks 
finally  she succumbs
to the sheer dominance
of his gentle touch 
then  all you have to do
is load the money on the helicopter
and fly off into the sunset 
all this 
 a full day before the nuke
ever leaves the launchpad 
easy peasy japanese y 
sorry  sir 
we re not allowed to say that anymore

she just shot me  shoot her 
they ll know we re here  they won t care
so long as we play by their rules 
  rules  de qué habla esta pendeja 
  o sea  estáloca 
if we wanna go further 
we have to make a trade 
  trade  really 
  no trade 
yes  an offering to show our subservience 
  they don t think 
  shoot this bitch 
  if they come  we kill them 
  you don t understand 
  they re not what you think they are 
  shoot her in the face 
we re not talking about shamblers here 
you re right  they don t think 
they just move and eat 
but we re talking about the other ones 
  the alphas 
  yes  they re smarter  they re faster 
they re organized 
straight out of your fucking nightmares 
please 
you all keep talking
about the city like it s their prison 
it s not  it s their kingdom 
they won t mind us
poking around the outside
so long as we play by their rules 
  oh my god 
  we re moving into the heart of it now 
i have a mother  i love her 
well  everyone has a mom  you cunt 
but not everyone is an abuser
lording power over quarantined women 
she s lying 
that s not true 
shut your mouth 
i ve seen what you ve done to those women 
you fucking rapist 
oh my god 
that s not true at all 
  oh  fuck  no  no 
  she s coming 
who s coming  what s coming 
  she  what s she 
  no  please  we bonded  please 
no  no  no  no  don t trust her 
  sorry 
  no  please

what the 
what  what the fuck 
scheisse 
help  shoot this 
what the fuck is this thing 
listen  no  no  hi 
i m not here to hurt you 
come on 
help me  help me  help me  help me 
no  no  no  no  no  no 
help me 
don t do it  just stay away 
what are you doing 
no  oh my god 
go away  go over there  go over there 
no 
help  no 
  you ever seen her kill anyone 
  couple times 
no 
did they come back 
yep  as shamblers 
no 
my theory  this started
with one of them  an original 
oh  my god  no 
whoever that is  if he bites you   
  then you become an alpha 
  exactly 
looks like
they re taking him to the olympus 
good  now we know where not to go 
i ve never figured out
exactly how it works 
all i know is they take you in there 
and you come out like one of them 
one of the fast ones 
  so  they re taking him there to turn him 
  yes 
scott  that could be where geeta is 
kate  we ve already talked about this 
  we have time 
  it s not an option 
fine 
that s what i thought 
so  the shithead
buys us passage  and we keep going 
well  yeah 
the shithead should buy us some goodwill 
but i m not about to flaunt it
by walking on their streets 
if we want to go further  we go indoors 
allez  let s go 
hey  uh  has there been
any thought given to triage 
what do you mean 
well  i mean  obviously 
the german is the most important person
 cause he can open the safe 
but barring that 
it s got to be me  right 
because without me 
you can t fly the chopper out of here 
so that would make me
second most important 
and i don t know if you two
are tied for third or whatever 
but i m certainly
more important than that guy 
sorry  i didn t know
you were listening  i am way 
okay  i am definitely
more important than that guy 
i don t trust that guy 
you know why he was hired 
he was hired to keep tabs on us
for when we open the safe 
that we didn t take the money and run 
we should be incentivized 
i m not trying to be the bad guy 
but we should be incentivized
to let him die 
what  what s everybody looking at me for 
it s a free country 
people can look at whoever they want 
actually  it s not a free country 
we re not in america anymore 
haven t you heard 
which technically makes it
an even freer country  right 
whatever 
what the fuck is this 
stay away from me 
what the fuck 
what is that 
no 
hey 
hey  let me talk to you for a second 
i can help you  just let me   
okay  okay 
what the fuck 
no 
no 
no  no  no 
okay  okay  look 
let s just talk turkey for a second  i   
oh  shit 
don t touch them 
don t shine the light in their eyes 
i ve seen this before 
they re hibernating 
if we can t see them 
how are we supposed to move forward 
i ll mark us a path 
go for it 
why  you want to check out my ass 
no  i don t trust you
to have our backs if shit goes bad 
i ve been watching you 
and you re up to something 
when we all get to the casino 
i think we need
to have a little conversation
about what exactly your role is here 
knock yourself out 
gotcha  bitch 
you motherfucker 
bitch 
fuck 
this way 
  where s chambers 
  she was right behind me 
  what happened  what did you do 
  i didn t do anything 
she started shooting 
i wasn t close to her 
bullshit  she was back there
with you  i know she was 
  buddy 
  what happened 
  you don t want to   
  motherfucker 
she s gone  come on 
leave her  she s dead 
chambers  chambers 
come on 
go 
run  run 
guz  come on  let s go 
guzman  guz  she s gone 
we gotta move  come on  move 
lilly 
there s no way geeta s alive  right 
i mean  look at these things 
don t be so sure  i brought a guy in once 
lost sight of him 
had to leave him  i thought he was dead 
then three days later 
he came walking back out 
what happened to him 
said they took him to the olympus 
shoved him in a room
with two other people 
the leader  he came for them one by one 
if my guy hadn t escaped 
he would have been next 
so that s a pretty common theme for you 
leaving people behind 
do you think
i enjoy having to leave people 
i m doing what i can to make things right 
sir 
come here  look at this 
the hell 
is that 
yeah  another set
of blueprints to the safe 
another set of blueprints 
slimy bastard  tanaka 
tanaka had other teams here before us 
do you know anything about this 
that s news to me 
peters  get up to the roof 
get that chopper running
as fast as possible  cruz  go with her 
she talks too much 
look  i m excited
to see my friends again  okay 
sue me

that mom kate s looking for

i ve never left anyone i didn t have to
or who didn t deserve it 
you have no idea
what i ve seen in those camps 
what those people have to do to survive 
at least within these walls 
the rules are clear 
you don t see them
fucking each other over 
if you screw me 
two between the eyes 
two  why two 
the second one s just for fun 
ah  shit 
what happens now 
we wait 
you understand
that i had to do it  right 
do what 
put her down 
you know  all those things
they were saying  about me after 
  i want to make sure you know i loved her 
  yeah 
we loved each other 
if i ever made it seem
like that wasn t the case  i m sorry 
i got it  it s okay 
  you do 
  yes 
you did what you had to do 
she was one of them  it 
it s fine  okay 
wait 
you think that s why i haven t
been talking to you all these years

  seemed like the logical assumption  yeah 
  no 
what you did and what happened to her 
i never blamed you for that  ever 
well  i don t  i don t get it 
if it wasn t what happened 
what the hell was it 
it s not the 
it s not the fact that 
you killed my mother 
it s that you never showed up after  okay 
you 
you weren t there  scott 
you didn t call  you didn t visit 
you didn t  talk about it 
you didn t comfort me 
yeah  you re right 
it s  cause every time i looked at you 
i just saw her and 
it hurt like hell 
hurt like hell 
and then when i tried
to come back around  you just 
you seemed like you didn t want me there 
so i assumed i should stay gone 
you know  maybe
there s a chance we could still 
still what 
i don t know 
maybe you could look
into college somewhere 
we shouldn t need money 
i could open a restaurant 
a new food truck 
just have a life 
i was thinking  uh 
i was thinking
artisan grilled cheese sandwiches 
artisan grilled cheese 
yeah  what do you think 
mmm 
yeah  uh 
i don t know 
it s a  it s a nice idea  but 
i ve spent so long hating you
that i can t just turn that off 
i m sorry  i m sorry 
  that came out meaner than i meant it to 
  no  it s all right

they tried to cut their way in 
that s so stupid 
you stupid poor skeletons 
no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
oh  no  all they managed to do
is to screw up the card reader 
is it another team 
or is it us  dieter 
  huh 
  think about it  us 
i mean  look at them  it s us 
it could be us in another timeline 
and we re caught
in some infinite loop
of fighting and dying 
fighting and dying 
fighting and dying  and tanaka 
the puppet master 
devil  god 
and we  you  me  guz 
and the rest of the team 
simply pawns in some perverse play
where we re destined
to repeat our failures 
and finally 
in some mind bending  ironic reveal 
it all begins again 
cool 
boom 
amazing 
there 
that s where
the first pressure trigger is 
it s some kind of a booby trap  trust me 
if we could find something to trigger it 
  there 
  i see 
by the way  i love your hair 
thanks 
oh  god

okay  yeah 
no  no 
no 
what are you doing 
you said
you just needed a vial of her blood 
well  forget blood 
you know how much the whole head of
one of these things is worth to my boss 
to the government 
mwah 
in the right hands 
this is the power to make more of them 
the power to control your own zombie army 
that s the ultimate wmd 
this isn t what we agreed to 
well  you want your deal or not 
huh 
that s what i thought 
so you keep your goddamn mouth shut 
okay  we need to go 
why  they gonna come looking
for her if she doesn t radio back to base 
her death cry  they ll have heard it 
once they find her body  our trade is off 
what are they gonna do 
i don t know

what  that s it 
oh  wow  that s so scary 
oh  scheisse 
fuck 
that was supposed to be nonlethal 
  that has to be illegal  right 
  good old tanaka 
guess he wasn t screwing around 
so is that it  dieter  huh

good luck with that

you filthy piece of shit 
fuck 
oh  um 
you okay there  dieter 
  i m okay 
  yeah 
um  um 
can you help me  mr  vanderohe 
  yeah  absolutely 
  thank you 
one  two  three 
if i can open it 
it will be either destruction or renewal 
death  or rebirth 
that s heavy  brother  but i dig it 
the decision came down to the wire 
but ultimately  the president caved
to the pressures to move the date
of the bombing off of the holiday 
this marked a reversal
of his earlier position
that dropping the nuke
on the fourth would be  quote 
 really cool
and the ultimate fireworks show  
and quote   actually kind
of patriotic if you think about it  
due to fears that
mounting anger from humanitarian groups
would cause the bombing
to be postponed indefinitely 
the administration
has made the dramatic choice
to not postpone the bombing
but rather to move it up
by a full 24 hours 
the fuck 
the scheduled drop time
now coming at sunset tonight 
  stay with us 
  mother of god 
are you fucking kidding me 
what 
keep checking back
with us here 
  in related news 
  it s insane 
 the international society
of elvis impersonators 
think that kid
has that safe open yet 
better get out of here 
peters 
yeah 
we got a problem 
they moved the bomb up 
oh  nice  i m glad they decided
to move the nuclear bomb up 
i was getting kind of antsy 
we ve got about 90 minutes
before this place is dust 
how s it going up there 
good  i actually found a pool 
been working on my tan 
gotta even this shit out 
you know what i m talking about 
how s it going over there 
get the safe open yet 
it s a little slower than we thought 
but  we re close 
all right  i m just giving it
a wash and wax  so hurry up 
just waiting on you  man 
all set 
son of a bitch 
  hey  dieter  how s that safe coming 
  scheisse 
scott  he s working  man 
you see this  the four locks 
you know what that is 
  no 
  no  of course not 
it s a rotating randomization mechanism 
right  mr  vanderohe 
  affirmative 
  yeah 
you  mr  sausagefinger 
you just made me mess up 
and now we re back to ground zero 
if you mess it up again  it locks forever 
you understand  forever 
okay  how long
will it take you to open it 
okay 
  thirty minutes 
  okay 
thirty minutes of silence 
  you got it 
  silencio 
of silence  okay 
mr  vanderohe 
can you please keep your team quiet 
i need to concentrate  thank you 
thirty minutes  that s not bad  right 
nuclear bomb drops on us
in an hour and 20 minutes 
right  which gives us an hour to get
to the helicopter and get out of here 
  that s plenty of time 
  plenty 
what s the alternative 
run for the edge of the city 
i don t think we ll make it 
no  we don t need an alt  we trust him 
  yeah 
  he can do it 
definitely 
right  van 
yeah  no  no  no  he s got it 
  our guy dieter can do it 
  ah  fuck 
must be the fire egress 
yeah  i got it 
it s probably how the last team got in
and how those shamblers got down here 
hey  what do you think about tofu 
what 
tofu  my next food truck 
i was thinking 
can make anything out of tofu 
tofu burgers  tofu fries 
tofu milkshake  tofu cheesecake 
i don t know what that is 
tofu cheesecake  i don t know 
i thought maybe  since
everyone s going vegan now  you know 
humans are figuring out
they re not at the top of the food chain 
what do you think 
yeah  it s  it s okay 
  yeah 
  keep thinking 
  all good up there 
  uh  yeah  we re secure 
shit 
how much we got in the cart 
i d say 200 grand  easy 
  imagine what s in the safe 
  check this out
