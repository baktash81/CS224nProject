its almost over now

you think the way you lives ok
you think posing will save the day
you think we dont see
that youre running
better call your boys
cos im coming
i dont think your mammyd be
too pleased about that now

who the fuck are you
aidan mcbride sergeant

they told me cappuccino
what the fuck is he doing here
hes the sceneofcrime photographer
are you soft in the head or what
get out mick
or ill tell your mammy about you
i got what i need anyways gerry
its all good clean fun huh
im worried about that young lad
hes an interest in the photographic arts
i can only describe as unhealthy
he looks like brendan foley
i knew his father
he ran off with me second cousin
when i say ran off he was
in a wheelchair the old fella
he was a what er
what do you call it
er paraplegic
spastic yeah
wheeled off
brendan foley ill get onto this
i said he looked like brendan foley
i didnt say he was brendan foley
should you er
should you be removing those
from the bible looks like i knew
thered be a fuckin religious angle
aye he was a goodlooking lad
lovely lips
the significance of the pot plant
has me somewhat perplexed
maybe its genus is a clue
oh genus huh fancy
what the hell are you doing
i have the gift nobody tell you
clairvoyant like
never interfered with a corpse before
no its great gas
i dont think you should
im only messing
lighten up
i dont think it was appropriate
fuck off to america with your
appropriate fuckin barack obama
i was just saying
is there any money in the house
what no
i mean i havent checked
you havent checked
if theres any money
what sort of a fucking guard are you
anyways
five and a half
five and a half
now what the fuck would that mean
theres a film called 8½
fellini
theres another film called se 7 en
are you going to list
a load of film titles with numbers
i can do that
thats your idea of police work
maybe this is the killers
five and a half halfth victim
go on
maybe hes killed four people before
now and hes maimed another lad
cut off his legs maybe
whichd be the half
so thisd be victim number
five and a half
interesting theory
so what youre saying is we may well
have a serial killer on our hands
its a distinct possibility
well thatd be a first for galway
rabbit

those things on the telly
im sorry

its a cruel world
so kenosha wisconsin
you were saying
did you grow up in the projects
what
did you grow up in the projects
or do they not have projects
in kenosha
no i did not grow up in the projects
it might surprise you to learn
sergeant boyle
that i come from
a very privileged background
and by privileged
i mean prep schools yale
i was a rhodes scholar bet you dont
even know what a rhodes scholar is
i do know what a rhodes scholar is
enlighten me
kris kristofferson
yeah kris kristofferson
was a rhodes scholar
you are correct
privileged background huh
summer in the hamptons
skiing in aspen that kind of thing
skiing yeah
i thought black people couldnt ski
or is that swimming
ho ho
so what do you have planned
for your day
well we obviously dont know
who killed mccormick or why
there was no useful forensic
evidence at the crime scene
so i thought we might start
by canvassing the neighbourhood
where the body was discovered
see if anybody heard something
we also must consider the fact
that mccormick was probably
reconnoitring dropoff points
all along the coast
sergeant
what
sorry you lost me at we
we you and i
its my day off did i not tell ya
its your day off
ive had it booked for a good while
you can ask stanton
were investigating a murder
trafficking of half a million dollars
billion
half a billion dollars worth
of cocaine
and youre telling me its your day off
im sure 24 hours
wont make any difference
24 hours wont make any difference
they say it does on these cop shows
but it doesnt not in my experience
ah why do you keep repeating
everything i say
how are you special agent everett
federal bureau of investigation
could i ask you a few questions
oh you dont you dont speak
any english huh
and you dont speak any english
i just wanna show you a few pictures
see if youve seen any of these men
in the last few days this gentleman
im sorry
is there anyone else here that i
so where are you taking us
to have your wicked way
ive a room booked at the g
oh fancy
no expense spared
are we not too official for the g
whether you are or you arent
theyll have sergeant gerry boyle
to deal with if they dont like it
hes power mad
they say power corrupts
and im corrupted absolutely
youll find that out soon enough
are you the fbi man
yes i am
behavioural science unit
er no
actually im investigating
the smuggling of narcotics
ah drugs
hurry up aoife
im tumescent
youre not in bad shape
for an auld lad
so me mothers telling me
sergeant
youre not that old sergeant
dont listen to her
ah im old enough to be your father
you think about that while youre
fucking us if thats what turns you on
oh sinead youre one sick puppy
i think im in love
whats the craic
just a little memento looky
you can put it in your archive
i know what id put in your archive
the mans obsessed
ha wonderbra
now it can be revealed
i have very small breasts
thats ok i have a very small penis
sergeant
how you doing sir
special agent wendell everett of
sir
sir
seen this guy
what about this one
no you dont speak english
either huh
this is the life
are we to assume
youre satisfied with the service
im totally drained sure
ive no jism left
be giving us a good review
at the agency now
oh five stars
only wish id brought me handcuffs
theres always next time
youd be into a bit of bondage
only for you sergeant
only for you
ah for fucks sake
i do not understand
just because his car is here
why does it mean he killed himself
its a suicide hot spot
a lot of the locals have
drowned themselves here
thats why we have to put up
with these prima donnas
i do not think
aidan committed suicide
neither do i to be honest with ye
didnt seem intelligent enough
course if its not suicide
then its foul play
foul play
murder malice aforethought
but i cannot think who would have
wanted to do something bad to aidan
hes a guard
somebody somewhere probably
had a grudge against him
its a better theory than suicide
in my view
is there anything you can tell me
that might have a bearing on all this
anything personal
hes gay
hes gay you know
when one man puts his
im familiar with
the mechanics of it yeah
i just didnt realise
do you think he met someone there
who would do something bad to him
like you know what do you say
like a rent boy or something
yeah a rent boy
no theres not much call for rent boys
around here as far as i know
maybe in town
whyd you marry him
for the visa i suppose
its just between you and me
yes i get a visa and he looks
respectable
yes respectable
wendell
hmm nice outfit
do you juggle as well
fuck you sergeant
hot whiskey johnjoe please
and a cold one while im waiting
yourself
er guinness
two guinnesses as well johnjoe
like the fat man said if you have
to be careful not to drink too much
its because youre not to be trusted
when you do any luck
not a damn thing
man these people out here are
i know its like compton huh
exactly
theyre not too keen on talking
to the law thats for damn sure
most dont even speak english
they speak english well enough
this is a gaelicspeaking region
did they not teach you that at langley
no they did not teach me that
at langley
for the simple fact that langleys
the cia you idiot not the fbi
you didnt know people in the west of
ireland speak gaelic and im the idiot
whatever
how was your day off
energetic
somethings come up
im not talking about my cock
one of my mens gone missing
mcbride
i spotted his car in a known suicide
spot he was on duty at the time
any sign of foul play
not as far as we know
but you dont think its suicide
what then
first mccormick gets murdered
now a guard disappears
its too much of a coincidence
could be he stumbled
onto something and got
whacked
whacked yeah
his first day on the job in connemara
too talk about bad luck
yeah but er where do we start
i say we start with these two lads
and we take it from there
slànte
thats gaelic
whats the first case you ever solved
stealing an ostrich
what
guy stole an ostrich
transported it across state lines
had something to do with the eggs
or something
its more original than dealing crack
anyway you ever have crack
do you think id tell you if i had
ive had it
yet again i dont think you should be
telling me these kinds of things
they say if you have one hit
youre hooked but thats shite
its propaganda for kids
you certainly are an unconventional
police officer sergeant boyle
thank you
that was not meant as a compliment
ah now youre only messing
i know that
whats so fascinating
hmm
i had what i thought was a crank call
saying the person responsible
for mccormicks death
was this lad billy devaney
oh
which ones devaney the italian
yeah
devaneys alibi is that
he was in hanleys on the night
battering joey brennan there
so
so i was thinking
maybe whoever made the crank call
was there on the night saw billy
saw billy devaney assaulting brennan
and decided to throw him in the frame
for mccormick too
exactly
jesus he gave him a hell of a clout
christ hes strong for a little lad
whoa freeze it freeze it
no no go back
fuck
give it
goddamn thats sheehy and cornell
look at it theyre here
like a donkey fucking
a hippopotamus its party time
what
like a donkey fucking
a hippopotamus its party time
what the fuck are you on about
sheehy said
he was taking the piss
for fucks sake
thats nice is that real leather
why what am i fucking cheap
its all there yeah
excuse me
its all there
no its not ive skimmed
a couple of grand off the top
what
course its fucking all there
this is the payoff yeah
we pay you off
you and your pals keep your
fucking noses out of our business
thats the dynamic of this situation
why the fuck would i then cheat you
out your money eh
why would i do that
that doesnt make any sense
thatd defeat the entire purpose
of the fucking interaction fuck me
somebody got out of bed
the wrong side this morning

case what i need from you
what do you need from me wendell

beyond
they didnt hide it very well sloppy
well they were probably out here
after dark
be a lonely old job up here at night
yeah probably ghosts up here
and everything poltergeists

little protestants
killing little protestants
thats funny
i fucking hate bent coppers

its dispiriting though innit
whats the point
its all so fucking meaningless
the money
the money yeah
how much money do you need
to be happy

im at that stage where im looking
for a more meaningful relationship

monogamous
theres one guard
stanton couldnt vouch for
says hes too unpredictable
dont tell me let me guess boyle
yeah thats him
i like sharks
theyre soothing
he was no use
sure what have you got to confess
at your age
whats my age got to do with it

than anything you mightve got up to
shows what you know
really you took part in a sex orgy
or something did ya
one of them bacchanals
get away
or bust a cap in the ass of a homey

if you know whats good for you
and if i dont keep me head down
what then
are we making any headway
sheehy
sergeant boyle
so it was a setup from the start
howd you work that
no it was just a random thing
heard there was a guard in galway
with a penchant for whores
decided to take advantage of it
totally opportunistic on my part
this song really freaks me out man
what did they throw off
the fucking tallahatchie bridge
i always thought it was a baby
yeah
could be a gun
well could be any fuckin thing
bobbie gentry said
she didnt know what it was
supposed to be mysterious like
it gives me the fuckin creeps
you know what gives me the creeps
cunts who beat up women
ah that wasnt me now it was one
of me overenthusiastic minions
cornell or oleary
youre very well informed sergeant
i keep abreast of current events
good man yourself
no im not a fan of violence
against women
and im not a fan of blackmail either
so er as an added incentive
now
whats the point in paying me off
youll have to pay off
every other guard on the west coast
the lot of them
enough as makes no odds
even wendell
whos oh the yank
no i decided that discretion
was the better part of valour there
you know what the americans are like
with their fuckin ideals
ill say this now so as were clear
this is a onetimeonly offer
cross me on this and youre finished
and this is not just about me
you cant just arrest me and its over
there are men behind the men
do you understand
i understand sheehy
i understand
good
goodbye amigos
are you all right
that milkshakes after giving me
a fuckin milkshake headache
oh i hate them
what are you gonna do
ill be alright itll go in a minute
and drop them into the muddy
water off the tallahatchie bridge
you know when you about someone
being liquidated by the mob
hmm
what does that actually mean
means theyve been killed
i mean what else would it mean
i know that but does it mean theyve
actually been turned into liquid
turned into liquid
no just killed
suppose turning someone into liquid
would be too timeconsuming huh
take ages
ah mrs mcbride
youve found him
no im sorry
we just wanted to ask you
a few more questions
please
i thought sergeant boyle was
hes been relieved of those duties
why
there was a jurisdictional issue
hes not right in the head
i dont think we need to involve
mrs mcbride in that discussion do you
right you are
you know more than me
im sorry we were wondering if there
was any reason you could think of
that your husband might have
chosen to disappear
no i told sergeant boyle all i know
no i understand
was he on the take
i i dont understand
mcbride was he taking money
from people gangsters
whoa
he is a good man why would he
no no of course hes a good man
ah sure were all good men
the fact remains
he shows up in the west
at the exact same time
a bunch of drug smugglers
are landing half a billion dollars
worth of cocaine
and then he suddenly goes missing
hmm sounds fishy to me
inspector stanton
youre saying he is a criminal
no were not
many a blind eye be turned
for that money
he is from dublin after all
oh
i thought you wanted to find
my husband but you insult him
mrs mcbride i would like to sincerely
apologise for the insensitivity
i will only speak to sergeant boyle
please do not come to my work again
mrs mc

theres supposed to be
two of those kalashnikovs
and two glocks and a derringer
whats a derringer
its like a baby gun
one of the gay lads used to like
secreting it on his person you know
there were gay lads in the ira
there are one or two like
it was the only way we could
successfully infiltrate the ml5
what
i mean an ak47
a glock and a derringer
thats a lot to go missing like
have you any idea
what happened to them
maybe the mice ate them
huh
maybe the mice ate them
i cant be after putting that in
me report maybe the mice ate them
no
not really no
why dont you put in your report
that sergeant boyle
went out of his fuckin way
to do you boys a fuckin favour
and he got really fuckin annoyed
when you started asking him stupid
questions about missing fuckin guns
and trying to fuckin catch him out
as if he was some fuckin gobshite
no need for that
you have your explosives dont ya
its not as if you lads were ever keen
on getting in close for a scrap now
blowing up australians by mistake
from a distance

i accept your apology colum
you boys owe me one though
for going out of me way

tomorrow night so were good to go
i fuckin hate that
what
americanisms

why the guard i mean
the blackmail didnt bother
him and he didnt take the money
im impressed
i was too i have to say
yeah good luck to him
its not often you come across
that kind of integrity in our business
still
yeah we cant have that
well have to make sure
