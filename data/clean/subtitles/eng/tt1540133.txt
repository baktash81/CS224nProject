  it s almost over now 
it s almost over now
  for you fuckin  posers
  yeah
  it s almost over now 
it s almost over now
  you think the way you live s ok
  you think posing will save the day
  you think we don t see
that you re running
  better call your boys
cos i m coming     
i don t think your mammy d be
too pleased about that now 
what a beautiful fuckin  day 
  who the fuck are you 
  aidan mcbride  sergeant 
  don t know you 
  just transferred from dublin 
big city boy  huh 
and me just a lowly country nobody 
  lonely 
  huh 
  lonely country nobody 
  lowly  lowly 
lowly  i thought you said  lonely  
not too sharp on the uptake  are you 
you ll go far in this outfit 
fuckin  latte s my drink 
they told me cappuccino 
what the fuck is he doing here 
  he s the scene of crime photographer 
  are you soft in the head or what 
get out  mick 
or i ll tell your mammy about you 
i got what i need anyways  gerry 
it s all good clean fun  huh 
i m worried about that young lad 
he s an interest in the photographic arts
i can only describe as unhealthy 
he looks like brendan foley 
i knew his father 
he ran off with me second cousin 
when i say  ran off   he was
in a wheelchair  the old fella 
he was a what  er 
what do you call it 
  er  paraplegic 
  spastic  yeah 
wheeled off 
brendan foley  i ll get onto this 
i said he looked like brendan foley 
i didn t say he was brendan foley 
should you  er 
should you be removing those 
from the bible  looks like  i knew
there d be a fuckin  religious angle 
aye  he was a good looking lad 
lovely lips 
the significance of the pot plant
has me somewhat perplexed 
  maybe its genus is a clue 
  oh  genus  huh  fancy 
  what the hell are you doing 
  i have the gift  nobody tell you 
clairvoyant  like 
never interfered with a corpse before 
no  it s great gas 
  i don t think you should   
  i m only messing 
  lighten up 
  i don t think it was appropriate 
fuck off to america with your
 appropriate  fuckin  barack obama 
i was just saying 
  is there any money in the house 
  what  no 
i mean  i haven t checked 
you haven t checked
if there s any money 
what sort of a fucking guard are you 
anyways 
five and a half   
five and a half 
now what the fuck would that mean 
there s a film called  8½  
fellini 
there s another film called  se 7 en  
are you going to list
a load of film titles with numbers 
i can do that 
that s your idea of police work 
maybe this is the killer s
five and a half    halfth victim 
go on 
maybe he s killed four people before
now  and he s maimed another lad 
cut off his legs maybe 
which d be the half 
so this d be victim number
five and a half 
interesting theory 
so what you re saying is  we may well
have a serial killer on our hands 
it s a distinct possibility 
well  that d be a first for galway 
rabbit 
sergeant gerry boyle  cop shop

he might be on the tear somewhere 
  he does not drink 
  he doesn t drink 
he called me at eight o clock 
he said he was on his way home 
i ve tried his cellphone  but it s dead 
ah  there s been no accidents

i m only after getting in meself 
  would it be to do with your work 
  ah  no 
do you mean  has he gone
undercover with the mob 
ah  no  you d have to head down
to limerick for that sort of excitement 
  how long have you been married 
  three years 
  where are you from  romania 
  croatia 
ah  croatia 
good footballers  the croatians

those things  on the telly 
  i m sorry

the south koreans  lovely food 
bullshit 
no  1500 metres freestyle 
i thought i was odds on
for the bronze 
the two germans i was prepared for 
but fuckin  salnikov 
supposed to be over the hill  russians
never know when they re beaten 
 the monster in the waves  
they called him 
you were fourth in the olympics 
you don t get anything for fourth 
it s a cruel world 
so  kenosha  wisconsin 
you were saying 
did you grow up in the projects 
  what 
  did you grow up in the projects 
or do they not have projects
in kenosha 
no  i did not grow up in the projects 
it might surprise you to learn 
sergeant boyle 
that i come from
a very privileged background 
and by  privileged  
i mean prep schools  yale 
i was a rhodes scholar  bet you don t
even know what a rhodes scholar is 
  i do know what a rhodes scholar is 
  enlighten me 
kris kristofferson 
yeah  kris kristofferson
was a rhodes scholar 
you are correct 
privileged background  huh 
summer in the hamptons 
skiing in aspen  that kind of thing 
skiing  yeah 
i thought black people couldn t ski 
or is that swimming 
ho  ho 
so what do you have planned
for your day 
well  we obviously don t know
who killed mccormick or why 
there was no useful forensic
evidence at the crime scene 
so i thought we might start
by canvassing the neighbourhood
where the body was discovered 
see if anybody heard something 
we also must consider the fact
that mccormick was probably
reconnoitring drop off points
all along the coast 
  sergeant 
  what 
sorry  you lost me at  we  
we  you and i 
it s my day off  did i not tell ya 
it s your day off 
i ve had it booked for a good while 
you can ask stanton 
we re investigating a murder 
trafficking of half a million dollars    
billion 
   half a billion dollars  worth
of cocaine 
and you re telling me it s your day off 
i m sure 24 hours
won t make any difference 
24 hours won t make any difference 
they say it does on these cop shows 
but it doesn t  not in my experience 
ah  why do you keep repeating
everything i say 
how are you  special agent everett 
federal bureau of investigation 
could i ask you a few questions 
oh  you don t    you don t speak
any english  huh 
and you don t speak any english 
i just wanna show you a few pictures 
see if you ve seen any of these men
in the last few days  this gentleman 
i m sorry 
is there anyone else here that i    
so where are you taking us
to have your wicked way 
  i ve a room booked at the g 
  oh  fancy 
  no expense spared 
  are we not too official for the g 
whether you are or you aren t 
they ll have sergeant gerry boyle
to deal with if they don t like it 
  he s power mad 
  they say power corrupts 
and i m corrupted absolutely 
you ll find that out soon enough 
  are you the fbi man 
  yes  i am 
  behavioural science unit 
  er  no 
actually i m investigating
the smuggling of narcotics 
ah  drugs 
hurry up  aoife 
i m tumescent 
you re not in bad shape
for an auld lad 
  so me mother s telling me 
  sergeant 
you re not that old  sergeant 
don t listen to her 
ah  i m old enough to be your father 
you think about that while you re
fucking us  if that s what turns you on 
oh  sinead  you re one sick puppy 
i think i m in love 
what s the craic 
  just a little memento  looky 
  you can put it in your archive 
  i know what i d put in your archive 
  the man s obsessed 
ha  wonderbra 
now it can be revealed 
i have very small breasts 
that s ok  i have a very small penis 
sergeant 
how you doing  sir 
special agent wendell everett of   
sir 
sir 
seen this guy 
what about this one 
no  you don t speak english
either  huh 
this is the life 
are we to assume
you re satisfied with the service 
i m totally drained  sure 
i ve no jism left 
be giving us a good review
at the agency now 
oh  five stars 
  only wish i d brought me handcuffs 
  there s always next time 
  you d be into a bit of bondage 
  only for you  sergeant 
only for you 
ah  for fuck s sake 
i do not understand 
just because his car is here 
why does it mean he killed himself 
it s a suicide hot spot 
a lot of the locals have
drowned themselves here 
that s why we have to put up
with these prima donnas 
i do not think
aidan committed suicide 
neither do i  to be honest with ye 
didn t seem intelligent enough 
course  if it s not suicide 
then it s foul play 
foul play 
murder  malice aforethought 
but i cannot think who would have
wanted to do something bad to aidan 
he s a guard 
somebody somewhere probably
had a grudge against him 
it s a better theory than suicide 
in my view 
is there anything you can tell me
that might have a bearing on all this 
  anything personal 
  he s gay 
he s gay  you know 
when one man puts his   
i m familiar with
the mechanics of it  yeah 
i just didn t realise 
do you think he met someone there
who would do something bad to him 
like  you know  what do you say 
  like a rent boy or something 
  yeah  a rent boy 
no  there s not much call for rent boys
around here  as far as i know 
maybe in town 
why d you marry him 
for the visa  i suppose 
it s just between you and me 
yes  i get a visa and he looks   
  respectable 
  yes  respectable 
wendell 
hmm  nice outfit 
do you juggle as well 
fuck you  sergeant 
hot whiskey  john joe  please 
and a cold one while i m waiting 
  yourself 
  er  guinness 
two guinnesses as well  john joe 
like the fat man said  if you have
to be careful not to drink too much 
it s because you re not to be trusted
when you do  any luck 
not a damn thing 
man  these people out here are   
  i know  it s like compton  huh 
  exactly 
they re not too keen on talking
to the law  that s for damn sure 
  most don t even speak english 
  they speak english well enough 
this is a gaelic speaking region 
did they not teach you that at langley 
no  they did not teach me that
at langley 
for the simple fact that langley s
the cia  you idiot  not the fbi 
you didn t know people in the west of
ireland speak gaelic and i m the idiot 
whatever 
  how was your day off 
  energetic 
something s come up 
i m not talking about my cock 
one of my men s gone missing 
mcbride 
i spotted his car in a known suicide
spot  he was on duty at the time 
  any sign of foul play 
  not as far as we know 
but you don t think it s suicide 
what  then 
first mccormick gets murdered 
now a guard disappears 
it s too much of a coincidence 
could be he stumbled
onto something and got    
  whacked 
  whacked  yeah 
his first day on the job in connemara 
too  talk about bad luck 
yeah  but  er  where do we start 
i say we start with these two lads
and we take it from there 
slànte 
that s gaelic 
what s the first case you ever solved 
  stealing an ostrich 
  what 
guy stole an ostrich 
transported it across state lines 
had something to do with the eggs
or something 
it s more original than dealing crack 
anyway  you ever have crack 
  do you think i d tell you if i had 
  i ve had it 
yet again  i don t think you should be
telling me these kinds of things 
they say if you have one hit
you re hooked  but that s shite 
it s propaganda for kids 
you certainly are an unconventional
police officer  sergeant boyle 
  thank you 
  that was not meant as a compliment 
ah  now  you re only messing 
i know that 
what s so fascinating 
hmm 
i had what i thought was a crank call
saying the person responsible
for mccormick s death
was this lad billy devaney 
oh 
  which one s devaney  the italian 
  yeah 
devaney s alibi is that
he was in hanley s on the night
battering joey brennan there 
  so 
  so i was thinking   
maybe whoever made the crank call
was there on the night  saw billy   
saw billy devaney assaulting brennan
and decided to throw him in the frame
for mccormick too 
exactly 
jesus  he gave him a hell of a clout 
christ  he s strong for a little lad 
whoa  freeze it  freeze it 
  no  no  go back 
  fuck

fucking noses out of our business 
that s the dynamic of this situation 
why the fuck would i then cheat you

that doesn t make any sense 
that d defeat the entire purpose
of the fucking interaction  fuck me 
somebody got out of bed

what do you need from me  wendell 
apart from a cup of fuckin  coffee 
boyle  some mad lad
wants to talk to ya 
his cat s probably stuck up a tree
or something 
you should probably take that 
so  logistically 
what we re gonna need is   
  where is it 
  beyond 
they didn t hide it very well  sloppy 
well  they were probably out here
after dark 
be a lonely old job up here at night 
yeah  probably ghosts up here
and everything  poltergeists 
i don t know about the poltergeists 
there s nothing to peg around 
  what were you doing up here 
  heroin 
you ll get a belt  eugene 
if you carry on with that craic 
give us a hand here 
  what 
  you ve taken something

you re trippin   nigga  if you frisk me 
i ll have you up on charges 
you want me to batter the hell

what in hell are you doing 
  it s tiny 
  it s a derringer 
john wilkes booth used one
to assassinate abraham lincoln 
wouldn t think it d do much damage 
they get the job done  but i can t see
what use they d be to the  ra 
maybe they re for killing
little protestants 
killing little protestants 
that s funny 
i fucking hate bent coppers 
  did they try something 
  no  they didn t try something 
what s the problem  then 
i m fucking tired of the kind
of people we have to deal with 
what d ye expect 
we re drug traffickers 
dalai lama s hardly gonna be
looking for a piece of the action 
it s dispiriting  though  innit 
what s the point 
it s all so fucking meaningless 
  the money 
  the money  yeah 
how much money do you need
to be happy 
  the whores 
  the whores  yeah 
i m at that stage where i m looking
for a more meaningful relationship 
i m with you there 
monogamous 
there s one guard
stanton couldn t vouch for 
says he s too unpredictable 
don t tell me  let me guess  boyle 
yeah  that s him 
i like sharks 
they re soothing 
he was no use 
sure  what have you got to confess 
at your age 
what s my age got to do with it 
sure  pol pot was in his 70s
when he died 
i think pol pot s shenanigans
were a little more malicious
than anything you might ve got up to 
shows what you know 
really  you took part in a sex orgy
or something  did ya 
  one of them bacchanals 
  get away 
or bust a cap in the ass of a homey 
so how are things
in the world of law enforcement 
  we ve had a lad over from the fbi 
  oh  the behavioural science unit 
drugs 
  ah  sure 
  yeah 
  what kind of drugs 
  cocaine 
cocaine 
i could do with some cocaine 
they say it gives you
great get up and go 
oh  it perks you up  all right 
helps you get off with the lasses  too 
they re mad for the stuff 
  who could blame them 
  true enough 
  what about amyl nitrate 
  what 
  what does amyl nitrate do for you 
  am i a fucking drugs aficionado 
what s with the sudden interest 
i don t know 
i    i feel i ve missed out 
  you missed out on amyl nitrate 
  well  generally  i m saying 
ah  sure  we all fucking
missed out generally 
you re not alone there 
what s going on in that tiny little
brain of yours  come on  tell me 
i was just thinking i haven t   
listened to music in a long time 
live music  you know 
like a ceilidh band 
if that s all 
i can sort something out for tonight 
  you will 
  bound to be something good on 
it s not as if
you re that hard to please 
yeah  that s what they said to me
at the orgy 
  you ve been in the wars  huh 
  yeah 
  who did that to ya 
  just a fella 
just a fella  not a very nice fella 
there are no nice fellas 
oh  i wouldn t be too sure
about that  now 
that s a very pessimistic world view 
two more of them  please  yuyang 
chocolate 
what brings you back to galway 
aoife  nothing good  i m betting 
it s about those pictures 
  what pictures 
  the ones from the g 
what about them 
i m to tell you to keep your head down 
if you know what s good for you 
and if i don t keep me head down 
what then 
are we making any headway 
  sheehy 
  sergeant boyle 
so it was a set up from the start 
  how d you work that 
  no  it was just a random thing 
heard there was a guard in galway
with a penchant for whores 
decided to take advantage of it 
totally opportunistic on my part 
this song really freaks me out  man 
what did they throw off
the fucking tallahatchie bridge 
  i always thought it was a baby 
  yeah 
could be a gun 
well  could be any fuckin  thing 
bobbie gentry said
she didn t know what it was 
supposed to be mysterious  like 
it gives me the fuckin  creeps 
you know what gives me the creeps 
cunts who beat up women 
ah  that wasn t me  now  it was one
of me overenthusiastic minions 
  cornell or o leary 
  you re very well informed  sergeant 
  i keep abreast of current events 
  good man yourself 
no  i m not a fan of violence
against women
and i m not a fan of blackmail either 
so  er  as an added incentive   
  now   
  what s the point in paying me off 
you ll have to pay off
every other guard on the west coast 
  the lot of them 
  enough as makes no odds 
  even wendell 
  who s    oh  the yank 
no  i decided that discretion
was the better part of valour there 
you know what the americans are like
with their fuckin  ideals 
i ll say this now  so as we re clear 
this is a one time only offer 
cross me on this and you re finished 
and this is not just about me 
you can t just arrest me and it s over 
there are men behind the men 
do you understand 
i understand  sheehy 
i understand 
good 
goodbye  amigos 
are you all right 
that milkshake s after giving me
a fuckin  milkshake headache 
oh  i hate them 
  what are you gonna do 
  i ll be alright  it ll go in a minute 
  and drop them into the muddy
water off the tallahatchie bridge  
you know when you about someone
being liquidated by the mob 
  hmm 
  what does that actually mean 
means they ve been killed 
i mean  what else would it mean 
i know that  but does it mean they ve
actually been turned into liquid 
turned into liquid 
no  just    killed 
suppose turning someone into liquid
would be too time consuming  huh 
take ages 
ah  mrs mcbride 
  you ve found him 
  no  i m sorry 
we just wanted to ask you
a few more questions 
  please 
  i thought sergeant boyle was   
  he s been relieved of those duties 
  why 
  there was a jurisdictional issue 
  he s not right in the head 
i don t think we need to involve
mrs mcbride in that discussion  do you 
right you are 
you know more than me 
i m sorry  we were wondering if there
was any reason you could think of
that your husband might have
chosen to disappear 
  no  i told sergeant boyle all i know 
  no  i understand 
  was he on the take 
  i    i don t understand   
mcbride  was he taking money
from people  gangsters 
  whoa 
  he is a good man  why would he    
  no  no  of course he s a good man 
  ah  sure  we re all good men 
the fact remains 
he shows up in the west
at the exact same time
a bunch of drug smugglers
are landing half a billion dollars 
worth of cocaine
and then he suddenly goes missing 
  hmm  sounds fishy to me 
  inspector stanton 
  you re saying he is a criminal 
  no  we re not   
many a blind eye be turned
for that money 
  he is from dublin after all 
  oh 
i thought you wanted to find
my husband  but you insult him 
mrs mcbride  i would like to sincerely
apologise for the insensitivity   
i will only speak to sergeant boyle 
please do not come to my work again 
  mrs mc   
  good day to you 
mrs mcbride  if i could   
hmm  touchy  huh 
they re like that  the romanians 
  sergeant 
  colum 
d you want one of these 
  what are they 
  i dunno 
libyan lad gave them to me 
all different colours  look 
i ll pass  colum 
i ll have one of the purple ones 
they make you feel frisky 
right  we ll have a little look see
for ourselves 
  who found  em 
  young lad 
  we won t have any trouble there 
  no  he s a good lad 
he s a bit cracked  anyways  so  like 
even if he did say something   
  is that the lot  yeah 
  yeah  what s the problem 
there s supposed to be
two of those kalashnikovs
and two glocks  and a derringer 
  what s a derringer 
  it s like a baby gun 
one of the gay lads used to like
secreting it on his person  you know 
  there were gay lads in the ira 
  there are one or two  like 
it was the only way we could
successfully infiltrate the ml5 
what 
i mean  an ak 47 
a glock and a derringer 
that s a lot to go missing  like 
have you any idea
what happened to them 
  maybe the mice ate them 
  huh 
maybe the mice ate them 
i can t be after putting that in
me report   maybe the mice ate them  
  no 
  not really  no 
why don t you put in your report
that sergeant boyle
went out of his fuckin  way
to do you boys a fuckin  favour 
and he got really fuckin  annoyed
when you started asking him stupid
questions about missing fuckin  guns 
and trying to fuckin  catch him out
as if he was some fuckin  gobshite 
  no need for that 
  you have your explosives  don t ya 
it s not as if you lads were ever keen
on getting in close for a scrap  now 
blowing up australians by mistake
from a distance
was more your modus operandi 
there s no need for that 
i m after upsetting you 
i apologise 
now can we leave it at that 
i accept your apology  colum 
you boys owe me one  though 
for going out of me way 
i ll have to put it
to the high command 
  is there still a high command 
  there is  yeah 
well  i can t ask fairer than that 
ta 
the boot s at the other end  colum 
jesus 
i m always doing that 
nothing 
tomorrow night  so  we re good to go 
  i fuckin  hate that 
  what 
americanisms 
 good to go  
what about the guard 
i don t know 
that s an anomaly 
is that the right word 
i don t think it is 
why  the guard  i mean 
the blackmail didn t bother
him and he didn t take the money 
  i m impressed 
  i was  too  i have to say 
yeah  good luck to him 
it s not often you come across
that kind of integrity in our business 
  still   
  yeah  we can t have that 
we ll have to make sure
he s out of harm s way 
  why s it always me  though 
  cos you re a psychopath 
i m a sociopath  not a psychopath 
they explained that to me in mountjoy 
  what s the difference 
  dunno  it s a tricky one 
so    what did dr oleyuwo
say to you 
sure  what could he say 
he won t be happy 
me out gallivanting 
i told him i d have him deported
if he made trouble 
oh  you re a terror 
you ok 
thanks for taking me out  gerry 
you re a good boy 
always a good boy 
oh  stop it 
no  you never gave me
a moment s grief 
ah  now stop  now we both know
that s not true 
let s pretend that it is 
lovely music  huh 
we checked the dispensary 
there was nothing missing 
as far as we could tell 
she probably
saved  em up herself 
she was always crafty like that 
she did not leave a note 
she didn t have
to leave a note 
what needed to be said 
she was a proud woman 
she was a brave woman 
she was my mother 
thank you 
i was sorry to hear about your mother 
you know 
i lost my father a few years ago 
didn t really hit me at the time 
it was only later that i   
it s tough  all right

be too expensive 
sit yourself down there now 
thought you lads were
supposed to be down in cork 
it s called misinformation
in the intelligence community 
  disinformation 
  disinformation  then  smartarse

  unlucky for mr mccormick 
better to be safe than sorry 
though  huh

in your line of work 
it s a hard life 
not a lot of people understand 
i m on tablets  like
