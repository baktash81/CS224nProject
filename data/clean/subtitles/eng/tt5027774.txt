that kind of information
chief
do you really wanna fuck
with the ebbing
police department red
do you
i guess

committed here
defamation of character
aint a crime
not if shes simply
asking a question

i didnt
call you an idiot
i asked if you was an idiot
that was a question
he got you there cedric

take you out right here
on main street red
thought you only took out
black dudes dixon
no no stop it
you ever fucking touch me
motherfucker

nobody ever goes
down that road anyways
unless they got lost
or theyre retards
dont be nervous
is the main thing
it will go just fine
dont look into the
camera obviously
lets hold
for this car
in three two one
so mildred hayes why did
you put up these billboards
my daughter angela
was abducted
raped and murdered
seven months ago
along this selfsame
stretch of road
what you watching
momma stupid news
seems to me
the local police department
is too busy
torturing black folks
to be bothered doing anything
about solving actual crime
i thought these billboards
might concentrate
their minds some
fuck
i dont know
what the police are doing
i do know that my
daughters burnt body
is lying six feet underground
theyre eating
krispy kremes
and busting eightyearolds
for skating
around parking lots
and chief willoughby
why single him out
hes the head of them
bucks gotta stop somewhere
and the buck
stops at willoughby
yeah
dead right it does
you all right
there fella
looks like we got a war
on our hands
can we talk
id do anything
to catch the guy
who did it
mrs hayes
but when the dna
dont match
no one whos ever
been arrested
and when the dna dont match
any other crime nationwide
and when there wasnt
a single eyewitness
from the time
shed left your house
to the time we found her
right now there aint
too much more we can do
could pull blood from every
man and boy in this town
over the age of eight
theres civil rights laws
prevents that mrs hayes
what if he was just
passing through town
every man
in the country then
what if he was just passing
through the country
if it was me
id start up a database
every male baby whats
born stick them on it
and as soon as he done
something wrong
crossreference it
make 100 certain
it was a correct match
then kill him
yeah well theres
definitely civil rights laws
prevents that
im doing everything i can
to track him down
i dont think those
billboards is very fair
the time it took you
to get out here
whining like a bitch
willoughby
some other poor girls
probably
being butchered
right now
but im glad you got
your priorities straight
ill say that for you
theres something else
mildred
i got cancer
im dying
i know it
huh
i know it most everybody
in town knows it
and you still put up
those billboards
well they wouldnt be
as effective
after you croak
right
well looky looky
if it aint
the instigator
of this whole goddamn affair
in the first place
i didnt
instigate shit dixon
playing pool
against the town midget
hes right red
you are playing pool
against the town midget

hes observant
i always disliked you

a snotty little child
thats unfortunate i always
thought you was great
even your name red welby
even your name i disliked

goddamn communist

hey mildred
i saw you on tv
the other day
oh yeah

in the things
that you were saying
i didnt think you
came across real good
i thought you came across
as a stupidass
aint it about time
you got home
to your momma dixon
no it aint time
i go home to my momma
i told her i was gonna be out
till 1200 actually
jesus
thats me versus you
mildred uhhuh
hey robbie
i think that midget
wants to get in my pants
father montgomery
mildred im sorry to be
calling on you so late
but uh
i must say robbie has
been the consummate host
despite his having had
as he was just telling me
somewhat of a tricky day
at school
just some of the guys
on the team giving me crap
crap about what
about the billboards
mildred
which is what ive come to
have a word with you about
oh proceed
i know how hard its
been for you mildred
this past year
we all do
and if there is ever
anything that you need
we will be there for you
always
but the town also knows
what kind of a man
william willoughby is
and the town is dead set
against these billboards
of yours
took a poll
did you father
if you hadnt stopped
coming to church
youd have a little bit
more understanding
of the depth
of peoples feelings
more than a dozen people
came to me on sunday
so yes i took a poll
everybody is with you
about angela
nobody is with you
about this
you know what i was
thinking about today
i was thinking
about those street gangs
they have
down in los angeles
those crips
and those bloods
and i was thinking about
that bunch of new laws
they came up with
in the 1980s
i think it was
to combat those street gangs
those crips and those bloods
and if i remember rightly
the gist of what those
new laws were saying was
if you join
one of these gangs
and youre running
with them
and down the block one night
unbeknownst to you
one of your fellow crips
or your fellow bloods
shoot up a place
or stab a guy
well then even though
you may not know
nothing about it
and you were just standing
on a street corner
minding your own business
what these new laws said
was youre still culpable
youre still culpable
by the very act of having
joined those crips
and those bloods
in the first place
which got me thinking
father
that whole
type of situation
is kinda like you
church boys aint it
you got your colors
you got your clubhouse
youre for want
of a better word a gang
and if you were upstairs
smoking a pipe
and reading your bible
while one of your fellow
gang members
is downstairs fucking
an altar boy well
father just like those crips
and just like those bloods
youre culpable
because you joined
the gang man
i dont care
if you never did shit
you never saw shit
you never heard shit
you join the gang
youre culpable
and when a person is culpable
to altarboyfucking
or any kinda boyfucking
because i know you guys didnt
really narrow that down
then you kinda forfeit the
right to come into my house
and say anything about me
or my life or my daughter
or my billboards
so why dont you just finish
up your tea there father
and get the fuck
outta my kitchen
but thanks for coming up
anyway father
how you been
feeling bill
ah like i got cancer
in a major organ
well i just want you to know
were all on your side
about this
mildred hayes thing
if i have to hear that
one more fucking time
im done with this shit
i cant waste my life waiting
stop reading
fucking comic books
and get me the file
on the hayes case
angela hayes case
or the mildred hayes case
there is no
mildred hayes case
weve had
two official complaints
about those billboards
so actually
from who
theres a lady
with a funny eye
and a fat dentist
get me the file
on the angela hayes case

are you talking about
and im trying
to fucking concentrate
fucking midgets
what you looking for
anyway
theres nothing
to look for

can i get a little
novocaine there doc

of minutes

mr willoughby
i think i heard that
in a shakespeare one time
you dummy
its oscar wilde
ah
oscar wilde
my darling anne
theres a longer letter
in the dresser drawer
ive been writing
for the last week or so
that one covers us
and my memories of us
and how much
ive always loved you
this one just covers tonight
and more importantly today
tonight ive gone out
to the horses to end it
i cannot say sorry
for the act itself
although i know
that for a short time
you will be angry at me
or even hate me for it
please dont
this is not a case of
i came in this world alone
and im going
out of it alone
or anything dumb like that
i did not come
in this world alone
my mom was there
and i am not
going out of it alone
because you are there
drunk on the couch
making oscar wilde cock jokes
no this is a case
in some senses of bravery
not the bravery
of facing a bullet down
the next few months of pain
would be far harder
than that small flash
no its the bravery
of weighing up
the next few months
of still being with you
still waking up with you
of playing with the kids
against the next few months
of seeing in your eyes
how much my pain
is killing you
how my weakened body
as it ebbs away
and you tend to it
are your final and lasting
memories of me
i wont have that
your final memories of me
will be us at the riverside
and that dumb fishing game
which i think they cheated at
and me inside of you
and you on top of me
and barely a fleeting thought

reports
sadly have come in overnight
that chief william willoughby
of ebbing missouri
took his own life
early this morning
in the grounds of his home
this report just in
from gabriella forrester
tragedy
came calling today
upon this quiet family home
outside ebbing missouri
belonging to
chief willoughby
his wife anne
their two young daughters
polly and jane
what appears to be a
selfinflicted gunshot wound
brought life to an end
for chief willoughby
a man highlyrespected
in ebbing
for his diligence
and service to the community
what led him to take his life
in the early hours
of this morning
it is too early to speculate
there were rumors of illness
could it simply have been
the pressures of the job
or could it have something
to do with a story
we ran here
just two weeks ago
of these billboards
and the woman
who put them there
mildred hayes

who fucked her
while she was dying
how about that

you owe me seven fucking
dollars for the rabbit

you dont know how
glad i am to see you

that guy was
trying to scare me
i wouldnt have said
you scare easy
i aint the worst
what can i do
for you maam
my husband
left this for you
before he shot himself
in the head last night
im sorry
mrs willoughby
are you
are you really
sure i am
surely this is the perfect ending for you isnt it
proof those billboards
of yours were successful
a dead policeman
its quantifiable now
are you blaming
this on me
no
im not blaming
this on you
i just came
to give you the letter
now my little girls
are out in the car
so id better not
stay and chat
im not quite sure
what were gonna do
for the rest of the day
its hard to know
what to do
the day your husband
kills himself
its hard to know
what to do
dear mildred
dead man willoughby here
firstly i wanted
to apologize for dying
without catching
your daughters killer
its a source
of great pain to me
and it would
break my heart to think
you thought i didnt care
i did
there are just some cases
where you never
catch a break
then five years
down the line
some guy hears
some other guy
bragging about it
in a bar room or a jail cell
and the whole thing
is wrapped up
through sheer stupidity
i hope that might be true
for angela i really do
second i gotta admit
mildred
the billboards were
a great fucking idea
they were like a chess move
and although they had
absolutely nothing
to do with my dying
im sure that
everyone in town
will assume that they did
which is why for
willoughbys countermove
i decided to pay
the next months rent on them
i thought it would be funny
you having to defend them
another whole month
after theyve stuck me
in the ground
the joke is on you
mildred ha ha
and i hope
they do not kill you
so good luck with all that
and good luck
with everything else too
i hope and i pray
that you get him
well you want me to go
down and talk to them
no i dont want you to
go down and talk to them
somebody sending
their goddamn mother
down to talk
to the goddamn police
to say what
to say to give you
your job back
get rid
of that black guy
aint gonna listen
to some guys mother
asking them to get rid
of some black guy
things have moved on
in the south
well it shouldnt have
will they give you some money
for being laid off and all
i dont know what the
compensation scheme is
for when you throw a guy
out of a window ma
guess i should have
looked into that beforehand
let me google that
a couple of grand maybe
you been there three years
not counting the five years
at the academy
six

good morning missouri fucking
wake up broadcast bitch
i see on the tv there

lit outside of town
last night
bunch of fires huh
out at those billboards
back when i was a cop
i would have been
interested in

because technically
thats arson

i dont really
give a goddamn
ill get it
dixon residence

all right
jason willoughby here
im dead now
sorry about that
theres something
i wanted to say to you
that i never really said
when i was alive
i think youve got the makings
of being
a really good cop jason
and you know why
because deep down
youre a decent man
i know you dont think
i think that
but i do dipshit
i do think
youre too angry though
and i know its all
since your dad died
and you had to go
look after your mom
but as long as you hold on
to so much hate
then i dont think
youre ever gonna become
what i know
you wanna become
a detective
because you know what you
need to become a detective
and i know youre gonna wince
when i say this
but what you need to become
a detective is love
fuck em
because through love
comes calm
and through calm
comes thought
and you need thought to detect
stuff sometimes jason
its kinda all you need
you dont even need a gun
and you definitely
dont need hate
hate never solved nothing
but calm did
and thought did
try it try it
just for a change
no one will think
youre gay
and if they do
arrest them for homophobia
wont they be surprised
good luck to you jason
youre a decent man
and yeah youve had
a run of bad luck
but things are gonna change for you
i can feel it
calm
calm
calm

actually
theyre making the checks

gonna be hard to find
why do you think
hes the guy
i heard him
talking about
something he did
to a girl last year
i couldnt hear
all of it but
it sounded a lot like
what happened to angela
and then he beat
the crap out of me
but because of that
i got a bunch of his dna
so i wanted to
let you know sooner
rather than later
i didnt want you
to give up hope
ive been trying
not to
well
all you can do is try
as my momma says
its not so much
about hope as about
well i didnt used to be
very good at english
at school
so it was more
all you can do is try
to not be so crap
at english
because you need english
really if you wanna be a cop
if you wanna be
anything really
unless you live in mexico
or something
who wants that
hey dixon
thank you
you did good jason
you did real good
but he wasnt the guy
what
there was no match
to the dna
no matches to any other
crimes of this nature
to any crimes at all
in fact
and his record is clean
maybe he was
just bragging
he wasnt just bragging
well thats as may be
but at the time
of angelas death
he wasnt even
in the country
where was he
ive seen his records of entry
and exit to the states
and spoken to his co
he wasnt in the country
dixon he aint our guy
no he
might not be our guy
but he still done
something shitty
i know he did
not in missouri
he didnt
where was he
thats
classified information
oh come on man
if the guy
has a commanding officer
and if the guy
got back to the country
nine months ago
and if the country
where he was is classified
which country
do you think he was in
hey you know
ill give you a clue
it was sandy
that doesnt really
narrow it down
all you need
to know is that
he didnt do nothing
to angela hayes
so were gonna
keep looking
all right
i found my badge
after all
hello
