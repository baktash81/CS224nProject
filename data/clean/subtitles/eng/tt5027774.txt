to divulge
that kind of information 
chief 
do you really wanna fuck
with the ebbing
police department  red 
do you 
i guess 
he said what 
to your face 
no crime has been
committed here 
defamation of character
ain t a crime 
not if she s simply
asking a question 
what are you  an idiot 
don t call me
an idiot  dixon 
i didn t
call you an idiot 
i asked if you was an idiot 
that was a question 
he got you there  cedric 
that s it 
don t fly off the handle 
why in the hell

unless they got lost 
or they re retards 
don t be nervous 
is the main thing 
it will go just fine 
don t look into the
camera  obviously 
let s hold
for this car 
in three  two  one 
so  mildred hayes  why did
you put up these billboards 
my daughter  angela 
was abducted 
raped and murdered
seven months ago
along this selfsame
stretch of road 
what you watching 
momma  stupid news 
seems to me
the local police department
is too busy
torturing black folks
to be bothered doing anything
about solving actual crime 
i thought these billboards
might concentrate
their minds some 
fuck 
i don t know
what the police are doing 
i do know that my   
   daughter s burnt body
is lying six feet underground 
they re eating
krispy kremes
and busting eight year olds
for skating
around parking lots 
and chief willoughby 
why single him out 
he s the head of them 
buck s gotta stop somewhere 
and the buck
stops at willoughby 
yeah 
dead right it does 
you all right
there  fella 
looks like we got a war
on our hands 
can we talk 
i d do anything
to catch the guy
who did it 
mrs  hayes 
but when the dna
don t match
no one who s ever
been arrested 
and when the dna don t match
any other crime nationwide 
and when there wasn t
a single eyewitness
from the time
she d left your house
to the time we found her 
right now there ain t
too much more we can do 
could pull blood from every
man and boy in this town
over the age of eight 
there s civil rights laws
prevents that  mrs  hayes 
what if he was just
passing through town 
every man
in the country  then 
what if he was just passing
through the country 
if it was me 
i d start up a database 
every male baby what s
born  stick them on it 
and as soon as he done
something wrong 
cross reference it 
make 100  certain
it was a correct match 
then kill him 
yeah  well  there s
definitely civil rights laws
prevents that 
i m doing everything i can
to track him down 
i don t think those
billboards is very fair 
the time it took you
to get out here
whining like a bitch 
willoughby 
some other poor girl s
probably
being butchered
right now 
but i m glad you got
your priorities straight 
i ll say that for you 
there s something else 
mildred 
i got cancer 
i m dying 
i know it 
huh 
i know it  most everybody
in town knows it 
and you still put up
those billboards 
well  they wouldn t be
as effective
after you croak 
right 
well  looky looky 
if it ain t
the instigator
of this whole goddamn affair
in the first place 
i didn t
instigate shit  dixon 
playing pool
against the town midget 
he s right  red 
you are playing pool
against the town midget 
he s a cop 
he s observant 
i always disliked you 
ever since you was
a snotty little child 
you still look like
a snotty little child 
that s unfortunate  i always
thought you was great 
even your name  red welby 
even your name i disliked 
well  okay 
like you was some kind of
goddamn communist
and proud of it 
no  it s because
i got red hair 
you know what they do
to faggots
down in cuba  welby 
wow  that s left field 
no  what do they do to
faggots down in cuba  dixon 
they kill them 
which  it might surprise you
to learn  i m against 
i m not sure if they do
kill faggots
down in cuba  dixon 
i know cuba s human rights
record s pretty deplorable
when it comes to
homosexuality 
but killing them 
are you sure you ain t
thinking of wyoming 
always gotta be
the smart ass  jesus 
he s quite good 
isn t he 
hey  willoughby s a good man 
hey  look at me  look at me 
i m talking nice
to you now  aren t i 
i m talking nice to you 
he s a good man 
shouldn t have this be the
only thing he thinks about 
last months left to him 
last months what 
oh   
you didn t know 
yeah  pancreatic 
i m up next  you old
ladies quit yakking 
rude 
hey  mildred 
i saw you on tv
the other day 
  oh  yeah 
  yeah  you looked good 
i mean  you know 
you came across really good
in the things
that you were saying 
i didn t think you
came across real good 
i thought you came across
as a stupid ass 
ain t it about time
you got home
to your momma  dixon 
no  it ain t time
i go home to my momma 
i told her i was gonna be out
till 12 00  actually 
jesus 
that s me versus you 
mildred  uh huh 
hey  robbie 
i think that midget
wants to get in my pants 
father montgomery 
mildred  i m sorry to be
calling on you so late 
but  uh   
i must say  robbie has
been the consummate host 
despite his having had 
as he was just telling me
somewhat of a tricky day
at school 
just some of the guys
on the team giving me crap 
crap about what 
about the billboards 
mildred 
which is what i ve come to
have a word with you about 
oh  proceed 
i know how hard it s
been for you  mildred 
this past year 
we all do 
and if there is ever
anything that you need 
we will be there for you 
always 
but the town also knows
what kind of a man
william willoughby is 
and the town is dead set
against these billboards
of yours 
took a poll 
did you  father 
if you hadn t stopped
coming to church 
you d have a little bit
more understanding
of the depth
of people s feelings 
more than a dozen people
came to me on sunday 
so  yes  i took a poll 
everybody is with you
about angela 
nobody is with you
about this 
you know what i was
thinking about today 
i was thinking
about those street gangs
they have
down in los angeles 
those crips
and those bloods 
and i was thinking about
that bunch of new laws
they came up with
in the 1980s 
i think it was 
to combat those street gangs 
those crips and those bloods 
and  if i remember rightly 
the gist of what those
new laws were saying was 
if you join
one of these gangs 
and you re running
with them 
and down the block one night 
unbeknownst to you 
one of your fellow crips 
or your fellow bloods 
shoot up a place 
or stab a guy   
well then  even though
you may not know
nothing about it
and you were just standing
on a street corner
minding your own business 
what these new laws said
was you re still culpable 
you re still culpable
by the very act of having
joined those crips
and those bloods
in the first place 
which got me thinking 
father 
that whole
type of situation
is kinda like you
church boys  ain t it 
you got your colors 
you got your clubhouse 
you re  for want
of a better word  a gang 
and if you were upstairs
smoking a pipe
and reading your bible
while one of your fellow
gang members
is downstairs fucking
an altar boy  well   
father  just like those crips 
and just like those bloods 
you re culpable 
because you joined
the gang  man 
i don t care
if you never did shit 
you never saw shit 
you never heard shit 
you join the gang 
you re culpable 
and when a person is culpable
to altar boy fucking 
or any kinda boy fucking 
because i know you guys didn t
really narrow that down 
then you kinda forfeit the
right to come into my house
and say anything about me
or my life  or my daughter 
or my billboards 
so why don t you just finish
up your tea there  father 
and get the fuck
outta my kitchen 
but thanks for coming up
anyway  father 
how you been
feeling  bill 
ah  like i got cancer
in a major organ 
well  i just want you to know
we re all on your side
about this
mildred hayes thing 
if i have to hear that
one more fucking time   
i m done with this shit 
i can t waste my life waiting 
stop reading
fucking comic books
and get me the file
on the hayes case 
angela hayes case
or the mildred hayes case 
there is no
mildred hayes case 
we ve had
two official complaints
about those billboards 
so  actually   
from who 
there s a lady
with a funny eye
and a fat dentist 
get me the file
on the angela hayes case 
 lady with
a funny fucking eye  
jesus christ 
late night 
no 
lay off that welby guy 
will you 
or you ll do what 
kick your momma s
fucking teeth in 
no  you won t 
who told you i was laying on him anyway 
the midget 
what the fuck
are you talking about 
and i m trying
to fucking concentrate 
fucking midgets 
what you looking for
anyway 
there s nothing
to look for 
i don t know what it is 
it feels like
it s kinda waggling 
well  if it s waggling 
it s gonna have to come out 
ain t you gonna
take a look at it first 
it s gonna have to come out 
can i get a little
novocaine there  doc 
give it a couple
of minutes 
there s a lot
of good friends
of bill willoughby
in this town 
no  ow  stop  no 
god damn it 
then why don t you tell
those good friends
of bill willoughby
to tell him to go do his
fucking job  fat boy 
hey  mildred 
you didn t happen
to pay a visit
to the dentist today 
did you 
  no 
  huh 
i said  no  
so it wasn t you
who drilled a little hole
in one of big fat geoffrey s
big fat thumbnails  no 
  of course not 
  huh 
i said  of course not  
you drilled a hole
in the dentist 
denise  no  i didn t 
i thought it was
kinda funny myself 
but he wants
to press charges 
so we re gonna have to
bring you in  i m afraid 
so how s it all going
in the nigger torturing
business  dixon 
it s persons of color torturing
business  these days 
if you wanna know 
i didn t torture nobody 
what s the matter
with you 
saying that
goddamn stuff on tv 
my momma watches
that station 
she doesn t know
about the torturing 
no  she s against
that kinda thing 
who s against what 
my momma is against
persons of color torturing 
she said
 nigger torturing  
i said   you can t say
 nigger torturing  no more 
 you gotta say
persons of color torturing  
isn t that right  chief 
ain t that right 
i think i ll be able to
take care of mrs  hayes
on my own
from here on  jason 
sure  chief 
i ll be right outside 
don t give me that look 
if you got rid of every cop
with vaguely racist leanings 
you d have three cops left 
and all of them are gonna
hate the fags 
so what are you gonna do 
you know 
i wanna know something 
mildred 
why did you drill a hole
through poor fat
geoffrey s thumbnail 
that did not happen 
his hand slipped 
he drilled a hole
through his own self 
did he say i did it 
i guess it s his word
against mine  then  huh 
kinda like in all those
rape cases you hear about 
except  this time 
the chick ain t losing 
it ain t really about winning
or losing  though 
is it  mildred 
you think i care about
who wins or loses
between the two of youse 
you think
i care about dentists 
i don t care about
dentists 
nobody cares
about dentists 
what i do care about 
or what i m
interested in
is tying you up
in court so long
that your hours
at the gift shop
be so shot to shit
that you ain t gonna
have a penny
to pay for another
month s billboards 
that s what
i m interested in

you had to sell off
your ex husband s
tractor trailer
to even pay for this month s
billboards  that right 
how is old charlie 
by the way 
he still shacked up with
that pretty little intern
works down at the zoo

why don t you  
as much as
a person might have
tried to avoid the details
of what happened
because he didn t think
it would do any good 
and he couldn t
bear it 
it s also good to be informed
in 20 foot high font
the precise details
of her last moments 
that it wasn t enough
that she was raped

that she died  no 
 raped while dying

you lazy bitch 
thank you  poppa 
that was a real nice day 
that was a real nice fuck 
you got a real nice cock 
mr  willoughby 
is that from a play 
 you got a real nice cock 
mr  willoughby  
i think i heard that
in a shakespeare one time 
you dummy 
it s oscar wilde 
ah 
oscar wilde 
my darling anne 
there s a longer letter
in the dresser drawer
i ve been writing
for the last week or so 
that one covers us
and my memories of us
and how much
i ve always loved you 
this one just covers tonight 
and more importantly  today 
tonight i ve gone out
to the horses to end it 
i cannot say sorry
for the act itself 
although i know
that for a short time
you will be angry at me
or even hate me for it 
please don t 
this is not a case of 
 i came in this world alone
 and i m going
out of it alone  
or anything dumb like that 
i did not come
in this world alone 
my mom was there 
and i am not
going out of it alone 
because you are there 
drunk on the couch 
making oscar wilde cock jokes 
no  this is a case 
in some senses  of bravery 
not the bravery
of facing a bullet down 
the next few months of pain
would be far harder
than that small flash 
no  it s the bravery
of weighing up
the next few months
of still being with you 
still waking up with you 
of playing with the kids
against the next few months
of seeing in your eyes
how much my pain
is killing you 
how my weakened body 
as it ebbs away 
and you tend to it 
are your final and lasting
memories of me 
i won t have that 
your final memories of me
will be us at the riverside
and that dumb fishing game 
which i think they cheated at 
and me inside of you
and you on top of me
and barely a fleeting thought
of the darkness yet to come 
that was the best  anne 
a whole day
of not thinking about it 
dwell on this day  baby 
because it was the best day
of my life 
kiss the girls for me 
and know that
i ve always loved you 
and maybe i ll see you again
if there s another place 
and if there ain t  well 
it s been heaven knowing you 
your boy 
bill 
what the hell s
going on around here 
what 
can you stand now 
yeah  i can stand 
i d better
get out there 
say something to them 
you ain t gonna
faint again  are you 
i know
that the best thing 
the only thing to honor
that man s memory right now
is to go to work 
is to be a good cop 
to walk in his shoes
and do what he did
every day of his life 
help people 
what the hell s going on 
where are you going  boy 
you fucking pig 
what the fuck are you 
shut up 
see  red  i got issues
with white folks too 
fuck you looking at 
reports 
sadly  have come in overnight 
that chief william willoughby
of ebbing  missouri
took his own life
early this morning
in the grounds of his home 
this report just in
from gabriella forrester 
tragedy
came calling today
upon this quiet family home
outside ebbing  missouri 
belonging to
chief willoughby 
his wife  anne 
their two young daughters 
polly and jane 
what appears to be a
self inflicted gunshot wound
brought life to an end
for chief willoughby 
a man highly respected
in ebbing
for his diligence
and service to the community 
what led him to take his life
in the early hours
of this morning 
it is too early to speculate 
there were rumors of illness 
could it simply have been
the pressures of the job 
or could it have something
to do with a story
we ran here
just two weeks ago
of these billboards 
and the woman
who put them there 
mildred hayes 
don t  don t 
hi  there 
you know
who threw that can 
what can 
how about you  sweetheart

hard of reading

unfortunate event

fucking kidding me

while i was throwing some guy
out a fucking window 
you know  the usual 
yeah 
they never taught me
that one at the academy 
which fucking academy

how are things coming along

coming along
on the hand me your gun
and your badge 
huh 
hand me your gun
and your badge 
shit 
it s in here somewhere 
hey  listen 
i can t find my badge 
no  seriously 
maybe i lost it 
dropped it when i was
doing that window guy 
just get the fuck out of
my station house  man 
what s going on 
i think i just got fired 
fired or suspended 
i m not sure which 
fired 
anything i can help you with 
just give me a holler 
give mildred hayes
a holler 
okay 
you know me 
only from the tv
and the radio 
how much these here
 welcome to missouri 
rabbits go for 
seven bucks 
it s writ right on them 
guess he ain t
seven bucks now 
what did you
come in here for 
what did i
come in here for 
maybe i m a good friend of
willoughby s  how about that 
are you 
or  you know   
maybe i was a friend of
your daughter or something 
how about that 
were you 
or  um   
you know 
maybe i was the one
who fucked her
while she was dying 
how about that 
were you 
no 
i would have liked to 
i saw her picture
in the paper there 
saved by the bell  huh 
you owe me seven fucking
dollars for the rabbit 
guess you ll have to
get it off me
next time
i m passing through 
guess i will 
you don t know how
glad i am to see you 
what 
that guy was
trying to scare me 
i wouldn t have said
you scare easy 
i ain t the worst 
what can i do
for you  ma am 
my husband
left this for you
before he shot himself
in the head last night 
i m sorry 
mrs  willoughby   
are you 
are you really 
  sure  i am 
  surely this is the perfect ending for you  isn t it 
proof those billboards
of yours were successful 
a dead policeman 
it s quantifiable now 
are you blaming
this on me 
no 
i m not blaming
this on you 
i just came
to give you the letter 
now my little girls
are out in the car 
so i d better not
stay and chat 
i m not quite sure
what we re gonna do
for the rest of the day 
it s hard to know
what to do
the day your husband
kills himself 
it s hard to know
what to do 
dear mildred 
dead man willoughby here 
firstly  i wanted
to apologize for dying
without catching
your daughter s killer 
it s a source
of great pain to me 
and it would
break my heart to think
you thought i didn t care 
i did 
there are just some cases
where you never
catch a break 
then five years
down the line
some guy hears
some other guy
bragging about it
in a bar room or a jail cell
and the whole thing
is wrapped up
through sheer stupidity 
i hope that might be true
for angela  i really do 
second  i gotta admit 
mildred 
the billboards were
a great fucking idea 
they were like a chess move 
and although they had
absolutely nothing
to do with my dying 
i m sure that
everyone in town
will assume that they did 
which is why  for
willoughby s counter move 
i decided to pay
the next month s rent on them 
i thought it would be funny 
you having to defend them
another whole month
after they ve stuck me
in the ground 
the joke is on you 
mildred  ha ha 
and i hope
they do not kill you 
so good luck with all that 
and good luck
with everything else too 
i hope and i pray
that you get him 
well  you want me to go
down and talk to them 
no  i don t want you to
go down and talk to them 
somebody sending
their goddamn mother
down to talk
to the goddamn police 
to say what 
to say to give you
your job back 
get rid
of that black guy 
ain t gonna listen
to some guy s mother
asking them to get rid
of some black guy 
things have moved on
in the south 
well  it shouldn t have 
will they give you some money
for being laid off and all 
i don t know what the
compensation scheme is
for when you throw a guy
out of a window  ma 
guess i should have
looked into that beforehand 
let me google that 
a couple of grand  maybe 
you been there three years 
not counting the five years
at the academy 
six 
if you count the year
you were held back 
where are you going 
none of your business 
off to see your fancy woman 
i don t got a fancy woman 
yeah  i know 
hey  you wanna
watch yourself 
or  or you ll do what 
i ll blow your goddamn
head off  that s what 
oh

ooh  then those motherfuckers
better watch out  all right 
fucking a 
what s this shit 
and as sad as the spectacle
of these burned out
billboards might be 
in light of the death
of chief willoughby 
this reporter for one
wonders if this
finally puts an end
to the strange saga
of the three billboards   
this doesn t put an end
to shit  you fucking retard 
this is just
the fucking start 
why don t you
put that on your
good morning missouri fucking
wake up broadcast  bitch 
i see on the tv there
were a bunch of fires
lit outside of town
last night 
bunch of fires  huh 
out at those billboards 
back when i was a cop
i would have been
interested in
who set those fires 
because  technically 
that s arson 
but as i m no longer
employed by those people 
i don t really
give a goddamn 
i ll get it 
dixon residence 
hey  dixon  it s cedric 
oh  hey  sarge 
you got any news 
  news about what 
  i don t know 
about my job and stuff 
no  no  what 
no 
anne willoughby
just dropped in a letter
that bill wrote you
before he died 
what s it say 
i haven t read it 
it s not my letter 
oh  well  listen 
i ll come right down 
um  i ll be there
in like 15 minutes 
well    uh   
not such a great idea 
things as they stand  jason 
you still got your keys
to the station house 
though  right 
yeah 
why don t you
come and pick it up
after everyone s gone home 
i can leave it
on your desk for you 
oh  okay 
actually  yeah  then
when you re done  you can
just leave the keys 
you know  save us
picking them up later 
all right 
jason  willoughby here 
i m dead now 
sorry about that 
there s something
i wanted to say to you
that i never really said
when i was alive 
i think you ve got the makings
of being
a really good cop  jason 
and you know why 
because deep down
you re a decent man 
i know you don t think
i think that 
but i do  dipshit 
i do think
you re too angry  though 
and i know it s all
since your dad died 
and you had to go
look after your mom 
but as long as you hold on
to so much hate 
then i don t think
you re ever gonna become
what i know
you wanna become 
a detective 
because you know what you
need to become a detective 
and i know you re gonna wince
when i say this   
but what you need to become
a detective is love 
fuck  em 
because through love
comes calm 
and through calm
comes thought 
and you need thought to detect
stuff sometimes  jason 
it s kinda all you need 
you don t even need a gun 
and you definitely
don t need hate 
hate never solved nothing 
but calm did 
and thought did 
try it  try it
just for a change 
no one will think
you re gay 
and if they do 
arrest them for homophobia 
won t they be surprised 
good luck to you  jason 
you re a decent man 
and yeah  you ve had
a run of bad luck 
but things are gonna change for you 
i can feel it 
calm 
calm 
calm

jason  please

please open the door

jason 
i m all right  momma 
it s all gonna be all right 
i don t wanna get your
hopes up  all right 
but there is a guy 
and i think
he might be the guy 
i got his dna 
got a lot of it 
actually 
they re making the checks
as we speak 
he s in jail 
no  but he ain t
gonna be hard to find 
why do you think
he s the guy 
i heard him
talking about
something he did
to a girl last year 
i couldn t hear
all of it  but   
it sounded a lot like
what happened to angela 
and then he beat
the crap out of me 
but because of that 
i got a bunch of his dna 
so  i wanted to
let you know sooner
rather than later 
i didn t want you
to give up hope 
i ve been trying
not to 
well   
all you can do is try 
as my momma says 
it s not so much
about hope as about   
well  i didn t used to be
very good at english
at school 
so it was more
 all you can do is try
 to not be so crap
at english  
because you need english 
really  if you wanna be a cop 
if you wanna be
anything  really 
unless you live in mexico
or something 
who wants that 
hey  dixon 
thank you 
you did good  jason 
you did real good 
but he wasn t the guy 
what 
there was no match
to the dna 
no matches to any other
crimes of this nature 
to any crimes at all 
in fact 
and his record is clean 
maybe he was
just bragging 
he wasn t just bragging 
well  that s as may be 
but at the time
of angela s death 
he wasn t even
in the country 
where was he 
i ve seen his records of entry
and exit to the states 
and spoken to his co 
he wasn t in the country 
dixon  he ain t our guy 
no  he
might not be our guy 
but he still done
something shitty 
i know he did
