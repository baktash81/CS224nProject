my name is turkish
funny name for an englishman i know
my parents were on the same plane
when it crashed thats how they met
they named me after the plane
not many people are
named after a plane crash
thats tommy
he tells people
he was named after a gun
but i know he was really named after
a famous 19th century ballet dancer
known him for as long as i can
remember hes my partner
doesnt mean we hold hands
or take walks
it means i try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me
i give him a hard time
keeps him in check
but really hes like my brother
what do i know about diamonds
im a boxing promoter
i was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago and then
what do i know about diamonds
dont they come from antwerp
himy would you listen to this
do we have a choice
it wasnt meant to be taken literally
its a nice story adam and eve
its bound with moral fibre
but asking a grown man
to believe it
what is it
well what is it
what you want i should do
drop my pants
okay go through
its a nice story
its just that just a story
catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation
enough already ruben say something
listen are you busy
ill tell you the whole story
the septuagint scholars mistranslated
the hebrew word for young woman
into the greek word for virgin
it was an easy mistake to make
because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling
so they came up with a prophecy
behold the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son
you understand it was virgin
that caught peoples attention
its not everyday a virgin conceives
and bears a son
but leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew
and next thing you know you have
the holy catholic church
oy vay what are you saying
im saying just because
its written
doesnt make it so
gives them hope its not important
whether its fact or fiction
people like to believe
i dont want to hear anymore
anyway who is it that were seeing
michael
hello
mutti
rudy rud rud let them in please
rud its okay let them through
michael
mutti
youve kept us waiting for half an hour
are you trying to give me heartburn

when does your plane leave
twenty minutes
give me your gun
when you get to london
if you want a gun
call this number
boris
boris
he can get you anything you need
is he allowed to do that
its an unlicensed boxing match
its not a tickling competition
these lads are out
to hurt each other
whats with those sausages
charlie
two minutes turkish
look at it how am i supposed
to run this thing from that
well need a proper office
i want a new one
youre going to buy it for me
why me
well you know about caravans
hows that
you spent a summer in one
which means you know more than me
and i dont want to have me pants
pulled down over the price
whats wrong with this one
oh nothing tommy
its tiptop
im just not sure about the colour
its all arranged
you just got to pick it up
heres an address
its a campsite
youve got 10 grand and
it would be nice to see change
whats happening with them sausages
five minutes
it was two minutes five minutes ago
they aint pikeys are they
i fucking hate pikeys
youre a sensitive boy tommy
fuck me hold tight
whats that
its me belt
no tommy theres a gun
in your trousers
whats a gun doing in your trousers
its for protection
protection from what
zee germans
whats to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit
where did you get it
boris the blade
you mean boris the sneaky
fucking russian
heavy isnt it
heavy is good
heavy is reliable
if it doesnt work
you can always hit him with it
boris the blade
or boris the bulletdodger
bent as the soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it
apparently its just impossible
to kill the bastard
back to my partner tommy
tommy runs the other business
the slot machines
which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on gorgeous hands
however tommys a little preoccupied
with protection at present
all right ill take it
theres a reason for tommys newfound
enthusiasm for firearms
sooner or later in unlicensed boxing
you have to deal with that reason
brick top
if thats not worth a bet
i dont know what is
he doesnt look bad does he
no he looks great
hell do you proud
you reckon thats what people should
do for me gary do me proud
its what you deserve
pull your tongue out of my arsehole
dogs do that
youre not a dog are you
no no im not
however
you do have all the characteristics
of a dog gary
all except loyalty
its rumoured that his favourite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun
a plastic bag a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs
youre a ruthless little cunt liam
ill give you that
but i got no time for grouses
feed him to the pigs errol
what the fuck are you two looking at
if you got to deal with him just
make sure you dont end up owing him
then youre in his debt
which means youre in his pocket
and once youre in that
you aint ever coming out
i hear hes a good fighter
so ill use him
ill be doing you a favour boy
what he means is
im doing him a favour
because everybody knows nobody takes
a dive in my fights unlike his
here errol i dont think
he likes me
you dont like me do you
dont know what you mean
i do know i cant wait to get
out of here it stinks
my fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out
play your cards right
and ill sort you out
you can sort me out by showing me out
its hard to make a living
in boxing so now and then
you do something
against your principles
basically you have to forget

oh yeah tommy
brick top loves tommy
dont let me down

americans cant know it was russian

youre my brother so think like it
get somebody else to steal that stone

i dont want you getting
my boy into trouble
hes my only boy
and hes a good boy
hes coursing
whats coursing
hare coursing
they set two lurchers
theyre dogs before you ask
on a hare
and the hare has to outrun the dogs
so what if it doesnt
well the big rabbit gets fucked
doesnt it
proper fucked
yeah tommy
before zee germans get there
do you know these tits errol
i know a lot of tits
but i dont know any
as fucking stupid as these two
john
i cant help guv
tyrone
you silly fat bastard
do you want to do it
that depends
on what
on you buying this caravan
not the rouge one the rose
its not the same caravan
not the same fight
its twice the size of the last one
the fight is twice the size
and me ma needs a caravan
i like to look after me ma
its a fair deal take it
youre lucky we arent worm food
after your last performance
buying a tarts mobile palace
is a little fucking rich
i wasnt calling your mum a tart
i just meant
save your breath for cooling
your porridge
right and shes terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue
have i made myself clear
yeah thats perfectly clear mickey
just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague
did you understand a word
of what he said
ill tell you what
fucker
ill bet you for it
youll what
hell bet you for it
what like tommy did last time
do me a favour
ill do you a favour
you have first bet
if i win i get a caravan
and the boys get
a pair of them shoes
if i lose
fuck it ill do the fight
for free
the last thing i really
want to do is bet a pikey
however i dont really
have much of a choice
somehow ive got to get him to fight
but if i lose
well i dont even want
to think about losing
okay i reckon the hare gets fucked
what proper fucked
you got that london
were on
ill fucking tell you
get those off me
ill tell you
who robbed your bookies
periwinkle blue bye boys
whos proper fucked now then
theres something very wrong
with this
it was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him
well why didnt you bust a cap
in his ass then tommy
mind you youd do more damage
if you threw it at him
what you saying i cant shoot
oh no tommy
i wasnt saying you cant shoot
i know you cant shoot
what were saying is that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers
would do more damage
if you fed it to him
you saying the gun dont work
you tried it
whoops
i want to see
that sneaky fucking russian
whys he got a tea cosy on his head
to keep his head warm
what happened to him
he got shot in the face
i thought that was obvious
whatd you do that for
you mistake him for a rabbit
what do you want me to do
sort it out
im not a witch doctor
but you are a bad boy yardie
and bad boy yardies should know how
to get rid of bodies
i create the bodies
i dont erase the bodies
were in governor
goody gumdrops
get us a cup of tea
would you errol
grab hold of his legs
what do you think
im gonna grab him by his ears
hope this is not a bad moment
do you know who i am
i do
good that will save me
some time then
well i dont
youre always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece
apparently the best thing to do
is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together
would someone mind telling me
who are you
when you got your six pieces
you gotta get rid of them
its no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover
then i hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs
you gotta starve the pigs
for a few days
then the choppedup body
will look like curry to a pisshead
you gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out
for the piggies digestion
you could do this afterwards
of course
but you dont want
to sieve through pigshit do you
they will go through bone like butter
you need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting
so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm
they will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds
in about eight minutes
that means that a single pig
can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh
every minute
hence the expression
as greedy as a pig
well thank you for that
thats a great weight off me mind
now if you wouldnt mind telling me
who the fuck you are
apart from someone who feeds people
to pigs of course
do you know what nemesis means
a righteous infliction
of retribution
manifested by an
appropriate agent
personified in this case
by a horrible cunt
me

a piece of the action

some good old pussy
and have brought your
two little faggot balls along

youve got your parties muddled up
theres no pussy here
just a dose thatll make you wish
you were born a woman
like a prick
youre having second thoughts
youre shrinking
and your two little balls
are shrinking with you
the fact that youve got replica
written on the side of your gun
and the fact that
ive got desert eagle 50
written on the side of mine
should precipitate
your balls into shrinking
along with your presence

we get murdered before we leave the
building and we get fed to the pigs

the walls in fucking anxiety
pardon my cynicism
but i dont exactly trust the pikey
dont think i havent thunk
about that one
its his mums funeral tonight
god bless her
you know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake
im not worried about whether mickey
knocks the other man out
im worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round
what if he doesnt make it
to the fourth round
we get murdered before leaving
the building
and i imagine we get fed
to the pigs
so why are you so calm
i said
i heard what you said tommy

mickeys going down in the fourth
terry over there is in charge

if he goes down this time
our lads at the campsite
theyre over there now
i fucking hate pikeys
how long have we gotta stay here
as long as it takes now shut up
fucking hate pikeys
is he fucking stoned
hes like that before a fight
do you know when youre going down
of course he knows
when hes going down
fuckface whos speaking to you
he asked him didnt he
fuckface i like that one errol
ill remember that next time
i climb off your mum
not now
gonna be a tragedy of a fight
be a nice one
hell of a way to be a war
and there none a yours
theres a camp full of pikeys
that might not think youre so funny
not when theyre putting out flames
on their childrens backs
now get up and have a fucking fight
three rounds and youre a vegetable
arent you pikey
im in charge here
no fucking about no eyegouging
do your worst lets get it on
what the fucks going on
you gonna finish him or what
talk about saved by the bell
do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out
do not knock him out mickey
all right lets break it up
what is he fucking deaf
what is he doing
come on and sit
what the fuck are you doing mickey
youre dancing like a fairy
theyll hang us
if they think its rigged
get out there and hurt him
but for fucks sake
do not knock him out
all hes got to do is stay down
now we are fucked
he cant stand up
were out of here
stupid pikey knows brick tops got
keentokill monkeys with shotguns
sitting outside his campsite
once the campsites wiped out
i know its gonna be the same for us
ever cross the road
and look the wrong way
give me that fucking shooter
and hey presto
theres a car nearly on you
so what do you do
something very silly
you freeze and your life
doesnt flash before you
because youre too scared
to think
you just freeze
and pull a stupid face
but the pikey didnt why
because he had plans
on running the car over
it had previously occurred to me
that hed taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly
for every action
there is a reaction
and a pikey reaction
is quite a fucking thing
pete talk to me
if you want your friend to hear you
talk a lot louder than that
give me that fucking shooter
ill give you your shooter you cunt
that is when i thought the pikey
had money riding on himself
thats why the bastard never
goes down when hes supposed to
weve been tucked up
while hes been cleaning up
were worse off now than
when we started
the next day we went
to the campsite
but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night
which was probably a good thing
considering theyd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area
where is he
he aint fucking here
thats for sure
we cant ask a man to fight for us
if we cant find him can we
you wont find a pikey that
doesnt want to be found
he could be in a campsite
in kampufuckingchea by now
bollocks come on
what you doing here
whats it got to do with you
so what you doing here
im taking the dog for a walk
whats the problem
whats in the car
seats and a steering wheel
what do you know about gypsies
i know theyre not to be trusted
all right get your dog on your way
get the dog tommy
the dog
all right boy come on
come on daisy no daisy
he loves that dog
always playing silly games
stop messing about
and get it in the car tommy
good boy good boy
good boy daisy good boy
could you tell me
why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot
hey george
is that a tea cosy on his head
oh you love a dog dont you tommy
tommy persuaded me to keep the dog
i eventually agreed
as long as he took it to a vet
i couldnt stand
that squeaking anymore
the vet found half an undigested
shoe a squeaky toy
and an 84carat diamond
lodged in its stomach
its quite amazing what can happen
in a week
still didnt shut it up though
so what do you do
you go see the man that knows
about these sort of things
so what do you think
