my name is turkish 
funny name for an englishman  i know 
my parents were on the same plane
when it crashed  that s how they met 
they named me after the plane 
not many people are
named after a plane crash 
that s tommy 
he tells people
he was named after a gun 
but i know he was really named after
a famous 19th century ballet dancer 
known him for as long as i can
remember  he s my partner 
doesn t mean we hold hands
or take walks 
it means i try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me 
i give him a hard time 
keeps him in check 
but really  he s like my brother 
what do i know about diamonds 
i m a boxing promoter 
i was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago  and then 
what do i know about diamonds 
don t they come from antwerp 
  himy  would you listen to this 
  do we have a choice 
it wasn t meant to be taken literally 
it s a nice story  adam and eve 
it s bound with moral fibre   
    but asking a grown man
to believe it 
what is it 
well  what is it 
what you want i should do 
drop my pants 
okay  go through 
it s a nice story 
it s just that  just a story 
catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation 
enough already  ruben  say something 
listen  are you busy 
i ll tell you the whole story 
the septuagint scholars mistranslated
the hebrew word for  young woman    
    into the greek word for  virgin  
it was an easy mistake to make   
    because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling 
so  they came up with a prophecy 
 behold  the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son  
you understand  it was  virgin 
that caught people s attention 
it s not everyday a virgin conceives
and bears a son 
but leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew   
    and next thing you know you have
the holy catholic church 
oy vay   what are you saying  
i m saying  just because
it s written   
    doesn t make it so 
gives them hope  it s not important
whether it s fact or fiction 
  people like to believe 
  i don t want to hear anymore 
anyway  who is it that we re seeing 
  michael 
  hello 
mutti 
rudy  rud  rud  let them in  please 
rud  it s okay  let them through 
  michael 
  mutti 
you ve kept us waiting for half an hour 
are you trying to give me heartburn 
lie down on the floor 
get on the floor 
lie on the floor 
get on the fucking floor 
  get down 
  get fucking down 
down on the floor  get down 
on the ground 
get down  i say 
  time 
  seven minutes 
where is the stone 
where is the stone 
where is the stone 
michael  where is the stone 
when does your plane leave 
twenty minutes 
give me your gun 
when you get to london   
   if you want a gun   
   call this number 
  boris 
  boris 
he can get you anything you need 
is he allowed to do that 
it s an unlicensed boxing match 
it s not a tickling competition 
these lads are out
to hurt each other 
what s with those sausages 
charlie 
two minutes  turkish 
look at it  how am i supposed
to run this thing from that 
we ll need a proper office 
i want a new one 
you re going to buy it for me 
why me 
well  you know about caravans 
how s that 
you spent a summer in one 
which means you know more than me 
and i don t want to have me pants
pulled down over the price 
what s wrong with this one 
oh  nothing  tommy 
it s tiptop 
i m just not sure about the colour 
it s all arranged 
you just got to pick it up 
here s an address 
it s a campsite 
you ve got 10 grand  and
it would be nice to see change 
  what s happening with them sausages 
  five minutes 
it was two minutes five minutes ago 
they ain t pikeys  are they 
i fucking hate pikeys 
you re a sensitive boy  tommy 
fuck me  hold tight 
  what s that 
  it s me belt 
no  tommy  there s a gun
in your trousers 
  what s a gun doing in your trousers 
  it s for protection 
protection from what 
 zee  germans 
what s to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit 
  where did you get it 
  boris the blade 
you mean boris the sneaky 
fucking russian 
heavy  isn t it 
heavy is good 
heavy is reliable 
if it doesn t work 
you can always hit him with it 
boris the blade 
or boris the bullet dodger 
bent as the soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it 
apparently  it s just impossible
to kill the bastard 
back to my partner  tommy 
tommy runs the other business   
    the slot machines   
    which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on gorgeous  hands 
however  tommy s a little preoccupied
with protection at present 
all right  i ll take it 
there s a reason for tommy s newfound
enthusiasm for firearms 
sooner or later  in unlicensed boxing 
you have to deal with that reason 
brick top 
if that s not worth a bet 
i don t know what is 
  he doesn t look bad  does he 
  no  he looks great 
he ll do you proud 
you reckon that s what people should
do for me  gary  do me proud 
it s what you deserve 
pull your tongue out of my arsehole 
dogs do that 
you re not a dog  are you 
no  no  i m not 
however   
   you do have all the characteristics
of a dog  gary 
all except loyalty 
it s rumoured that his favourite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun   
    a plastic bag  a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs 
you re a ruthless little cunt  liam 
i ll give you that 
but i got no time for grouses 
feed him to the pigs  errol 
what the fuck are you two looking at 
if you got to deal with him  just
make sure you don t end up owing him 
then you re in his debt 
which means  you re in his pocket 
and once you re in that 
you ain t ever coming out 
i hear he s a good fighter 
so i ll use him 
i ll be doing you a favour  boy 
what he means is 
i m doing him a favour 
because everybody knows nobody takes
a dive in my fights  unlike his 
here  errol  i don t think
he likes me 
you don t like me  do you 
don t know what you mean 
i do know i can t wait to get
out of here  it stinks 
my fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out 
play your cards right
and i ll sort you out 
you can sort me out by showing me out 
it s hard to make a living
in boxing  so now and then   
    you do something
against your principles 
basically  you have to forget
you got any 
are they lancashire pigs 
who s talking to you 
oh  yeah  tommy 
brick top loves tommy 
don t let me down 
you don t want to let me down  do you 
see you ringside 
boris  franky fucking four fingers   
   has a diamond the size of a fist 
i have told you it s in the briefcase
connected to his arm 
i sent him to you to buy a gun 
what more do you want me to do 
hit him for you 
but don t you hit him either 
americans can t know it was russian 
it will come back to me 
you re my brother  so think like it 
get somebody else to steal that stone 
i don t want it getting back to me 
and don t have him killed 
it will raise suspicion 
so don t use idiots for the job 
he ll stay in london a couple of
days before he goes to new york   
   so move quick  okay 
one more thing 
it might help 
he loves to gamble

  dags

  yeah  dags 
  dags  you like dags 
oh  dogs 
sure  i like dags 
  i like caravans more 
  you re very welcome 
pikeys are well known for their
skills of negotiation in business 
it s probably why
they talk like that   
    so you can t follow
what s being said 
but if tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked   
    on his return
there will be ice cream 
good dog  good family 
he ll get a little homesick 
but he ll get over it 
see you later  lads  see you  boss 
all right  mickey  laters

they aren t bad fellas 
the deal was  you bought it

nobody brings you   
   unless they re trying
to say something without talking 
just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan 
why do i want a caravan

it turned out that the sweet talking 
tattoo sporting pikey

boxing champion 
which makes him harder
than a coffin nail 
right now that s the last thing
on tommy s mind 
if gorgeous doesn t wake up
in the next few minutes   
    tommy knows he ll be buried
with him 
why would the gypsies
want to explain   
    why a man died in their campsite 
not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp 
it s not like they got
social security numbers  is it 
tommy   the tit

i know he s looking for us 
but i don t have a choice 
i m happy to leave the country

i don t want you getting
my boy into trouble 
he s my only boy 
and he s a good boy 
he s coursing 
what s coursing 
hare coursing 
they set two lurchers   
they re dogs  before you ask 
on a hare 
and the hare has to outrun the dogs 
so  what if it doesn t 
well  the big rabbit gets fucked 
doesn t it 
proper fucked 
yeah  tommy 
before  zee  germans get there 
do you know these tits  errol 
i know a lot of tits   
   but i don t know any
as fucking stupid as these two 
john 
i can t help  guv 
tyrone 
you silly  fat bastard 
  do you want to do it 
  that depends 
on what 
on you buying this caravan 
not the rouge one  the rose 
  it s not the same caravan 
  not the same fight 
it s twice the size of the last one 
the fight is twice the size 
and me ma needs a caravan 
i like to look after me ma 
it s a fair deal  take it 
you re lucky we aren t worm food
after your last performance 
buying a tart s mobile palace
is a little fucking rich 
i wasn t calling your mum a tart 
i just meant   
save your breath for cooling
your porridge 
right  and she s terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue 
have i made myself clear 
yeah  that s perfectly clear  mickey 
just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague 
did you understand a word
of what he said 
i ll tell you what 
fucker 
i ll bet you for it 
you ll what 
he ll bet you for it 
what  like tommy did last time 
do me a favour 
i ll do you a favour 
you have first bet 
if i win  i get a caravan   
   and the boys get
a pair of them shoes 
if i lose   
   fuck it  i ll do the fight
for free 
the last thing i really
want to do is bet a pikey 
however  i don t really
have much of a choice 
somehow i ve got to get him to fight 
but if i lose   
well  i don t even want
to think about losing 
okay  i reckon the hare gets fucked 
what  proper fucked 
you got that  london 
we re on 
i ll fucking tell you 
get those off me 
i ll tell you
who robbed your bookies 
periwinkle blue  bye  boys 
who s proper fucked now  then 
there s something very wrong
with this 
it was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him 
well  why didn t you  bust a cap
in his ass  then  tommy 
mind you  you d do more damage
if you threw it at him 
what  you saying i can t shoot 
oh  no  tommy 
i wasn t saying you can t shoot 
i know you can t shoot 
what we re saying is  that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers   
   would do more damage
if you fed it to him 
you saying the gun don t work 
you tried it 
whoops 
i want to see
that sneaky fucking russian 
why s he got a tea cosy on his head 
to keep his head warm 
  what happened to him 
  he got shot in the face 
i thought that was obvious 
what d you do that for 
you mistake him for a rabbit 
  what do you want me to do 
  sort it out 
  i m not a witch doctor 
  but you are a bad boy yardie   
   and bad boy yardies should know how
to get rid of bodies 
i create the bodies 
i don t erase the bodies 
we re in  governor 
goody gumdrops 
get us a cup of tea 
would you  errol 
grab hold of his legs 
what do you think
i m gonna grab him by  his ears 
hope this is not a bad moment 
do you know who i am 
i do 
good  that will save me
some time  then 
well  i don t 
you re always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece 
apparently  the best thing to do   
   is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together 
would someone mind telling me 
who are you 
when you got your six pieces 
you gotta get rid of them 
it s no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover 
then i hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs 
you gotta starve the pigs
for a few days   
   then the chopped up body
will look like curry to a pisshead 
you gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out   
   for the piggies  digestion 
you could do this afterwards 
of course   
   but you don t want
to sieve through pigshit  do you 
they will go through bone like butter 
you need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting   
   so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm 
they will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds   
   in about eight minutes 
that means that a single pig   
   can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh   
   every minute 
hence the expression   
    as greedy as a pig  
well  thank you for that 
that s a great weight off me mind 
now  if you wouldn t mind telling me
who the fuck you are   
   apart from someone who feeds people
to pigs  of course 
do you know what  nemesis  means 
 a righteous infliction
of retribution   
   manifested by an
appropriate agent  
personified  in this case 
by a horrible cunt 
me 
gentlemen   
why can t you find me franky  doug 
avi  what do you want me to do 
i m not a bounty hunter 
what about tony 
bullet tooth tony 
who s bullet tooth   
  tony 
  you silly fuck 
he s a liability 
he d find moses and the burning bush 
you are gonna die  tony 
he got shot six times 
had the bullets moulded into gold 
i shoot you  you go down 
he has two in his teeth
that dad did  so he loves dad 
why don t you fucking die 
  he s the best chance you got 
  six times 
in one sitting 
you re in trouble now 
sounds promising 
what are we waiting for 
bonjour 
what s so fucking important 
why do you think
we ve got a dead man   
   missing an arm in our office 
  talk to me  tell me 
you give us four days   
   i ll get you a stone the size
of a fucking home  i kid you not 
what do you think  errol 
i think we should drip dry them 
while we got the chance 
it was a rhetorical question  errol 
what have i told you about thinking 
  you got 48 hours 
  yeah 
you can keep that silly  fat wanker 
the lads can t lift him 
forty eight hours 
after that it s your family   
   and the pigs finish
what the dogs don t do 
so  what should i call you 
should i call you  bullet    tooth  
call me  susan 
if it makes you happy 
tony  there is a man
i d like you to find 
that depends on all the elements
in the equation  how many are there

i don t care if
he s got fucking hazelnuts 
i want a gun that works 
and i m gonna tell him 
my god  tommy  you certainly

a bullet in your face   
   but unless you give me what
i want there will be fucking murders

let go of the gun 
so  you re obviously the big dick   
   and that  on either side of you 
are your balls 
there are two types of balls 
there are big brave balls 
and there are little faggot balls 
these are your last words
so make them a prayer 
dicks have drive
and clarity of vision   
   but they re not clever 
they smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action 
and you thought you smelled
some good old pussy   
   and have brought your
two little faggot balls along   
   for a good old time  but
you ve got your parties muddled up 
there s no pussy here   
   just a dose that ll make you wish
you were born a woman 
like a prick   
   you re having second thoughts 
you re shrinking 
and your two little balls
are shrinking with you 
the fact that you ve got  replica 
written on the side of your gun   
   and the fact that
i ve got  desert eagle  50    
   written on the side of mine   
   should precipitate   
   your balls into shrinking 
along with your presence 
now   
   fuck off 
lock the door 
lock it 
give me the case 
fuck you 
shoot me 
i will  i ll shoot you 
pass me case or i shoot you

in case we got mugged 
you ain t from this planet  are you 
who is gonna mug two black fellas
holding pistols   
   sat in a car that s worth less
than your shirt 
bullet tooth tony and his friend 
desert eagle 50 
what have they got to do
with anything 
they re both staring straight at me 
you should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity 
now  out of the car 
and leave your water pistols behind 
look  just tell him the stone s back
at the office 
i ll think of something 
why s he sweating 
oh  never mind 
tommy  why is your skin leaking 
  i m a little worried  actually 
  worried about what 
what happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out 
i mean  he s done it before 
hasn t he 
we get murdered before we leave the
building  and we get fed to the pigs 
i m glad to see you re climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety 
pardon my cynicism 
but i don t exactly trust the pikey 
don t think i haven t thunk
about that one 
it s his mum s funeral tonight 
god bless her 
you know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake 
i m not worried about whether mickey
knocks the other man out 
i m worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round 
what if he doesn t make it
to the fourth round 
we get murdered before leaving
the building   
   and i imagine we get fed
to the pigs 
so why are you so calm 
  i said   
  i heard what you said  tommy

to think 
you just freeze
and pull a stupid face 
but the pikey didn t  why 
because he had plans
on running the car over 
it had previously occurred to me   
    that he d taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly 
for every action 
there is a reaction 
and a pikey reaction   
    is quite a fucking thing 
pete  talk to me 
if you want your friend to hear you 
talk a lot louder than that 
  give me that fucking shooter 
  i ll give you your shooter  you cunt 
that is when i thought the pikey
had money riding on himself 
that s why the bastard never
goes down when he s supposed to 
we ve been tucked up   
    while he s been cleaning up 
we re worse off now than
when we started 
the next day we went
to the campsite   
    but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night 
which was probably a good thing   
    considering they d just buried
12 people somewhere in the area 
where is he 
he ain t fucking here 
that s for sure 
we can t ask a man to fight for us
if we can t find him  can we 
you won t find a pikey that
doesn t want to be found 
he could be in a campsite
in kampu fucking chea by now 
bollocks  come on 
  what you doing here 
  what s it got to do with you 
so  what you doing here 
i m taking the dog for a walk 
what s the problem 
what s in the car 
seats and a steering wheel 
what do you know about gypsies 
i know they re not to be trusted 
all right  get your dog  on your way 
get the dog  tommy 
the dog 
all right  boy  come on 
come on  daisy  no  daisy 
he loves that dog 
always playing silly games 
stop messing about
and get it in the car  tommy 
good boy  good boy 
good boy  daisy  good boy 
could you tell me   
   why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot 
hey  george   
   is that a tea cosy on his head 
oh  you love a dog  don t you  tommy 
tommy persuaded me to keep the dog 
i eventually agreed 
as long as he took it to a vet 
i couldn t stand
that squeaking anymore 
the vet found half an undigested
shoe  a squeaky toy   
    and an 84 carat diamond
lodged in its stomach 
it s quite amazing what can happen
in a week 
still didn t shut it up  though 
so  what do you do 
you go see the man that knows
about these sort of things 
so  what do you think
