tomorrow morning   
and  hypothetically  find some
fresh shit on your face 
your cheek  maybe
a little bit in the beard 
what the hell 
i m about to be fucking sick 
what do you do 
do you go to a bathroom
and tear off
a piece of dry tissue   
and rub it around
on your beard a little bit
and then go on 
get on with your day 
go to church 
maybe dinner and a movie 
like nothing happened 
where is this
coming from  man 
but something did happen 
your face smells like shit 
right 
so what you would do 
is you would get some soap 
you d get some hot water   
and you would scrub
the fucking shit
out of your beard
for 10 straight minutes 
you could not
scrub it enough 
are you trying
to make me feel disgusting 
i m starting to feel   
toilet paper is
a pretty fine appetizer 
but  then   
huggies natural care
wet wipes 
that s your main course 
they re soft  they re moist 
they re for babies 
finally  one more pass
with toilet paper 
maybe clear out
that excess moisture 
maybe treat yourself
to a blow and go 
if you can get you
a hair dryer 
just about 30 seconds
would do you good

toddler style 
oh  yeah 
full winnie the pooh 
the hell s happening 
describe it 
i wouldn t ask him to do that 
if i were you 
weasel  it s like  um    here we go 
it s like he was
giving birth anally 
but they quit halfway through 
they got the legs out 
and they said 
 you know what  i m done  
happy 
it s like he s a muppet
from the waist down 
but this time  you can see
the muppet s dick   door opens 
grover s got a cock

dopinder  mr  weasel  i can

jesus christ  looks like an avocado 
domino  your legs  though 
they re cute 
you wanna borrow
a pair of pants 
i m glad everybody dropped by 
you must be wondering
why i didn t call you here 
i ll tell you why i m here 
 the time traveler s wife s 
husband   
beat me within
an inch of my life 
he was torturing me 
but all i told him was
everything he wanted to know 
so  i m here
to help us gear up 
so we can go after him
without me 
wade  no 
i m doing this alone 
the juggernaut
will kill you all  fair enough 
wade  i just need a couple of
hours to get some legs
under me  what will you do 
wade  i don t care
what the kid did to me 
i ain t letting cable
get to him 
even if i have to
teabag him to death 
it s really just a sip of tea
at this point 
zip it  black black widow 
i m flowing 
the first order
of business is
to get me in front of cable   
so i can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body   
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry 
then 
i m gonna take his skin   
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum 
he s standing right
behind you  isn t he 
 cocks gun 
what in the ass 
is this apartment listed
on tinder  grindr 
you picked the wrong shithole
to fuck  future boy 
ugh  is that really necessary 
no  it s his
 basic instinct  
what can we help you with 
i m here to proposition you 
 laughs  oh  boy 
he s really teeing it up 
isn t he 
who gets to make
the first joke 
i think we should all do it
at the same time 
good call 
for  45  you get sucky suck 
both  i only do over

the proposition
has a wonderful
guy pearce performance 
wade  wait  wait  wait 
i wanna do mine over 
give us the line again  i need your help 
trust me  i m even less happy
about this than you are   
but you unleashed
the juggernaut  you dumb cunt 
i can t bring him down alone 
so here we are 
we re no longer
accepting applications
for x force  unfortunately 
even if we were   
there s a wind advisory
in effect until at least   
we don t have a lot of time 
your friend s about
to make his first kill 
no offense 
but if you know so much   
why not travel back to when
he was a baby  kill him then 
or better yet  head back
a little further 
kill baby hitler 
i use a device
to slide through time 
the longer i travel 
the harder it is to control 
i got two charges   c  one to get me here 
one to get me home 
well 
that s just lazy writing 
your boy s
gonna kill the headmaster
of the orphanage tonight 
after that 
he gets a real taste for it 
like 10 year old
kirsten dunst  motherfucker 
so he keeps killing   
and killing  and killing 
and killing   guns cocking 
until one day  he kills
the wrong fucking people 
my people 
relax 
i m retrieving something
from my utility bag 
it s a goddamn fanny pack   
and you know it 
you sick son of a bitch 
the difference
is night and day 
you remind me of my wife 
i m sorry 
i said   you remind me
of my wife  
no  i m sorry
that you said that   
while making heavy eye contact
and applying lip balm 
cable  she always struggled 
but she was funny   
and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor 
something i could
never master 
it was my fault she died 
it was my job
to stop people like him 
i came close a few times   tomorrowplaying 
he wasn t too happy
about that 
he was trying to hurt me   
and he knew exactly
how to do it 
older russell  blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand 
cable  he came into my home   
and took the only thing
that made it a home 
sound familiar 
i m sorry uh huh 
no  i m really sorry 
but that isn t russell 
it doesn t have to be him 
if you knew what i knew   
yeah  he s got anger issues   
maybe a small
learning disability   
splash of diabetes   
but nothing
that can t be fixed 
if you could go back   
and stop the people that took
your girl  would you 
no 
i d buy them all
a bouquet of hand jobs 
of course i fucking would 
but i wouldn t kill a kid 
i m not asking you
to kill a kid 
i ll kill the kid 
i m asking you to save
hundreds of other kids 
russell s gonna burn down
that orphanage 
and i can imagine
your dead girlfriend   
would want you to do
the right thing  wouldn t she 
so  what s it gonna be 
handsome 
give me a chance to save him 
what  you said   
once he kills someone 
he gets a taste for it 
if we can get to him
before that happens   
promise you ll give me
a chance
to put him
on a different path 
define  chance  
i don t know 
how long does it take
to save someone s soul 
that s not   
i ll give you 30 seconds 
what  no  best i can do 
take it or leave it 
 cable groans weasel  he s doing it 
look at the little fella

let alone two women 
god  you re a douche 
bye  wade  bye  yukio 
 we belongplaying 
deadpool  what do you get
when you take
eight feet of chrome   
one pinch of courage   
a cup of good luck   
a dab of racism   
a splash of diabetes   
and a wheelbarrow
full of stage four cancer 
answer  a family 
see  i didn t lie
what kind of film this was 
if there s anything
you take away today   
other than the need to google 
 what the fuck is dubstep     
it s that we all need
to belong to someone 
how something
so small generates
enough energy
to reverse time is   
oh  just fix it  eleven 
or i ll take it
to the genius bar 
cable s gonna kill you
when he finds out 
never heard of him
