grunts
inaudible

man imma tell you
what the big lie is
escapeplaying on radio toilet paper
whats so bad
about toilet paper
gets the job done
does it really
get the job done
all right say you wake up
tomorrow morning
and hypothetically find some
fresh shit on your face
your cheek maybe
a little bit in the beard
what the hell
im about to be fucking sick
what do you do
do you go to a bathroom
and tear off
a piece of dry tissue
and rub it around
on your beard a little bit
and then go on
get on with your day
go to church
maybe dinner and a movie
like nothing happened
where is this
coming from man
but something did happen
your face smells like shit
right
so what you would do
is you would get some soap
youd get some hot water
and you would scrub
the fucking shit
out of your beard
for 10 straight minutes
you could not
scrub it enough
are you trying
to make me feel disgusting
im starting to feel
toilet paper is
a pretty fine appetizer
but then
huggies natural care
wet wipes
thats your main course
theyre soft theyre moist
theyre for babies
finally one more pass
with toilet paper
maybe clear out
that excess moisture
maybe treat yourself
to a blow and go
if you can get you
a hair dryer
just about 30 seconds
would do you good

you must be wondering
why i didnt call you here
ill tell you why im here
the time travelers wifes
husband
beat me within
an inch of my life
he was torturing me
but all i told him was
everything he wanted to know
so im here
to help us gear up
so we can go after him
without me
wade no
im doing this alone
the juggernaut
will kill you all fair enough
wade i just need a couple of
hours to get some legs
under me what will you do
wade i dont care
what the kid did to me
i aint letting cable
get to him
even if i have to
teabag him to death
its really just a sip of tea
at this point
zip it black black widow
im flowing
the first order
of business is
to get me in front of cable
so i can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry
then
im gonna take his skin
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum
hes standing right
behind you isnt he
cocks gun
what in the ass
is this apartment listed
on tinder grindr
you picked the wrong shithole
to fuck future boy
ugh is that really necessary
no its his
basic instinct
what can we help you with
im here to proposition you
laughs oh boy
hes really teeing it up
isnt he
who gets to make
the first joke
i think we should all do it
at the same time
good call
for 45 you get suckysuck

the proposition
has a wonderful
guy pearce performance
wade wait wait wait
i wanna do mine over
give us the line again i need your help
trust me im even less happy
about this than you are
but you unleashed
the juggernaut you dumb cunt
i cant bring him down alone
so here we are
were no longer
accepting applications
for xforce unfortunately
even if we were
theres a wind advisory
in effect until at least
we dont have a lot of time
your friends about
to make his first kill
no offense
but if you know so much
why not travel back to when
he was a baby kill him then
or better yet head back
a little further
kill baby hitler
i use a device
to slide through time
the longer i travel
the harder it is to control
i got two chargesc one to get me here
one to get me home
well
thats just lazy writing
your boys
gonna kill the headmaster
of the orphanage tonight
after that
he gets a real taste for it
like 10yearold
kirsten dunst motherfucker
so he keeps killing
and killing and killing
and killing guns cocking
until one day he kills
the wrong fucking people
my people
relax
im retrieving something
from my utility bag
its a goddamn fanny pack
and you know it
you sick son of a bitch
the difference
is night and day
you remind me of my wife
im sorry
i said you remind me
of my wife
no im sorry
that you said that
while making heavy eye contact
and applying lip balm
cable she always struggled
but she was funny
and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor
something i could
never master
it was my fault she died
it was my job
to stop people like him
i came close a few times tomorrowplaying
he wasnt too happy
about that
he was trying to hurt me
and he knew exactly
how to do it
older russell blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand
cable he came into my home
and took the only thing
that made it a home
sound familiar
im sorryuhhuh
no im really sorry
but that isnt russell
it doesnt have to be him
if you knew what i knew
yeah hes got anger issues
maybe a small
learning disability
splash of diabetes
but nothing
that cant be fixed
if you could go back
and stop the people that took
your girl would you
no
id buy them all
a bouquet of hand jobs
of course i fucking would
but i wouldnt kill a kid
im not asking you
to kill a kid
ill kill the kid
im asking you to save
hundreds of other kids
russells gonna burn down
that orphanage
and i can imagine
your dead girlfriend
would want you to do
the right thing wouldnt she
so whats it gonna be
handsome
give me a chance to save him
what you said
once he kills someone
he gets a taste for it
if we can get to him
before that happens
promise youll give me
a chance
to put him
on a different path
define chance
i dont know
how long does it take
to save someones soul
thats not
ill give you 30 seconds
what no best i can do
take it or leave it
cable groansweasel hes doing it

what kind of film this was
if theres anything
you take away today
other than the need to google
what the fuck is dubstep
its that we all need
to belong to someone
how something
so small generates
enough energy
to reverse time is
oh just fix it eleven
