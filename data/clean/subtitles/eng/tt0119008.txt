you hear yourself 
the man i married was a college man

yeah  if everything s okay 
what are you doing here 
mind if we come inside  mrs  pistone 
i m not sure  that depends 
at that point  he became hysterical 
as if the bureau were responsible
for this audit 
  whereas  well  self evidently   
  did you ever think of giving him a raise 
the only way to give him a raise
would be to upgrade him 
yeah 
gs 14 is a supervisor  maggie 
so he s a supervisor 
but he s undercover 
he s not supervising anyone 
the point is 
that s the last time we heard from him 
standard procedure is that
he is to check in with us every day 
maybe he might miss a day or two
here and there  but   
  it was three weeks ago 
  i want you to tell me
where my husband is 
i demand that
you tell me where my husband is 
  we can t tell you because we don t know 
  if he gets in touch with you 
you have got to try to talk sense into him 
mrs  pistone  please help us here 
  you want me to help you out 
  yes 
you want me to help out the fbl
that used my husband and sucked him dry 
so that a bunch of supervisors
could become sacs
and prosecutors could become judges
and assholes like you
could get promoted to gs 16 
maggie  come on  you don t mean that 
let me tell you something 
i hope he crossed over 
mrs  pistone  there is a war going on
in the mafia family where joe is undercover 
three leaders of a rival faction
have been murdered 
he s right in the line of fire 
not because he s one of us 
because he s one of them 
who he s with and who he s close to 
they re all the top dogs now 
it s just not a problem we anticipated 
we have got to pull him out 
you have got to talk to him 
he ll listen to you 
you think so 
he was here a week ago 
he snuck into the house after i was asleep 
and he didn t even wake me up 
didn t even say hello to me
