im not sure that depends
at that point he became hysterical
as if the bureau were responsible
for this audit
whereas well selfevidently
did you ever think of giving him a raise
the only way to give him a raise
would be to upgrade him
yeah
gs14 is a supervisor maggie
so hes a supervisor
but hes undercover
hes not supervising anyone
the point is
thats the last time we heard from him
standard procedure is that
he is to check in with us every day
maybe he might miss a day or two
here and there but
it was three weeks ago
i want you to tell me
where my husband is
i demand that
you tell me where my husband is
we cant tell you because we dont know
if he gets in touch with you
you have got to try to talk sense into him
mrs pistone please help us here
you want me to help you out
yes
you want me to help out the fbl
that used my husband and sucked him dry
so that a bunch of supervisors
could become sacs
and prosecutors could become judges
and assholes like you
could get promoted to gs16
maggie come on you dont mean that
let me tell you something
i hope he crossed over
mrs pistone there is a war going on
in the mafia family where joe is undercover
three leaders of a rival faction
have been murdered
