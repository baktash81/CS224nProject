 chuckles 
 people screaming 
 screaming continues 
 tires screeching 
get klump in here now 
boy 1   professor klump 
good morning 
girl 1   hey  professor 
good morning 
boy 2  morning

girl 2  good morning 
professor klump 
how are you 
morning 
 screaming continues 
 blower engine starts 
 screaming 
oh  my goodness 
professor klump  the cages 
what happened 
that is most peculiar  jason 
because l distinctly remember
locking up last night 
l locked these cages 
picked up my portfolio
and turned around   
 students gasping
and chattering 
oh 
l must ve grazed the switch 
shelley s the only one
that didn t get out 
good  l ll tend to shelley 
you students take care
of this  excuse me 
hello  shelley 
how are you today 
my little powder puff 
yeah  yeah 
 murmuring baby talk 
sir 
you may want to look
at the latest test results 
l m not sure
if l m reading them correctly 
she s lost three ounces
since the last feed 
must be some kind
of mistake 
 keyboard keys clicking 
no  no  jason 
her entire molecular structure
has been realigned 
we ve done it 
this new formula s working 
lt s actually reconstructed
shelley s dna 
she lost 20 
of her body fat
in one feeding 
what if we upped
the dosage 
no  one step at a time 
we don t want
to jeopardize shelley 
we ll keep the feedings
as scheduled 
okay 
schedule  excuse me 
l m very late 
students  we got
a lot of work to do
and don t have much time
to do it in 
trying to win a grant here 
so  as arsenio used to say 
 let s get busy  
 switches lever 
 students chattering 
 rustling and squeaking 
 clears throat and grunts 
 exhales slowly 
comfy 
quite 
anything l can get for you 
juice  coffee  rack of lamb 
no  sir  l m fine 
 sniffs 
 clears throat 
you did want to see me
about something 
didn t you  sir 
well  professor klump 
allow me
to answer that question
by posing another 
why are you trying
to destroy my school 
beg your pardon  sir 
do you know who
louise vindovik is 
oh  surely  sir 
she s a lovely woman
who so generously
donates money
to help fund
our science department 
close  very close 
but wrong 
see  she was a lovely woman 
and she used to fund
our science department 
that was before
she was hospitalized
for nearly swallowing
a gerbil 
not gerbil  sir  a hamster 
gerbils are more streamlined
and hamsters have
a tendency to be fluffier 
the male hamster s scrotum
has a tendency
to be
disproportionately   
never mind 
those national rifle people
are right 
lf l had one now   bang 
sir  l d like to concentrate
on the positives 
what miss vindovik witnessed
was 5 000 healthy hamsters
bred from a genetically
deficient hereditary line 
lt s actually very exciting 
do l look excited  klump 
no  you don t look
excited at all 
but maybe you might
be holding it in 
your excitement 
not wanting to express it 
now listen to me carefully 
you fat tub of goo 
for years you ve
single handedly alienated
every wealthy donor we ve had 
air conditioning schools
are outdrawing us 
we ve lost so much money 
red is our school color 
lnner city schools have
better computers than we do 
bosnia wants
to give us money 
l m going to set up a meeting
with harlan hartley   
klump  are you listening 
yes  sir  yes 
hartley is the last
rich alumnus we ve got 
and he s a science fan 
and he s considering
donating a  10 million grant
to this school 
and l want that money  klump 
yourjob depends upon it 
l ll let you know
how to handle it 
since l ll be watching you 
now go 
but  sir  l don t know
if you should   
see  right back there 
just before you said
 but  sir  right there 
that was the end
of the meeting 
well  l guess l ll leave 
you have a pleasant day 
grace  the cream
has turned again 
 gasps 
professor 
of all the equations
you ll learn
during the course
of your studies here 
this equation shall be 
l promise you 
the most helpful
throughout the course
of your studies 
because this equation
fundamentally breaks down
what dna is composed of 
and what components of dna   
 giggling continues 
 louder laughter 
l seem to have messed myself 
l haven t really
messed myself 
l mean 
l messed my shirt up 
 school bell rings

of sorts with miss purty 
professor  if you feel

sir  you can t control him 
jason  you have no idea

the way people talk to him
and treat him  and the way
she looks at him 
but he s dangerous 
he almost killed us
last night 
we should be concentrating
on getting the grant proposal
to harlan hartley 
this is nuts 
l guess you re right  jason

lf you eat
nasty stuff like this   
l know it looks good 
and some of y all
like pork chops

nasty pork chop 
do you realize
there s a gene in your dna
that routes this
straight to your fat cells 
and it causes
unsightly conditions 
case in point  this woman
is suffering from what
l like to call  jell o arms  
the arm is taking on
a gelatin sort of vibe 
lt s quite nasty 
to my left  this gentleman

like l was saying 
everybody  where there s
a will  there s a way 
there is a way
we can turn these genes off 
l m not talking about
using exercise or diet

by taking a simple solution
that helps reconstruct
your metabolic
cellular strands
