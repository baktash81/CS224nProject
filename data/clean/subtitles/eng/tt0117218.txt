girl 2 good morning
professor klump

screaming continues
blower engine starts
screaming
oh my goodness
professor klump the cages
what happened
that is most peculiar jason
because l distinctly remember
locking up last night
l locked these cages
picked up my portfolio
and turned around
students gasping
and chattering
oh
l mustve grazed the switch
shelleys the only one
that didnt get out
good lll tend to shelley
you students take care
of this excuse me
hello shelley
how are you today
my little powder puff
yeah yeah
murmuring baby talk
sir
you may want to look
at the latest test results
lm not sure
if lm reading them correctly
shes lost three ounces
since the last feed
must be some kind
of mistake
keyboard keys clicking
no no jason
her entire molecular structure
has been realigned
weve done it
this new formulas working
lts actually reconstructed
shelleys dna
she lost 20
of her body fat
in one feeding
what if we upped
the dosage
no one step at a time
we dont want
to jeopardize shelley
well keep the feedings
as scheduled
okay
schedule excuse me
lm very late
students we got
a lot of work to do
and dont have much time
to do it in
trying to win a grant here
so as arsenio used to say
lets get busy
switches lever
students chattering
rustling and squeaking
clears throat and grunts
exhales slowly
comfy
quite
anything l can get for you
juice coffee rack of lamb
no sir lm fine
sniffs
clears throat
you did want to see me
about something
didnt you sir
well professor klump
allow me
to answer that question
by posing another
why are you trying
to destroy my school
beg your pardon sir
do you know who
louise vindovik is
oh surely sir
shes a lovely woman
who so generously
donates money
to help fund
our science department
close very close
but wrong
see she was a lovely woman
and she used to fund
our science department
that was before
she was hospitalized
for nearly swallowing
a gerbil
not gerbil sir a hamster
gerbils are more streamlined
and hamsters have
a tendency to be fluffier
the male hamsters scrotum
has a tendency
to be
disproportionately
never mind
those national rifle people
are right
lf l had one nowbang
sir ld like to concentrate
on the positives
what miss vindovik witnessed
was 5000 healthy hamsters
bred from a genetically
deficient hereditary line
lts actually very exciting
do l look excited klump
no you dont look
excited at all
but maybe you might
be holding it in
your excitement
not wanting to express it
now listen to me carefully
you fat tub of goo
for years youve
singlehandedly alienated
every wealthy donor weve had
airconditioning schools
are outdrawing us
weve lost so much money
red is our school color
lnnercity schools have
better computers than we do
bosnia wants
to give us money
lm going to set up a meeting
with harlan hartley
klump are you listening
yes sir yes
hartley is the last
rich alumnus weve got
and hes a science fan
and hes considering
donating a 10 million grant
to this school
and l want that money klump
yourjob depends upon it
lll let you know
how to handle it
since lll be watching you
now go
but sir l dont know
if you should
see right back there
just before you said
but sir right there
that was the end
of the meeting
well l guess lll leave
you have a pleasant day
grace the cream
has turned again
gasps
professor
of all the equations
youll learn
during the course
of your studies here
this equation shall be
l promise you
the most helpful
throughout the course
of your studies
because this equation
fundamentally breaks down
what dna is composed of
and what components of dna
giggling continues
louder laughter
l seem to have messed myself
l havent really
messed myself
l mean
l messed my shirt up
school bell rings
but make sure
you read chapter 4
in your textbooks

reasons of my own jason
l have a case of infatuation
of sorts with miss purty

sir you cant control him
jason you have no idea
what it feels like
to be buddy love
lts indescribable

the way people talk to him

she looks at him
but hes dangerous
he almost killed us
last night
we should be concentrating

everybody where theres
a will theres a way
there is a way
we can turn these genes off
lm not talking about
using exercise or diet

your metabolic
cellular strands
thus giving you
the appearance of
in medical terms
gluteus minimus

an extremely tight
wonderful ass
