someone did
the agent program was
initiated in august of 1967
by a man named peter aaron litvenko
its purpose was to create
the perfect killing machine
human beings without emotion
or fear or remorse
the resulting subjects were called agents
the program was a success
but the price of creating men without
humanity was litvenkos conscience
applying his brilliant mind
to his flight he vanished
fearing that it would be exposed
the govt shut down the program
and surviving agents drifted
into shadows
realizing its potential many
tried to restart the program
all failed
so they focused their efforts
on finding the one man who could
the task fell to
dr albert delriego
a ruthless and efficient man
bu litvenko had disappeared
and even he couldnt find him
then 6 years into his search
delriego made an unexpected discovery
a single photograph which would
become the key to finding litvenko
noone had ever imagined
that in the end
it would come down
to one little  girl

i dont know much
only that hes a genecist
an expert on human biogenetics
who spearheaded a
program of experimentation
what kind of experiments
the kind that created killers
the engineered human beings
by targeting specific genes
the resulting subjects were faster stronger
more intelligent than normal people
they programmed out pain fear
even love
they called them agents
and your father was one of the
lead scientists of the program
you cant be serious
what does this have anything to
do with me
and why do they want to kill me
kriton technologies
has restarted the agent program
theyre building agents right now
like 47 maybe worse
they belive that youre the
key to finding your father
i dont understand
your father knows their weakness
he knows how to stop them
katia

is your name really john smith
its brian
well at least you didnt
say i was agent 46
no thats someone else
come here let me help you
youre going to be alright
no lie
im sorry
for what
for having to tell you
who your father is
well you told me the truth
thats more than anyone ever has
why is it that they think
i can find him john
doesnt matter now
but it does
tell me what you know
i know that youre in danger
the best thing you could do
right now is hide
ive been hiding my entire life
please
tell me what you know
im authorized to protect you
katia not find your father
dont do this
i have to
okay
when we were researching your
father we found a file
it mentiined you it said that
said what
it said that he changed you
changed me how
it said that he had enhanced
your survival skills
its why we think youve been
hiding
why youve been able to stay
off the radar been to stay alive
thats why i was always afraid
yes
jesus
they think i know how to
find my father
what is this
its my fathers life
what else do you know about him
just what i told you
you must have something
how old is he
seventy two
where was he born
ukraine
medical conditions

arthritis in his 40s
somewhere warm then
what else
lung cancer
last known sighting was
in a hospital seúl korea in 2011
he was engaged in some clinical trials

i think so
somewhere warm with advanced
medical facilities
a city
hobbies
what does he love to do
orchids
he was an expert in orchids
what languages did he speak john
english russian mandarín and tamil
why tamil
because your mother was from sri lanka
you know where he is dont you
katia
you told me you wanted to do this
and i told you i would do it with you
but if you want my help you
have to tell me where he is
weve lost the girl
you told me that your john smith
would be adequate
we underestimated this agent
find litvenko
whatever it takes
and garad better this girl dead
than this agent finding litvenko
before we do
katia
katia
do you know why youre still alive
because i chose not to kill you
but they will
after they use you
to find your father
what do you know about my father
as much as you do
everything will be alright
no
time to make a choice katia
them or me
why should i trust you
you dont have to
just trust you memories

peter we have to go
your fathers lab

you can ask him yourself
untie me
you have a lot to learn katia
we dont have a lot of time
untie yourself
that took you too long
i didnt know that was a test
everything is a test
keep taking these youll fail
hey i need them
what you need is a clear head
stop fighting what you are
and what am i
keep asking questions
youll probably be dead
what am i
youre the same as me only better
bullshit
im just katia van dess
you speak french spanish mandarín
where did you learn them
how did you free yourself from the rope
youve been programmed
and your name isnt katia van dees

french for 90
so im 43 versions better than you
so they know
if they knew
youd be the target
come on lets go
if you need my help to find
my father why did you shoot me
i didnt shoot you i marked you
there is so many
if i shoot one the rest will converge
so what do we do katia
avoid them
no suppress your fear
and face the threat
your father programmed you to see and hear
everything at extremely hightend levels
you process that information
to anticipate a threat
so anticipate it
katia

he wanted me to know he beat me
well what the fuck is he
people just dont walk away from
four bullets they just dont
subdermal titanium body armour
injected under the skin
in liquid form
its flexible extremely strong
he had his nervous system heightened
wired for speed

thyre coming scan the
reentry points
yes sir
the syndicate ties into those
cameras isnt it
theyre tied to everything
will you hold this please
thanks
how do you fight against that
by playing the odds
doing the unexpected
take nothing for granted
everything you do has a reason
what does that mean
jacket give me your bag
right now
it means avoid those cameras
okay
i know that took me too long
ask you a question
am i going to end up like you
bombs
moths
italian wool they love it
target located
did it hurt
yes
you all
the barcode is given to
us when we are born
the number
when we become agents
hell be there in the morning
at about 900
its when the orchids
are in full bloom
you know hes dying
lung cancer
he needs an inhaler
now to breathe
are you human
is just that john said youre incapable
of feeling fear or remorse
its all been suppressed
is that true
yes
what about love
i am what i need to be
what does that mean
in this job sometimes
its better not to feel anything
im not talking about the job
i think youre lying
i dont believe you can just
turn off fear or love
i dont believe anyone can
youre either a person or something
else which is it
are you asking me or yourself
you cant fight who you are katia
youll lose
is that what happened to you
you fought who you are and you lost
people can change
dont put your faith in me
youll be disappointed
i still have a job to do
which is
right now i need to sleep
when i get anxious and i cant sleep
i take things apart
im sorry
dont ever do that again
were they syndicate
no freelance
friends of yours
so the syndicate doesnt
know were here
theres a open contract out on
us what do you think
here try not to take this apart
smells bad
robert please
how did they find us so quick
you tell me
no games
what makes you think this is a game
the cameras in the terminal
didnt see me
but the one outside near the
exit did
getting pretty good at this
arent i
no youre sloppy
but im going to have an attack
bee a good boy
here take your inhalor
itll be alrght
excuse me
where did you get that
i traded it
for what
your knife
bring litvenko
and the girl to me
you shouldnt have come
you know who i am
you are your mothers daughter
why did you leave me
i wanted you to have
no part of what i was
i wanted you to live
you had no right
to walk away from you
to turn me into this isolated
afraid thing that i am
you had no right
walk with me katia
i loved your mother very much
she was a light
in a very dark world
and more than anything else
she wanted a child
but she was unable
so we broke every rule we had
and we made you
we knew that if you were discovered
they would take you from us
so we gave you
the tools to be free
this isnt freedom
no perhaps not katia
but it is necessary
for your survival
now i dont expect you to understand
but i do ask that you
find it in yourself
to forgive an old mans selfishness
and if i cant
you will because you are the
reflection of the woman i loved
im ready
get it over with
do it now
hes not going to kill you
father
yes he will
its inevitable
killing is what he is programmed to do
and who he is
isnt that right 47
youre wrong
we determine who we are
by what we do
you believe
you have a choice
i believe thats
what makes us human
then it seems
that you and your brother
have a lot to teach
this old man
i guess i gave you
family after all
move
i got you
seal the building
go
what do they want
more of me
why would anyone
want more of you
one and two stay on him
three and four cut him off
cut him off
theyre boxed in
theyve got nowhere else to go
right or left katia
straight ahead
trust me
holy shit
i want this building sealed
perhaps you should consider shooting him
subdermal body armour
what they actually got that to work
yup
drive the fucken car faster
faster faster
we wont be able to make it
trust me
i want all units on station
well take them in the city
this is never going to end is it
im afraid not
he will never stop
who
antoine le clerq
hes the syndicate chairman
what if we kill this le clerq
will it end then
we cant
maybe not but you can
nobody ever gets close enough
to leclerk to kill him
he nver leaves his protected offce
nobody ever goes in
hes surrounded at all times
by security
fourteen
thats how many agents
have tried

youre nothing more than a scared little
girl whos only real gift is running
damn you
dna sequences doctor
adaptive mutated bacteria fissures
the epistasis rings
transfer rna
come on doc
i dont want to do this
believe me you dont want
me to do this either
so tell me what i need to know
tell me
how to make an agent
this is just experimental doc
ive seen it work
and believe me when i tell
you dont want to be the one
youre a bastard
i know
no you dont
youre a result of
inferior techonologies
a failed experiment
an agents advantage is not
his body john smith
its his mind
you will never be as good as him
inject him
for fucks sake doctor
give me what i need
shit
mr chairman
are you alright
no i am not
i need the chairmans detail
the chairman is out
emergecny services please
can i have your location please
dose him again
you could kill him
do it
oh fuck it
its the chairman
whats happening
whats he doing out of his office
its quite enough john
you can wait outside
all of you
its okay john
petya
can you hear me
i am going to be completely
honest with you
i admire you
you have created something unique
a better human being
and i want it
i have bet my wealth
my company my reputation
everyting on the success of this program
you understand
good thing i sold your stock then
you and i are so very different
you know this
youre wrong
people can change
no
no not people like us
what you did
when you chose to play god
can never be undone
you cant run from what you are
so i should
embrace it
restart the program
with you as its head
yes
you always were a small man antoine
a derivitive thinker at best
this desperation suits you
the key to everything
is in your mind
and youre going to give it to me
tell me how to build an agent
you dont want an agent
then what do i want
an army
and i wont give it to you
then youre going to die
im already dead
yes what about your daughter
you dont have her
no but i will
eventually
give me what i want
and ill leave her in peace
i give you what you want
there wont be no peace
mr chairman
where is he
how did he get into our system
i dont know mr chairman
im assuming by your reaction
that you know who i am
what do you want
to make a deal
you have nothing i need
youre wrong
you want whats inside
litvenkos head
but he wont give it to you
i can
how
window
you want the next
generation of agents
but youve been
looking in the wrong place
you thought the girl was
the only way to find litvenko
a means to an end
the truth is
she is the end
thats right everything you need
the strength the speed
the intelligence is right there
locked inside her dna
so you want to trade him for her
why
because i always
close my contracts
fuck you
theres a helipad on the roof
get him someplace secure
heading up to the safe room
i want all teams to floor 40
thats not going to be enough john
no you stay with me
protect me
so many choices
and only one right answer
whats it gonna be
emotion or duty
it was too quick
fire dept was here too quick
someone called them before the crash
what does that mean
it means he was never
in that helicopter
get them out
what was your mistake
i dont make mistakes
you needed me to know
that you were better than me
where is he
on the roof
when this is done i will kill you
your mother would be proud of you
what
nothing
i doubt youd understand
doesnt matter
well find her
i believe you will
confirm target termination
target
le clerq antoine
terminated
and the other
second target
second target
le clerq
he was your target the whole time
everything that you told me
was youd have a diversion
it was necessary
what to kill a single man
no
to put a stop to the agent program
once and for all
and to set you free
your father loved you katia
he understood that leclerk would not
rest once he knew who you were
that he would hunt you down
so he did what any parent would
he died to save his children
this is your mission isnt it
we determine who we are
by what we do
there is a building full of
