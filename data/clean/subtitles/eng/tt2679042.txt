someone did 
the agent program was
initiated in august of 1967   
by a man named peter aaron litvenko 
it s purpose was to create
the perfect killing machine 
human beings without emotion 
or fear  or remorse 
the resulting subjects were called agents 
the program was a success 
but the price of creating men without
humanity  was litvenko s conscience 
applying his brilliant mind
to his flight  he vanished 
fearing that it would be exposed 
the govt shut down the program 
and surviving agents drifted
into shadows 
realizing it s potential  many
tried to re start the program 
all failed 
so they focused their efforts
on finding the one man who could 
the task fell to
dr  albert delriego 
a ruthless  and efficient man 
bu litvenko had disappeared
and even he couldn t find him 
then  6 years into his search   
delriego made an unexpected discovery 
a single photograph  which would
become the key to finding litvenko 
no one had ever imagined 
that in the end   
it would come down
to one  little    girl

program of experimentation 
what kind of experiments 
the kind that created killers

by targeting specific genes 
the resulting subjects were faster  stronger 
more intelligent than normal people 
they programmed out pain  fear  
even love 
they called them agents 
and your father was one of the
lead scientists of the program 
you can t be serious 
what does this have anything to
do with me 
and why do they want to kill me 
kriton technologies

they re building agents right now 
like 47  maybe worse

it said that he had enhanced
your survival skills 
it s why we think you ve been
hiding   
why you ve been able to stay
off the radar  been to stay alive 
  that s why i was always afraid

medical facilities 
a city 
hobbies 
what does he love to do 
orchids 
he was an expert in orchids 
what languages did he speak  john

and i told you i would do it with you   
but if you want my help  you
have to tell me where he is 
we ve lost the girl 
you told me that your john smith
would be adequate 
we underestimated this agent 
find litvenko 
whatever it takes

than this agent finding litvenko
before we do

subdermal titanium body armour

it s when the orchids
are in full bloom 
you know he s dying 
lung cancer 
he needs an inhaler
now to breathe 
are you human 
is just that john said you re incapable
of feeling fear or remorse
it s all been suppressed 
is that true 
yes 
what about love 
i am what i need to be 
what does that mean 
in this job  sometimes
it s better not to feel anything
i m not talking about the job
i think you re lying
i don t believe you can just
turn off fear or love
i don t believe anyone can 
you re either a person or something
else  which is it 
are you asking me  or yourself 
you can t fight who you are  katia 
you ll lose 
is that what happened to you 
you fought who you are  and you lost 
people can change 
don t put your faith in me 
you ll be disappointed 
i still have a job to do 
which is 
right now  i need to sleep 
when i get anxious  and i can t sleep 
i take things apart 
i m sorry 
don t ever do that again 
were they syndicate 
no  free lance 
friends of yours 
so  the syndicate doesn t
know we re here 
there s a open contract out on
us  what do you think 
here  try not to take this apart 
  smells bad 
  robert  please 
  how did they find us so quick 
  you tell me 
  no games 
  what makes you think this is a game 
the cameras in the terminal
didn t see me 
but the one outside  near the
exit  did 
getting pretty good at this 
aren t i 
no  you re sloppy 
but  i m going to have an attack 
bee a good boy 
here  take your inhalor 
it ll be alrght 
excuse me 
  where did you get that 
  i traded it 
  for what 
  your knife 
bring litvenko
and the girl to me 
you shouldn t have come 
you know who i am 
you are your mother s daughter 
why did you leave me 
i wanted you to have
no part of what i was 
i wanted you to live 
you had no right 
to walk away from you 
to turn me into this isolated 
afraid thing that i am 
you had no right 
walk with me  katia 
i loved your mother very much 
she was a light   
in a very dark world 
and more than anything else  
she wanted a child 
but she was unable 
so  we broke every rule we had   
and we made you 
we knew that if you were discovered   
they would take you from us 
so we gave you   
the tools to be free 
this isn t freedom 
no  perhaps not  katia 
but it is necessary
for your survival 
now  i don t expect you to understand   
but i do ask that you
find it in yourself   
to forgive an old man s selfishness 
and if i can t 
you will  because you are the
reflection of the woman i loved 
i m ready 
get it over with 
do it now 
he s not going to kill you   
father 
yes he will 
it s inevitable 
killing is what he is programmed to do 
and who he is 
isn t that right  47 
you re wrong 
we determine who we are
by what we do 
you believe    
you have a choice 
i believe that s
what makes us human 
then it seems   
that you and your brother   
have a lot to teach
this old man 
i guess i gave you
family  after all 
move 
i got you 
seal the building

  more of me 
why would anyone
want more of you 
one and two stay on him

cut him off 
they re boxed in 
they ve got nowhere else to go 
right or left  katia 
straight ahead 
trust me 
holy shit 
i want this building sealed 
perhaps you should consider shooting him 
subdermal body armour 
what  they actually got that to work 
yup 
drive the fucken car faster 
faster  faster 
we won t be able to make it 
trust me 
i want all units on station

the epistasis rings 
transfer rna 
come on  doc

this is just experimental  doc 
i ve seen it work   
and believe me when i tell
you don t want to be the one 
you re a bastard 
i know 
no  you don t 
you re a result of
inferior techonologies 
a failed experiment 
an agent s advantage is not
his body  john smith 
it s his mind 
you will never be as good as him 
inject him 
for fuck s sake doctor 
give me what i need 
shit 
mr  chairman 
are you alright 
no  i am not 
i need the chairman s detail 
the chairman is out

do it 
oh  fuck it 
it s the chairman 
what s happening 
what s he doing out of his office 
it s quite enough  john 
you can wait outside 
all of you 
it s okay  john 
petya 
can you hear me 
i am going to be completely
honest with you 
i admire you 
you have created something unique 
a better human being 
and i want it 
i have bet my wealth 
my company  my reputation   
everyting on the success of this program 
you understand 
good thing i sold your stock  then 
you and i are so very different 
you know this 
you re wrong 
people can change 
no 
no  not people like us 
what you did   
when you chose to play god 
can never be undone 
you can t run from what you are 
so i should    
embrace it 
re start the program
with you as it s head 
yes 
you always were a small man  antoine 
a derivitive thinker  at best 
this desperation suits you 
the key to everything   
is in your mind 
and you re going to give it to me 
tell me how to build an agent 
you don t want an agent 
then  what do i want 
an army 
and i won t give it to you 
then you re going to die 
i m already dead 
yes  what about your daughter 
you don t have her 
no  but i will   
eventually 
give me what i want
and i ll leave her in peace 
i give you what you want
there won t be no peace 
mr  chairman 
where is he 
how did he get into our system 
i don t know  mr  chairman 
i m assuming by your reaction 
that you know who i am
what do you want 
to make a deal 
  you have nothing i need 
  you re wrong 
you want what s inside
litvenko s head   
but he won t give it to you 
i can 
how 
window 
you want the next
generation of agents   
but you ve been
looking in the wrong place 
you thought the girl was
the only way to find litvenko 
a means to an end 
the truth is   
she is the end 
that s right  everything you need 
the strength  the speed   
the intelligence  is right there 
locked inside her dna 
so you want to trade him for her 
why 
because i always
close my contracts 
fuck you 
there s a helipad on the roof 
get him someplace secure 
  heading up to the safe room 
  i want all teams to floor 40 
that s not going to be enough  john 
no  you stay with me 
protect me 
so many choices 
and only one right answer 
what s it gonna be 
emotion or duty 
it was too quick 
fire dept was here too quick 
  someone called them before the crash 
  what does that mean 
it means he was never
in that helicopter 
get them out 
what was your mistake 
i don t make mistakes 
you needed me to know
that you were better than me 
where is he 
on the roof 
when this is done  i will kill you 
your mother would be proud of you 
what 
nothing
