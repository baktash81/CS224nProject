mum fancies him 
man 2  make way there  please 
let me by  madam  thank you 
excuse me  little girl 
this is for the daily prophet 
it can t be  harry potter 
photographer 
harry potter 
excuse me  madam 
nice big smile  harry 
together  you and i rate the front page 
ladies and gentlemen 
what an extraordinary moment this is 
when young harry stepped
into flourish and blotts this morning   
   to purchase my autobiography 
magical me   
   which  incidentally 
is currently celebrating   
   its 27th week atop
the daily prophet bestseller list   
   he had no idea that he would 
in fact  be leaving   
   with my entire collected works   
   free of charge 
now  ladies 
harry  now you give me those 
and i ll get them signed 
all of you wait outside 
that s it 
i ll bet you loved that 
didn t you  potter 
famous harry potter  can t go into a
bookshop without making the front page 
leave him alone 
look  potter 
you ve got yourself a girlfriend 
now  now  draco  play nicely 
mr  potter 
lucius malfoy  we meet at last 
forgive me 
your scar is legend 
as  of course  is the wizard
who gave it to you 
voldemort killed my parents 
he was nothing more than a murderer 
you must be very brave
to mention his name 
or very foolish 
fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself 
and you must be miss granger 
yes  draco has told me
all about you  and your parents 
muggles  aren t they 
let me see 
red hair  vacant expressions   
   tatty  secondhand book 
you must be the weasleys 
it s mad in here 
let s go outside 
lucius  well  weasley senior 
  lucius 
busy time at the ministry  arthur 
all those extra raids 
i do hope they re paying you overtime   
   but judging by the state of this 
i d say not 
what s the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard   
   if they don t even pay you well for it 
we have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard  malfoy 
clearly 
associating with muggles 
and i thought your family
could sink no lower 
i ll see you at work 
see you at school 
mr  weasley 
10 58  come on 
mrs  weasley

we ll get you a seat  hurry 
let s go 
  what do you two think you re doing 
  sorry 
lost control of the trolley 
  why can t we get through 
  i don t know 
the gateway has sealed
itself for some reason 
the train leaves at exactly 11 00 
we ve missed it 
harry  if we can t get through   
   maybe mum and dad can t get back 
maybe we should just go
and wait by the car 
the car 
ron  i should tell you   
   most muggles aren t accustomed
to seeing a flying car 
right 
okay 
oh  no  the invisibility booster
must be faulty 
come on  then  let s go lower 
we need to find the train 
okay 
harry  all we need to do
is catch up with the train 
we can t be far behind 
 train whistle blows 
  do you hear that 
  we must be getting close 
hold on 
harry 
hold on 
take my hand 
hold on 
i m trying  your hand s all sweaty 
  i think we found the train 
  yeah 
welcome home 
 car engine sputters 
up  up 
it s not working 
up  ron  mind that tree 
stop  stop  stop 
  my wand  look at my wand 
  be thankful it s not your neck 
  what s happening 
  i don t know 
harry 
come on  go  fast 
scabbers  you re okay 
the car 
dad s gonna kill me 
harry 
see you  hedwig 
so a house elf shows up
in my bedroom   
   we can t get through the barrier
to platform 9 3 4   
   we almost get killed by a tree   
clearly someone doesn t want me
here this year 
well  take a good look  lads 
this night might well be
the last you spend in this castle 
oh  dear  we are in trouble 
snape  you were seen by no less
than seven muggles 
do you have any idea
how serious this is 
you have risked
the exposure of our world 
not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a whomping willow   
   that s been on these grounds
since before you were born 
honestly  professor snape 
i think it did more damage to us 
silence 
i assure you that were you in slytherin 
and your fate rested with me   
   the both of you would be
on the train home tonight 
  as it is  
dumbledore  they are not 
professor dumbledore 
professor mcgonagall 
headmaster   
   these boys have flouted the decree
for the restriction of underage wizardry 
  as such  
  i am well aware of our bylaws   
   having written
quite a few of them myself 
however  as head of gryffindor house   
   it is for professor mcgonagall
to determine the appropriate action 
we ll go and get our stuff  then 
what are you
talking about  mr  weasley 
you re going to expel us  aren t you 
not today  mr  weasley   
   but i must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done 
i will be writing to your families tonight 
and you will both receive detention 
morning  everyone 
  good morning  everyone 
  good morning  professor sprout 
sprout  welcome to greenhouse three 
second years  gather around  everyone 
today we re going to re pot mandrakes 
who here can tell me
the properties of the mandrake root 
yes  miss granger 
mandrake  or mandragora   
   is used to return those who have been
petrified to their original state 
it s also dangerous  the mandrake s
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it 
excellent  ten points to gryffindor 
as our mandrakes
are still only seedlings   
   their cries won t kill you yet 
but they could knock you out for hours 
which is why i have given you earmuffs   
   for auditory protection 
so could you please put them on 
right away  quickly 
flaps tight down 
and watch me closely 
you grasp your mandrake firmly 
you pull it sharply up out of the pot 
 mandrake screaming 
got it  and   
   now you dunk it down
into the other pot   
   and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm 
longbottom s been neglecting
his earmuffs 
  no  ma am  he s just fainted 
  yes  well  just leave him there 
right  on we go 
plenty of pots to go around 
grasp your mandrake and pull it up 
boy  there s nearly headless nick 
  hello  percy  miss clearwater 
percy 
hello  sir nicholas 
say it  i m doomed 
  you re doomed 
boy  hi  harry 
i m colin creevey  i m in gryffindor too 
hi  colin  nice to meet you 
ron  is that your owl 
 laughing 
bloody bird s a menace 
oh  no 
look  everyone 
weasley s got himself a howler 
go on  ron  i ignored one
from my gran once  it was horrible 
mrs  weasley s voice 
ronald weasley 
how dare you steal that car 
i am absolutely disgusted 
your father s now facing
an inquiry at work   
   and it s entirely your fault 
if you put another toe out of line   
   we ll bring you straight home 
and  ginny  dear  congratulations
on making gryffindor 
your father and i are so proud 
let me introduce you to your new
defense against the dark arts teacher 
me 
gilderoy lockhart   
   order of merlin  third class   
   honorary member
of the dark force defense league   
   and five times winner   
   of witch weekly s
most charming smile award 
but i don t talk about that 
i didn t get rid of the bandon banshee
by smiling at him 
now  be warned 
it is my job to arm you   
   against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind 
you may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room 
know only that no harm
can befall you whilst i am here 
i must ask you not to scream 
it might provoke them 
cornish pixies 
lockhart 
freshly caught cornish pixies 
laugh if you will  mr  finnegan   
   but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters 
let s see what you make of them 
come on now  round them up 
they re only pixies 
pixie  you just stay there 
neville  please  get me down 
hermione  get off me 
  stop  hold still 
peskipiksi pesternomi 
i ll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage 
what do we do now 
immobulus 
why is it always me 
i spent the summer devising
a whole new quidditch program 
we re gonna train earlier 
harder and longer 
what    i don t believe it 
  where you think you re going  flint 
  quidditch practice 
  i booked the pitch for gryffindor today 
  easy  wood  i ve got a note 
uh oh  i smell trouble 
 l  professor severus snape 
do hereby give the slytherin team   
   permission to practice today  owing
to the need to train their new seeker  
you ve got a new seeker  who 
  malfoy 
  that s right 
and that s not all
that s new this year 
those are nimbus 2001 s 
how did you get those 
a gift from draco s father 
you see  weasley  unlike some 
my father can afford the best 
at least no one on the gryffindor team
had to buy their way in 
they got in on pure talent 
no one asked your opinion 
you filthy little mudblood 
you ll pay for that one  malfoy 
eat slugs 
you okay  ron 
say something 
  wow  can you turn him around  harry 
harry  no  colin  get out of the way 
let s take him to hagrid s 
he ll know what to do 
hagrid  this calls for
a specialist s equipment 
nothing to do but wait till it stops 
i m afraid 
  okay 
  better out than in 
  who was ron trying to curse  anyway 
  malfoy  he called hermione   
well  i don t know
exactly what it means 
he called me a mudblood 
  he did not 
  what s a mudblood 
it means  dirty blood   mudblood s a foul
name for someone who s muggle born 
someone with non magic parents 
someone like me 
it s not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation 
see  the thing is  harry  there are
some wizards  like the malfoy family   
   who think they re better than everyone
else because they re pure blood 
that s horrible 
it s disgusting 
and it s codswallop to boot 
dirty blood 
why  there isn t a wizard alive today
that s not half blood or less 
more to the point  they ve yet to think
of a spell that our hermione can t do 
come here 
don t you think on it  hermione 
don t you think on it for one minute 
aye 
lockhart 
harry  harry  harry 
can you possibly imagine   
   a better way to serve detention   
   than by helping me
to answer my fan mail 
not really 
fame is a fickle friend  harry 
celebrity is as celebrity does 
remember that 
voice 
come 
come   
   to me 
  what 
  sorry 
that voice 
voice 
  didn t you hear it 
  what are you talking about  harry 
i think you re getting
a bit drowsy 
and great scott  no wonder  look at the
time  we ve been here nearly four hours 
spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun 
spooky 
voice 
blood 
i smell blood 
let me rip you 
let me kill you 
kill 
kill 
  kill 
  harry 
harry  did you hear it 
  hear what 
  that voice 
  voice  what voice 
i heard it first in lockhart s office 
and then again just  
it s time 
it s moving 
i think it s going to kill 
ron  kill 
hermione  harry  wait  not so fast 
strange 
  i ve never seen spiders act like that 
  i don t like spiders 
what s that 
hermione   the chamber
of secrets has been opened 
enemies of the heir  beware  
it s written in blood 
oh  no 
it s filch s cat 
it s mrs  norris 
 enemies of the heir  beware  
you ll be next  mudbloods 
what s going on here 
go on  make way  make way 
potter 
what are you    
mrs  norris 
  you ve murdered my cat 
  no no 
filch 
i ll kill you 
  i ll kill you 
dumbledore  argus 
argus  l   
everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately 
everyone except   
   you three 
boy 
ravenclaws  follow me 
she s not dead  argus 
she has been petrified 
ah  thought so 
so unlucky i wasn t there 
i know exactly the countercurse
that could ve spared her 
but how she has been petrified 
l cannot say 
ask him 
it s him that s done it 
you saw what he wrote on the wall 
it s not true  sir  i swear 
i never touched mrs  norris 
  rubbish 
  if i might  headmaster 
perhaps potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time 
however   
   the circumstances are suspicious 
i  for one  don t recall
seeing potter at dinner 
lockhart 
i m afraid that s my doing  severus 
you see  harry was helping me
answer my fan mail 
hermione  that s why ron and i
went looking for him  professor 
we d just found him when he said   
  yes  miss granger 
  when i said i wasn t hungry 
we were heading back to the common
room when we found mrs  norris 
 innocent until proven guilty  severus 
filch  my cat has been petrified 
  i want to see some punishment 
  we will be able to cure her  argus 
as i understand it  madam sprout
has a very healthy growth of mandrake 
when matured  a potion will be made
which will revive mrs  norris 
and in the meantime   
   l strongly recommend caution   
   to all 
hermione  it s a bit strange  isn t it 
  strange 
hermione  you hear this voice 
a voice only you can hear   
   and then mrs  norris turns up
petrified  it s just strange 
do you think i should have told them 
dumbledore and the others  i mean 
are you mad 
no  harry  even in the wizarding world 
hearing voices isn t a good sign 
man in picture 
she s right  you know 
mcgonagall  could i have
your attention  please 
right  now  today 
we will be transforming animals   
   into water goblets 
like so 
one  two  three 
vera verto 
now it s your turn 
who would like to go first 
mr  weasley 
 one  two  three  vera verto  
vera verto 
mcgonagall  that wand needs
replacing  mr  weasley 
  yes  miss granger 
  professor   
   l was wondering if you could tell us
about the chamber of secrets 
very well 
you all know  of course   
   that hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago   
   by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age 
godric gryffindor 
helga hufflepuff   
   rowena ravenclaw
and salazar slytherin 
now  three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously 
  one did not 
  three guesses who 
salazar slytherin wished to be
more selective   
   about the students admitted
to hogwarts 
he believed magical learning should
be kept within all magic families 
in other words  pure bloods 
unable to sway the others 
he decided to leave the school 
now  according to legend   
   slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle   
   known as the chamber of secrets 
though  shortly before departing 
he sealed it   
   until that time when his own
true heir returned to the school 
the heir alone   
   would be able to open the chamber   
   and unleash the horror within 
and by so doing   
   purge the school
of all those who   
   in slytherin s view 
were unworthy to study magic 
muggle borns 
naturally  the school
has been searched many times 
no such chamber has been found 
professor  what exactly does legend
tell us lies within the chamber 
the chamber is said to be home
to something   
   that only the heir of slytherin
can control 
it is said to be the home   
   of a monster 
do you think it s true  do you think
there really is a chamber of secrets 
yes  couldn t you tell  mcgonagall s
worried  all the teachers are 
if there really is a chamber of secrets 
and it has been opened  that means  
the heir of slytherin has returned
to hogwarts  the question is  who is it 
let s think  who do we know who
thinks all muggle borns are scum 
  if you re talking about malfoy  
  of course  you heard him 
 you ll be next  mudbloods  
i heard him 
but malfoy  the heir of slytherin 
maybe ron s right  hermione 
i mean  look at his family 
the whole lot of them have been
in slytherin for centuries 
crabbe and goyle must know 
maybe we could trick them into telling 
even they aren t that thick 
but there might be another way 
mind you  it would be difficult 
not to mention we d be breaking
about 50 school rules   
   and it ll be dangerous 
very dangerous 
hermione 
here it is  the polyjuice potion 
 properly brewed  the polyjuice potion
allows the drinker   
   to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another  
you mean if harry and i drink that stuff 
we ll turn into crabbe and goyle 
  wicked  malfoy will tell us anything 
  exactly 
but it s tricky  i ve never seen
a more complicated potion 
harry  how long will it take to make 
  a month 
a month 
but  hermione 
if malfoy is the heir of slytherin   
   he could attack half
the muggle borns in the school by then 
i know 
but it s the only plan we ve got 
 bell rings 
another goal for slytherin 
they lead gryffindor 90 to 30 
yeah 
yeah 
all right there  scarhead 
watch yourself  harry 
harry 
wood  look out 
blimey  harry s got himself
a rogue bludger 
that s been tampered with  that has 
i ll stop it 
no  even with a proper wand 
it s too risky  you could hit harry 
training for the ballet  potter 
you ll never catch me  potter 
let s go 
lee  harry potter has caught
the snitch  gryffindor wins 
finite lncantatem 
  thank you 
hermione  are you okay 
no  i think my arm is broken 
not to worry  i will fix
that arm of yours straightaway 
  no  not you 
  boy doesn t know what he s saying 
this won t hurt a bit 
brackium emendo 
yes  well 
that can sometimes happen   
   but the point is   
   you can no longer feel any pain  and 
very clearly  the bones are not broken 
broken  there s no bones left 
lockhart 
much more flexible  though 
 groans 
mr  malfoy  stop making such a fuss 
you can go  out of my way 
should have been brought
straight to me 
i can mend bones in a heartbeat 
but growing them back   
you will be able to  won t you 
i ll be able to  certainly 
but it ll be painful 
you re in for a rough night  potter 
regrowing bones is a nasty business 
what do you expect 
pumpkin juice 
voice 
kill 
kill 
time to kill 
hello 
dobby 
harry potter should have listened
to dobby 
harry potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train 
it was you  you stopped the barrier
from letting ron and me through 
indeed  yes  sir 
  you nearly got ron and me expelled 
  at least you would be away from here 
harry potter must go home 
dobby thought his bludger would be
enough to make harry potter see  
your bludger  you made
that bludger chase after me 
dobby feels most aggrieved  sir 
dobby had to iron his hands 
you better clear off before my bones
come back  or i might strangle you 
dobby is used to death threats  sir 
dobby gets them five times a day
at home 
i don t suppose you could tell me
why you re trying to kill me 
not kill you  sir 
never kill you 
dobby remembers how it was
before harry potter triumphed   
   over he who must not be named 
we house elves were
treated like vermin  sir 
of course  dobby is still
treated like vermin 
 sobs 
why do you wear that thing  dobby 
this  sir  it is a mark
of the house elf s enslavement 
dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes 
 rattling 
listen 
listen 
terrible things are
about to happen at hogwarts 
harry potter must not stay here   
   now that history
is to repeat itself 
repeat itself  you mean
this has happened before 
i shouldn t have said that 
  bad dobby  bad 
  stop it 
stop it  dobby 
tell me  when did this happen before 
who s doing it now 
dobby cannot say  sir  dobby
only wants harry potter to be safe 
no  dobby  tell me 
who is it 
 door opens 
pom frey 
put him here 
what happened 
dumbledore 
there s been another attack 
i think he s been petrified 
madam pomfrey 
look  perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker 
mcgonagall 
what can this mean  albus 
it means   
   that our students
are in great danger 
  what should i tell the staff 
dumbledore  the truth 
tell them hogwarts
is no longer safe 
it is as we feared  minerva 
the chamber of secrets
has indeed been opened again 
hermione  you mean the chamber
of secrets has been opened before 
of course 
don t you see 
lucius malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here 
  now he s taught draco how to do it 
  maybe 
we ll have to wait for
the polyjuice potion to know for sure 
enlighten me  why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight   
   in the middle of the girls  lavatory 
don t you think we ll get caught 
no  no one ever comes in here 
  why 
  moaning myrtle 
who 
moaning myrtle 
  who s moaning myrtle 
  i m moaning myrtle 
i wouldn t expect you to know me 
who would ever talk
about ugly  miserable   
   moping moaning myrtle 
 screams 
she s a little sensitive 
lockhart 
gather round 
gather round 
can everybody see me 
can you all hear me 
excellent 
in light of the dark events
of recent weeks   
   professor dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this dueling club   
   to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves   
   as i myself have done
on countless occasions 
for full details 
see my published works 
let me introduce my assistant   
   professor snape 
he has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration 
i don t want any of you
youngsters to worry 
you ll still have your potions master
when i m through with him  never fear 
one 
two 
  three 
  expelliarmus 
  do you think he s all right 
  who cares 
an excellent idea to show them that 
professor snape   
   but if you don t mind me saying  it was
obvious what you were about to do 
if i had wanted to stop you 
it would have been only too easy 
perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students   
   to block unfriendly spells 
professor 
an excellent suggestion 
professor snape 
let s have a volunteer pair 
potter  weasley  how about you 
snape  weasley s wand causes
devastation with the simplest spells 
we ll be sending potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox 
might i suggest someone
from my own house 
malfoy  perhaps 
lockhart  good luck  potter 
  thank you  sir 
lockhart 
wands at the ready 
  scared  potter 
  you wish 
lockhart 
on the count of three   
   cast your charms to disarm
your opponent  only to disarm 
we don t want any accidents here 
one 
  two 
  everte statum 
rictusempra 
 students laughing 
i said disarm only 
serpensortia 
don t move  potter 
i ll get rid of it for you 
allow me  professor snape 
alarte ascendare 
 speaking foreign language 
vipera evanesca 
what are you playing at 
you re a parselmouth 
why didn t you tell us 
  i m a what 
  you can talk to snakes 
i know  i accidentally set a python
on my cousin dudley at the zoo once 
once  but so what 
i bet loads of people here can do it 
no  they can t 
it s not a very common gift  harry 
this is bad 
what s bad  if i hadn t told
that snake not to attack justin  
  that s what you said to it 
  you were there  you heard me 
i heard you speaking parseltongue 
snake language 
i spoke a different language 
but i didn t realize  
how can i speak a language
without knowing i can 
i don t know  but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something 
harry  listen to me 
there s a reason the symbol
of slytherin house is a serpent 
salazar slytherin was a parselmouth 
he could talk to snakes too 
exactly 
now the whole school s gonna think
you re his great great great grandson 
but i m not 
i can t be 
hermione 
he lived a thousand years ago 
for all we know  you could be 
i ll see you back in the common room 
voice 
i want blood 
they all must die 
kill 
kill 
kill 
time to kill 
caught in the act 
i ll have you out this time  potter 
mark my words 
no  mr  filch  you don t understand  
professor   
   l swear i didn t 
this is out of my hands  potter 
professor dumbledore
will be waiting for you 
sherbet lemon 
 people in pictures snoring 
professor dumbledore 
bee in your bonnet  potter 
i was just wondering
if you put me in the right house 
yes  you were particularly
difficult to place 
but i stand by what i said last year 
you would have done well in slytherin 
you re wrong 
dumbledore 
harry 
professor 
your bird   
there was nothing i could do 
  he just caught fire 
  and about time too 
he s been looking dreadful for days 
pity you had to see him
on a burning day 
fawkes is a phoenix  harry 
they burst into flame
when it is time for them to die   
   and then they are   
   reborn from the ashes 
 croaks 
fascinating creatures  phoenixes 
they can carry immensely heavy loads 
their tears have healing powers 
 door opens 
professor dumbledore  sir 
wait  listen 
professor dumbledore  sir 
it wasn t harry 
  hagrid  
 i d swear it in front of the ministry 
hagrid 
relax 
i do not believe   
    that harry attacked anyone 
  of course you don t 
oh 
right  well  i ll   
  i ll just wait outside  then 
  yes 
  you don t think it was me  professor 
  no  harry 
i do not think it was you 
but i must ask you   
   is there something
you wish to tell me 
no  sir 
nothing 
very well  then 
off you go 
everything s set  we just need a bit
of who you re changing into 
crabbe and goyle 
we also need to make sure
that the real crabbe and goyle   
   can t burst in on us
while we re interrogating malfoy 
  how 
 i ve got it all worked out 
i filled these
with a simple sleeping draught 
simple  but powerful 
now  once they re asleep   
   hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs   
   and put on their uniforms 
  whose hair are you ripping out  then 
  i ve already got mine 
millicent bulstrode  slytherin 
i got this off her robes 
i m going to go check
on the polyjuice potion 
make sure that crabbe and goyle
find these 
 clears throat 
ron  maybe i should do it 
yeah  right 
wingardium leviosa 
cool 
how thick could you get 
come on  let s get them 
hermione  we ll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves 
add the hairs 
ugh  essence of crabbe 
hermione 
cheers 
i think i m gonna be sick 
me too 
 groans 
harry 
ron 
bloody hell 
we still sound like ourselves 
you need to sound more like crabbe 
  bloody hell 
  excellent 
  but where s hermione 
hermione  l   
i don t think i m going 
you go on without me 
hermione  are you okay 
hermione 
just go  you re wasting time 
come on 
  the slytherin common room s this way 
  okay 
percy 
excuse me 
what are you doing d   
i mean  what are you doing down here 
i happen to be a school prefect 
you  on the other hand  have no business
wandering the corridors at night 
what are your names again 
  i m   
  crabbe  goyle  where have you been 
pigging out in the great hall
all this time 
why are you wearing glasses 
  reading 
  reading 
i didn t know you could read 
and what are you doing down here 
weasley 
mind your attitude  malfoy 
well  sit down 
you d never know the weasleys
were pure bloods  the way they behave 
they re an embarrassment
to the wizarding world  all of them 
what s wrong with you  crabbe 
stomachache 
i m surprised the daily prophet
hasn t done a report on all these attacks 
i suppose dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up 
father always said dumbledore
was the worst thing   
    that ever happened to this place 
  you re wrong 
what 
you think there s someone here
who s worse than dumbledore 
well  do you 
harry potter 
good one  goyle 
you re absolutely right 
saint potter 
and people actually think
that he s the heir of slytherin 
but then you must have some idea
who s behind it all 
you know i don t  goyle 
i told you yesterday 
how many times do i have to tell you 
is this yours 
but my father did say this 
it s been 50 years
since the chamber was opened 
he wouldn t tell me who opened it 
only that they were expelled 
the last time the chamber of secrets
was opened  a mudblood died 
so it s only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time 
as for me   
   l hope it s granger 
what s the matter with you two 
you re acting very odd 
it s his stomachache 
calm down 
scar 
hair 
hey  where are you going 
that was close 
hermione  come out 
we ve got loads to tell you 
hermione 
go away 
wait till you see  it s awful 
hermione 
are you okay 
hermione 
do you remember me telling you   
   that the polyjuice potion
was only for human transformations 
it was cat hair i plucked off
millicent bulstrode s robes 
look at my face 
look at your tail 
ron 
have you spoken to hermione 
she should be out of hospital
in a few days   
   when she stops coughing up fur balls 
what s this 
ron 
yuck 
harry  looks like moaning myrtle s
flooded the bathroom 
 myrtle whimpering 
  come to throw something else at me 
  why would i throw something at you 
don t ask me  here i am 
minding my own business   
   and someone thinks it s funny
to throw a book at me 
but it can t hurt if someone
throws something at you 
i mean  it ll just go
right through you 
sure  let s all throw books at myrtle
because she can t feel it 
ten points
if you get it through her stomach 
fifty points if it goes through her head 
  but who threw it at you  anyway 
  i don t know  i didn t see them 
i was just sitting in the u bend 
thinking about death   
   and it fell through the top
of my head  uh huh

i understand  tom  but i m afraid   
   headmaster dippet

the chamber of secrets 50 years ago 
hermione  it can t be hagrid

we don t even know this torn riddle 
he sounds like a dirty  rotten snitch 
the monster had killed somebody  ron 
what would any of us have done 
look  hagrid s our friend  why don t
we just go and ask him about it 
that would be a cheerful visit 
 hello  hagrid 
tell us  have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately  
mad and hairy  you wouldn t be talking
about me  now  would you 
no 
what s that you ve got  hagrid 
it s flesh eating slug repellent 
for the mandrakes  you know 
now  according to professor sprout 
they ve still got a bit of growing to do 
but once their acne s cleared up 
we ll chop them up and stew them   
   and then we ll get those people
down at the hospital un petrified 
in the meantime  though  you three   
   had best be looking after yourselves 
all right 
hm 
hello  neville 
harry  i don t know who did it 
but you d better come 
come on 
 hedwig chirping 
hermione  it had to be a gryffindor 
nobody else knows our password 
unless it wasn t a student 
whoever it was  they must have
been looking for something 
harry 
and they found it 
tom riddle s diary is gone 
wood 
all right  listen up 
we play our game 
hufflepuff doesn t stand a chance 
we re stronger  quicker and smarter 
not to mention they re dead scared
that harry will petrify them   
    if they fly anywhere near him 
  well  that too 
professor mcgonagall 
  this match has been canceled 
  we can t cancel quidditch 
silence  wood  you and your teammates
will go to gryffindor tower  now 
potter  you and i will find mr  weasley 
there s something
the both of you have to see 
i warn you 
this could be a wee bit of a shock 
hermione 
mcgonagall 
she was found near the library   
   along with this 
does it mean anything to either of you 
no 
mcgonagall 
could i have your attention  please 
because of recent events  these new
rules will be put into effect immediately 
 all students will return to their house
common rooms by 6 00 every evening 
all students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher 
no exceptions  
i should tell you this 
unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught   
   it is likely the school will be closed 
we ve got to talk to hagrid  ron 
i can t believe it s him   
   but if he did set the monster loose
last time   
   he ll know how to get inside
the chamber of secrets  that s a start 
but you heard mcgonagall 
we re not allowed to leave
the tower except for class 
i think it s time to get
my dad s old cloak out again 
 knocking 
who s there 
hello 
hello 
  what s that for 
  nothing  i was expecting  uh   
it doesn t matter  come on in 
i just made a pot of tea 
hagrid  are you okay 
i m fine  i m all right 
did you hear about hermione 
oh  yeah  i heard about that  all right 
look  we have to ask you something 
do you know who s opened
the chamber of secrets 
what you had to understand
about that is  
 knocking 
 fang barks 
quick  under the cloak 
don t say a word 
be quiet  both of you 
  professor dumbledore  sir 
  good evening  hagrid 
i wonder  could we    
of course  come in  come in 
that s dad s boss 
cornelius fudge  minister of magic 
bad business  hagrid  very bad business 
had to come 
three attacks on muggle borns 
things have gone far enough 
  the ministry s got to act 
  but i never  
you know i never  professor 
i want it understood  cornelius   
   that hagrid   
   has my full confidence 
albus  look 
hagrid s record is against him 
  i ve got to take him 
hagrid  take me 
take me where 
not azkaban prison 
fudge 
i m afraid we have no choice  hagrid 
already here  fudge 
good 
what are you doing here 
get out of my house 
lucius 
believe me   
   l take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your   
you call this a house 
no 
i simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here 
well  what exactly is it
that you want with me 
the other governors and i have decided
it s time for you to step aside 
this is an order of suspension 
you ll find all 12 signatures on it 
i m afraid we feel
you ve rather lost your touch 
well  what with all these attacks   
   there ll be no
muggle borns left at hogwarts 
i can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school 
hagrid  you can t take
professor dumbledore away 
take him away and the muggle borns
won t stand a chance 
you mark my words 
there ll be killings next 
you think so 
dumbledore 
calm yourself  hagrid 
if the governors desire my removal   
   l will  of course  step aside 
however   
   you will find that help
will always be given at hogwarts   
   to those who   
   ask for it 
admirable sentiments 
shall we 
fudge 
come  hagrid 
well 
hagrid 
if   
if anybody was looking for some stuff   
   then all they d have to do
would be to follow the spiders 
yep  that would lead them right 
that s all i have to say 
oh  and someone will need
to feed fang while i m away 
fudge 
good boy 
hagrid s right 
with dumbledore gone 
there ll be an attack a day 
look 
come on 
come on  fang 
come on 
ron 
what 
harry  you heard what hagrid said 
 follow the spiders  
they re heading to the dark forest 
why spiders  why couldn t it be
 follow the butterflies  
 rumbling 
ron 
harry  i don t like this 
  harry  i don t like this at all 
  shush 
can we go back now 
come on 
aragog 
who is it 
don t panic 
aragog 
hagrid 
is that you 
we re friends of hagrid s 
and you 
you re aragog  aren t you 
aragog 
yes 
hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before 
he s in trouble  up at the school 
there have been attacks 
they think it s hagrid 
they think he opened
the chamber of secrets  like before 
aragog 
that s a lie 
hagrid never opened
the chamber of secrets 
  then you re not the monster 
aragog  no 
the monster was born in the castle 
i came to hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler 
  harry 
  shush 
but if you re not the monster  then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago 
aragog 
we do not speak of it 
it is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others 
but have you seen it 
aragog  i never saw any part of the
castle but the box in which i was kept 
the girl was discovered
in a bathroom 
when i was accused 
hagrid brought me here 
  harry 
  what 
well  thank you 
we ll just go 
aragog 
go 
i think not 
my sons and daughters
do not harm hagrid on my command 
but i cannot deny them
fresh meat   
   when it wanders
so willingly into our midst 
goodbye  friend of hagrid 
can we panic now 
know any spells 
one  but it s not powerful
enough for all of them 
where s hermione when you need her 
 car eng i ne roars 
let s go 
harry 
arania exumai 
go 
whoa 
glad we re out of there 
arania exumai 
  thanks for that 
  don t mention it 
harry 
get us out of here 
now 
come on 
come on  move faster 
come on  go 
get us in the air 
the flying gear s jammed 
harry  come on  pull 
  i m trying 
 fang barking 
follow the spiders 
follow the spiders 
if hagrid ever gets out of azkaban 
i ll kill him 
 car starts 
i mean  what was the point
of sending us in there 
  what have we found out 
  we know one thing 
hagrid never opened
the chamber of secrets 
he was innocent 
wish you were here  hermione 
we need you 
now more than ever 
  what s that 
  ron   
this is why hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked 
come on 
 of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land   
   none is more deadly than the basilisk 
capable of living for hundreds of years   
   instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent s eye 
spiders flee before it  
ron  this is it 
the monster in the
chamber of secrets is a basilisk 
that s why i can hear it speak 
it s a snake 
but if it kills by looking people
in the eye  why is it no one s dead 
because no one did look it
in the eye 
not directly  at least 
colin saw it through his camera 
justin   justin must have seen the
basilisk through nearly headless nick 
nick got the full blast of it 
but he s a ghost  he couldn t die again 
and hermione had the mirror 
i bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along 
and mrs  norris 
i m pretty sure she didn t have
a camera or a mirror  harry 
the water 
there was water on the floor that night 
she only saw the basilisk s reflection 
 spiders flee before it  
  it all fits 
  how s the basilisk been getting around 
a dirty  great snake 
someone would have seen it 
harry  hermione s answered that too 
  pipes  it s using the plumbing 
remember what aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago 
she died in a bathroom 
what if she never left 
moaning myrtle 
mcgonagall  all students are to
return to their dormitories at once 
all teachers to the second floor
corridor immediately 
as you can see  the heir of slytherin
has left another message 
our worst fear has been realized 
a student has been taken by the monster
into the chamber itself 
the students must be sent home 
i m afraid this is the end of hogwarts 
so sorry  dozed off 
what have i missed 
a girl has been snatched by the monster 
lockhart  your moment has come at last 
  my moment 
  weren t you saying just last night   
   that you ve known all along where the
entrance to the chamber of secrets is 
that s settled  we ll leave you
to deal with the monster  gilderoy 
  your skills  after all  are legend 
  very well 
i ll just be in my office getting   
getting ready 
who is it that the monster s taken 
minerva 
ginny weasley 
ron   her skeleton will lie
in the chamber forever  
ginny 
harry  lockhart s useless  but he s
going to try and get into the chamber 
at least we can tell him
what we know 
professor  we have some information
for you 
are you going somewhere 
well  yes  urgent call  unavoidable 
got to go 
  what about my sister 
  well   
as to that  most unfortunate 
no one regrets more than i 
you re the defense against the dark
arts teacher  you can t go now 
i must say  when i took the job 
there was nothing in the description  
you re running away 
  after all you did in your books 
  books can be misleading 
  you wrote them 
  my dear boy  use your common sense 
my books wouldn t have sold as well if
people didn t think i d done those things 
you re a fraud 
you ve been taking credit
for what other wizards have done 
is there anything you can do 
yes  now you mention it 
i m rather gifted with memory charms 
otherwise  all those wizards
would have gone blabbing 
i d never have sold another book 
in fact  i m going to have to do
the same to you 
don t even think about it 
 whimpering 
myrtle 
who s there 
hello  harry 
  what do you want 
  to ask you how you died 
it was dreadful 
it happened right here
in this very cubicle 
i d hidden because olive hornby
was teasing me about my glasses 
i was crying  and then
i heard somebody come in 
  who was it  myrtle 
  i don t know  i was distraught 
but they said something funny 
a kind of made up language 
and i realized it was a boy  so i unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and   
    l died 
  just like that  how 
i just remember seeing a pair
of great  big  yellow eyes   
   over there by that sink 
this is it 
this is it  ron  i think this is
the entrance to the chamber of secrets 
say something  harry 
say something in parseltongue 
 speaks in parseltongue 
excellent  harry  good work 
well  then  i ll just be   
there s no need for me to stay 
harry 
yes  there is 
  you first 
  now  boys  what good will it do 
better you than us 
but   obviously  yes 
sure you don t want to test it first 
 screams 
lockhart 
it s really quite filthy down here 
  all right  let s go 
myrtle  oh  harry 
if you die down there 
you re welcome to share my toilet 
thanks  myrtle 
 screaming 
ron 
ugh 
now  remember  any sign of movement 
close your eyes straightaway 
ron 
go on 
harry 
this way 
ron  what s this 
  it looks like a snake 
harry  it s a snakeskin 
ron  bloody hell 
whatever shed this must be
60 feet long  or more 
heart of a lion  this one 
the adventure ends here  boys 
but don t fret 
the world will know our story 
how i was too late to save the girl 
how you two
tragically lost your minds   
   at the sight of her mangled body 
so   
you first  mr  potter 
say goodbye to your memories 
obliviate 
 rumbling 
harry 
harry 
  ron  ron  are you okay 
  i m fine 
hello 
who are you 
  ron weasley 
  really 
and who am i 
lockhart s memory charm backfired 
he hasn t got a clue who he is 
it s an odd sort of place  isn t it 
do you live here 
  no 
  really 
  what do i do now 
  you wait here   
   and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through 
  i ll go on and find ginny 
ron  okay 
 speaks in parseltongue 
ginny 
ginny  ginny  please don t be dead 
wake up  wake up 
please wake up 
she won t wake 
tom  torn riddle 
what do you mean  she won t wake 
  she s not    
  she s still alive  but only just 
  are you a ghost 
  a memory   
   preserved in a diary for 50 years 
harry  she s cold as ice 
ginny  please don t be dead  wake up 
you ve got to help me  tom 
there s a basilisk 
it won t come until it s called 
  give me my wand  torn 
  you won t be needing it 
  we ve got to go  we ve got to save her 
  i m afraid i can t do that 
you see  as poor ginny grows weaker 
i grow stronger 
yes  harry  it was ginny weasley
who opened the chamber of secrets 
harry 
no  she couldn t  she wouldn t 
riddle  ginny set the basilisk
on the mudbloods and filch s cat   
   ginny wrote the threatening
messages on the walls 
harry  but why 
riddle  because i told her to 
you ll find i can be very persuasive 
not that she knew what she was doing 
she was  shall we say 
in a kind of trance 
still  the power of the diary
began to scare her 
she tried to dispose of it
in the girls  bathroom 
and then who should find it but you 
the very person
i was most anxious to meet 
and why did you want to meet me 
i knew i had to talk to you 
meet you if i could 
so i decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf hagrid   
    to gain your trust 
  hagrid s my friend 
  and you framed him  didn t you 
  it was my word against hagrid s 
only dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent 
i ll bet dumbledore saw
right through you 
he certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that 
i knew it wouldn t be safe to open the
chamber again while i was at school   
   so i decided to leave behind
a diary   
   preserving my 16 year old self
in its pages   
   so that one day
i would be able to lead another   
   to finish salazar slytherin s
noble work 
well  you haven t finished it
this time 
in a few hours  the mandrake draught
will be ready 
and everyone who was petrified
will be all right again 
haven t i told you  killing mudbloods
doesn t matter to me anymore 
for many months now 
my new target has been you 
how is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent   
   was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time 
how did you escape with nothing
but a scar   
   while lord voldemort s powers
were destroyed 
why do you care how i escaped 
voldemort was after your time 
voldemort is my past 
present and future 
you  you re the heir of slytherin 
  you re voldemort 
  surely you didn t think   
   l was going to keep
my filthy muggle father s name 
no  i fashioned myself a new name 
a name i knew wizards everywhere   
   would fear to speak when i became
the greatest sorcerer in the world 
albus dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world 
dumbledore s been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me 
he ll never be gone  not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him 
 bird cries 
fawkes 
so this is what dumbledore
sends his great defender 
a songbird and an old hat 
 speaks in parseltongue 
 rumbling 
let s match the power of lord
voldemort  heir of salazar slytherin   
   against the famous harry potter 
 screeching 
 riddle speaks in parseltongue 
parseltongue won t save you now 
potter  it only obeys me 
 fawkes cries 
riddle 
no 
your bird may have blinded the basilisk 
but it can still hear you 
yes  potter 
the process is nearly complete 
in a few minutes  ginny weasley will be
dead  and i will cease to be a memory 
lord voldemort will return   
   very much alive 
ginny 
riddle 
remarkable  isn t it   
   how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body 
i d guess you have little more
than a minute to live 
you ll be with your dear
mudblood mother soon  harry 
funny  the damage a silly
little book can do   
 especially in the hands
of a silly little girl 
what are you doing 
stop  no 
ginny 
harry 
it was me 
but i swear  i didn t mean to 
riddle made me  and   
harry  you re hurt 
don t worry 
ginny  you need
to get yourself out 
follow the chamber
and you ll find ron 
 fawkes cries 
you were brilliant  fawkes 
i just wasn t quick enough 
of course 
phoenix tears have healing powers 
thanks 
it s all right  ginny 
it s over 
it s just a memory 
amazing 
this is just like magic 
dumbledore 
you both realize  of course   
   that in the past few hours  you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules 
yes  sir 
there is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled 
  yes  sir 
  yes  sir 
therefore  it is only fitting   
   that you both receive   
   special awards for services
to the school 
thanks  sir 
now  mr  weasley  if you would   
   have an owl deliver these
release papers to azkaban 
i believe we want
our gamekeeper back 
harry 
first  i want to thank you  harry 
you must have shown me
real loyalty down in the chamber 
nothing but that
could have called fawkes to you 
and   
  second  
   l sense that something
is troubling you 
am i right  harry 
it s just   
you see  sir  i couldn t help
but notice certain things  certain   
certain similarities
between tom riddle and me 
i see 
well  you can speak
parseltongue  harry  why 
because lord voldemort
can speak parseltongue 
if i m not mistaken  harry   
   he transferred
some of his powers to you   
   the night he gave you that scar 
voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me 
uh huh 
not intentionally   
 but yes 
so the sorting hat was right 
i should be in slytherin 
it s true  you possess many of the
qualities that voldemort himself prizes 
determination  resourcefulness   
   and if i may say so 
a certain disregard for the rules 
why  then  did the sorting hat
place you in gryffindor 
  because i asked it to 
  exactly  harry  exactly 
which makes you different
from voldemort 
it is not our abilities
that show what we truly are 
it is our choices 
if you want proof
why you belong in gryffindor   
   then i suggest
you look more closely at this 
be careful 
godric gryffindor 
it would take a true gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat 
 door opens 
harry 
dobby 
so this is your master 
the family you serve is the malfoys 
 whimpers 
i ll deal with you later 
lucius 
out of my way  potter 
so it s true  you have returned 
when the governors learned that
arthur weasley s daughter   
   was taken into the chamber 
they saw fit to summon me back 
ridiculous 
dumbledore 
curiously  lucius  several of them   
   were under the impression
that you would curse their families   
   if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place 
  how dare you 
  beg your pardon 
my sole concern has always been
and will always be   
   the welfare of this school   
   and  of course  its students 
the culprit has been identified 
i presume 
oh  yes 
and 
who was it 
  voldemort 
  ah 
only this time he chose to act
through somebody else   
   by means of this 
i see 
dumbledore  fortunately 
our young mr  potter discovered it 
one hopes that no more of lord
voldemort s old school things   
   should find their way
into innocent hands 
the consequences for the one
responsible would be   
   severe 
well  let us hope   
   that mr  potter will always
be around to save the day 
don t worry  i will be 
dumbledore 
come  dobby  we re leaving 
 whimpering 
sir 
i wonder if i could have that 
harry 
mr  malfoy 
mr  malfoy 
i have something of yours 
mine  i don t know
what you re talking about 
oh  i think you do  sir 
i think you slipped the diary
into ginny weasley s cauldron   
   that day at diagon alley 
you do  do you 
why don t you prove it 
come  dobby 
open it 
dobby 
master has given dobby a sock 
what  i didn t give  
master has presented dobby
with clothes 
dobby is free 
you lost me my servant 
you shall not harm harry potter 
hm 
your parents were
meddlesome fools too 
mark my words  potter 
one day soon   
   you are going to meet
the same sticky end 
harry potter freed dobby 
how can dobby ever repay him 
  just promise me something 
  anything  sir 
never try to save my life again 
girl 1  welcome back  sir nicholas 
  thank you 
girl 2  good evening  sir nicholas 
  good evening 
boy  good to see you  sir nicholas 
  thank you 
hello 
  hermione  welcome back 
  thanks  sir nicholas 
harry  it s hermione 
uh  um  ahem 
  welcome back  hermione 
 lt s good to be back 
congratulations 
i can t believe you solved it 
we had loads of help from you 
  we couldn t have done it without you 
  thanks 
 tapping on glass 
could i have your attention  please 
before we begin the feast   
   let us have a round of applause
for professor sprout  madam pomfrey   
   whose mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered   
   to all who had been petrified 
also  in light of the recent events   
   as a school treat   
   all exams have been canceled 
oh  no 
sorry i m late 
the owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused 
some ruddy bird called errol 
and i d just like to say that if it hadn t
been for you  harry  and ron   
   and hermione  of course
