mr gilderoy lockhart

mum fancies him
man 2 make way there please
let me by madam thank you
excuse me little girl
this is for the daily prophet
it cant be harry potter
photographer
harry potter
excuse me madam
nice big smile harry
together you and i rate the front page
ladies and gentlemen
what an extraordinary moment this is
when young harry stepped
into flourish and blotts this morning
to purchase my autobiography
magical me
which incidentally
is currently celebrating
its 27th week atop
the daily prophet bestseller list
he had no idea that he would
in fact be leaving
with my entire collected works
free of charge
now ladies
harry now you give me those
and ill get them signed
all of you wait outside
thats it
ill bet you loved that
didnt you potter
famous harry potter cant go into a
bookshop without making the front page
leave him alone
look potter
youve got yourself a girlfriend
now now draco play nicely
mr potter
lucius malfoy we meet at last
forgive me
your scar is legend
as of course is the wizard
who gave it to you
voldemort killed my parents
he was nothing more than a murderer
you must be very brave
to mention his name
or very foolish
fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself
and you must be miss granger
yes draco has told me
all about you and your parents
muggles arent they
let me see
red hair vacant expressions
tatty secondhand book
you must be the weasleys
its mad in here
lets go outside
lucius well weasley senior
lucius
busy time at the ministry arthur
all those extra raids
i do hope theyre paying you overtime
but judging by the state of this
id say not
whats the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard
if they dont even pay you well for it
we have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard malfoy
clearly
associating with muggles
and i thought your family
could sink no lower
ill see you at work
see you at school
mr weasley
1058 come on
mrs weasley
the train will leave soon
fred george percy you first
okay
mr weasley
after you dear
mrs weasley come on ginny
well get you a seat hurry
lets go
what do you two think youre doing
sorry
lost control of the trolley
why cant we get through
i dont know
the gateway has sealed
itself for some reason
the train leaves at exactly 1100
weve missed it
harry if we cant get through
maybe mum and dad cant get back
maybe we should just go
and wait by the car
the car
ron i should tell you
most muggles arent accustomed
to seeing a flying car
right
okay
oh no the invisibility booster
must be faulty
come on then lets go lower
we need to find the train
okay
harry all we need to do
is catch up with the train
we cant be far behind
train whistle blows
do you hear that
we must be getting close
hold on
harry
hold on
take my hand
hold on
im trying your hands all sweaty
i think we found the train
yeah
welcome home
car engine sputters
up up
its not working
up ron mind that tree
stop stop stop
my wand look at my wand
be thankful its not your neck
whats happening
i dont know
harry
come on go fast
scabbers youre okay
the car
dads gonna kill me
harry
see you hedwig
so a houseelf shows up
in my bedroom
we cant get through the barrier
to platform 9 34
we almost get killed by a tree
clearly someone doesnt want me
here this year
well take a good look lads
this night might well be
the last you spend in this castle
oh dear we are in trouble
snape you were seen by no less
than seven muggles
do you have any idea
how serious this is
you have risked
the exposure of our world
not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a whomping willow
thats been on these grounds
since before you were born
honestly professor snape
i think it did more damage to us
silence
i assure you that were you in slytherin
and your fate rested with me
the both of you would be
on the train home tonight
as it is
dumbledore they are not
professor dumbledore
professor mcgonagall
headmaster
these boys have flouted the decree
for the restriction of underage wizardry
as such
i am well aware of our bylaws
having written
quite a few of them myself
however as head of gryffindor house
it is for professor mcgonagall
to determine the appropriate action
well go and get our stuff then
what are you
talking about mr weasley
youre going to expel us arent you
not today mr weasley
but i must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done
i will be writing to your families tonight
and you will both receive detention
morning everyone
good morning everyone
good morning professor sprout
sprout welcome to greenhouse three
second years gather around everyone
today were going to repot mandrakes
who here can tell me
the properties of the mandrake root
yes miss granger
mandrake or mandragora
is used to return those who have been
petrified to their original state
its also dangerous the mandrakes
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it
excellent ten points to gryffindor
as our mandrakes
are still only seedlings
their cries wont kill you yet
but they could knock you out for hours
which is why i have given you earmuffs
for auditory protection
so could you please put them on
right away quickly
flaps tight down
and watch me closely
you grasp your mandrake firmly
you pull it sharply up out of the pot
mandrake screaming
got it and
now you dunk it down
into the other pot
and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm
longbottoms been neglecting
his earmuffs
no maam hes just fainted
yes well just leave him there
right on we go
plenty of pots to go around
grasp your mandrake and pull it up
boy theres nearly headless nick
hello percy miss clearwater
percy
hello sir nicholas
say it im doomed
youre doomed
boy hi harry
im colin creevey im in gryffindor too
hi colin nice to meet you
ron is that your owl
laughing
bloody birds a menace
oh no
look everyone
weasleys got himself a howler
go on ron i ignored one
from my gran once it was horrible
mrs weasleys voice
ronald weasley
how dare you steal that car
i am absolutely disgusted
your fathers now facing
an inquiry at work
and its entirely your fault
if you put another toe out of line
well bring you straight home
and ginny dear congratulations
on making gryffindor
your father and i are so proud
let me introduce you to your new
defense against the dark arts teacher
me
gilderoy lockhart
order of merlin third class
honorary member
of the dark force defense league
and five times winner
of witch weeklys
mostcharmingsmile award
but i dont talk about that
i didnt get rid of the bandon banshee
by smiling at him
now be warned
it is my job to arm you
against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind
you may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room
know only that no harm
can befall you whilst i am here
i must ask you not to scream
it might provoke them
cornish pixies
lockhart
freshly caught cornish pixies
laugh if you will mr finnegan
but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters
lets see what you make of them
come on now round them up
theyre only pixies
pixie you just stay there
neville please get me down
hermione get off me
stop hold still
peskipiksi pesternomi
ill ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage
what do we do now
immobulus
why is it always me
i spent the summer devising
a whole new quidditch program
were gonna train earlier
harder and longer
what i dont believe it
where you think youre going flint
quidditch practice
i booked the pitch for gryffindor today
easy wood ive got a note
uhoh i smell trouble
l professor severus snape
do hereby give the slytherin team
permission to practice today owing
to the need to train their new seeker
youve got a new seeker who
malfoy
thats right
and thats not all
thats new this year
those are nimbus 2001 s
how did you get those
a gift from dracos father
you see weasley unlike some
my father can afford the best
at least no one on the gryffindor team
had to buy their way in
they got in on pure talent
no one asked your opinion
you filthy little mudblood
youll pay for that one malfoy
eat slugs
you okay ron
say something
wow can you turn him around harry
harry no colin get out of the way
lets take him to hagrids
hell know what to do
hagrid this calls for
a specialists equipment
nothing to do but wait till it stops
im afraid
okay
better out than in
who was ron trying to curse anyway
malfoy he called hermione
well i dont know
exactly what it means
he called me a mudblood
he did not
whats a mudblood
it means dirty blood mudbloods a foul
name for someone whos muggleborn
someone with nonmagic parents
someone like me
its not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation
see the thing is harry there are
some wizards like the malfoy family
who think theyre better than everyone
else because theyre pureblood
thats horrible
its disgusting
and its codswallop to boot
dirty blood
why there isnt a wizard alive today
thats not halfblood or less
more to the point theyve yet to think
of a spell that our hermione cant do
come here
dont you think on it hermione
dont you think on it for one minute
aye
lockhart
harry harry harry
can you possibly imagine
a better way to serve detention
than by helping me
to answer my fan mail
not really
fame is a fickle friend harry
celebrity is as celebrity does
remember that
voice
come
come
to me
what
sorry
that voice
voice
didnt you hear it
what are you talking about harry
i think youre getting
a bit drowsy
and great scott no wonder look at the
time weve been here nearly four hours
spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun
spooky
voice
blood
i smell blood
let me rip you
let me kill you
kill
kill
kill
harry
harry did you hear it
hear what
that voice
voice what voice
i heard it first in lockharts office
and then again just
its time
its moving
i think its going to kill
ron kill
hermione harry wait not so fast
strange
ive never seen spiders act like that
i dont like spiders
whats that
hermione the chamber
of secrets has been opened
enemies of the heir beware
its written in blood
oh no
its filchs cat
its mrs norris
enemies of the heir beware
youll be next mudbloods
whats going on here
go on make way make way
potter
what are you
mrs norris
youve murdered my cat
nono
filch
ill kill you
ill kill you
dumbledore argus
argus l
everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately
everyone except
you three
boy
ravenclaws follow me
shes not dead argus
she has been petrified
ah thought so
so unlucky i wasnt there
i know exactly the countercurse
that couldve spared her
but how she has been petrified
l cannot say
ask him
its him thats done it
you saw what he wrote on the wall
its not true sir i swear
i never touched mrs norris
rubbish
if i might headmaster
perhaps potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time
however
the circumstances are suspicious
i for one dont recall
seeing potter at dinner
lockhart
im afraid thats my doing severus
you see harry was helping me
answer my fan mail
hermione thats why ron and i
went looking for him professor
wed just found him when he said
yes miss granger
when i said i wasnt hungry
we were heading back to the common
room when we found mrs norris
innocent until proven guilty severus
filch my cat has been petrified
i want to see some punishment
we will be able to cure her argus
as i understand it madam sprout
has a very healthy growth of mandrake
when matured a potion will be made
which will revive mrs norris
and in the meantime
l strongly recommend caution
to all
hermione its a bit strange isnt it
strange
hermione you hear this voice
a voice only you can hear
and then mrs norris turns up
petrified its just strange
do you think i should have told them
dumbledore and the others i mean
are you mad
no harry even in the wizarding world
hearing voices isnt a good sign
man in picture
shes right you know
mcgonagall could i have
your attention please
right now today
we will be transforming animals
into water goblets
like so
one two three
vera verto
now its your turn
who would like to go first
mr weasley
one two three vera verto
vera verto
mcgonagall that wand needs
replacing mr weasley
yes miss granger
professor
l was wondering if you could tell us
about the chamber of secrets
very well
you all know of course
that hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago
by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age
godric gryffindor
helga hufflepuff
rowena ravenclaw
and salazar slytherin
now three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously
one did not
three guesses who
salazar slytherin wished to be
more selective
about the students admitted
to hogwarts
he believed magical learning should
be kept within allmagic families
in other words purebloods
unable to sway the others
he decided to leave the school
now according to legend
slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle
known as the chamber of secrets
though shortly before departing
he sealed it
until that time when his own
true heir returned to the school
the heir alone
would be able to open the chamber
and unleash the horror within
and by so doing
purge the school
of all those who
in slytherins view
were unworthy to study magic
muggleborns
naturally the school
has been searched many times
no such chamber has been found
professor what exactly does legend
tell us lies within the chamber
the chamber is said to be home
to something
that only the heir of slytherin
can control
it is said to be the home
of a monster
do you think its true do you think
there really is a chamber of secrets
yes couldnt you tell mcgonagalls
worried all the teachers are
if there really is a chamber of secrets
and it has been opened that means
the heir of slytherin has returned
to hogwarts the question is who is it
lets think who do we know who
thinks all muggleborns are scum
if youre talking about malfoy
of course you heard him
youll be next mudbloods
i heard him
but malfoy the heir of slytherin
maybe rons right hermione
i mean look at his family
the whole lot of them have been
in slytherin for centuries
crabbe and goyle must know
maybe we could trick them into telling
even they arent that thick
but there might be another way
mind you it would be difficult
not to mention wed be breaking
about 50 school rules
and itll be dangerous
very dangerous
hermione
here it is the polyjuice potion
properly brewed the polyjuice potion
allows the drinker
to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another
you mean if harry and i drink that stuff
well turn into crabbe and goyle
wicked malfoy will tell us anything
exactly
but its tricky ive never seen
a more complicated potion
harry how long will it take to make
a month
a month
but hermione
if malfoy is the heir of slytherin
he could attack half
the muggleborns in the school by then
i know
but its the only plan weve got
bell rings
another goal for slytherin
they lead gryffindor 90 to 30
yeah
yeah
all right there scarhead
watch yourself harry
harry
wood look out
blimey harrys got himself
a rogue bludger
thats been tampered with that has
ill stop it
no even with a proper wand
its too risky you could hit harry
training for the ballet potter
youll never catch me potter
lets go
lee harry potter has caught
the snitch gryffindor wins
finite lncantatem
thank you
hermione are you okay
no i think my arm is broken
not to worry i will fix
that arm of yours straightaway
no not you
boy doesnt know what hes saying
this wont hurt a bit
brackium emendo
yes well
that can sometimes happen
but the point is
you can no longer feel any pain and
very clearly the bones are not broken
broken theres no bones left
lockhart
much more flexible though
groans
mr malfoy stop making such a fuss
you can go out of my way
should have been brought
straight to me
i can mend bones in a heartbeat
but growing them back
you will be able to wont you
ill be able to certainly
but itll be painful
youre in for a rough night potter
regrowing bones is a nasty business
what do you expect
pumpkin juice
voice
kill
kill
time to kill
hello
dobby
harry potter should have listened
to dobby
harry potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train
it was you you stopped the barrier
from letting ron and me through
indeed yes sir
you nearly got ron and me expelled
at least you would be away from here
harry potter must go home
dobby thought his bludger would be
enough to make harry potter see
your bludger you made
that bludger chase after me
dobby feels most aggrieved sir
dobby had to iron his hands
you better clear off before my bones
come back or i might strangle you
dobby is used to death threats sir
dobby gets them five times a day
at home
i dont suppose you could tell me
why youre trying to kill me
not kill you sir
never kill you
dobby remembers how it was
before harry potter triumphed
over hewhomustnotbenamed
we houseelves were
treated like vermin sir
of course dobby is still
treated like vermin
sobs
why do you wear that thing dobby
this sir it is a mark
of the houseelfs enslavement
dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes
rattling
listen
listen
terrible things are
about to happen at hogwarts
harry potter must not stay here
now that history
is to repeat itself
repeat itself you mean
this has happened before
i shouldnt have said that
bad dobby bad
stop it
stop it dobby
tell me when did this happen before
whos doing it now
dobby cannot say sir dobby
only wants harry potter to be safe
no dobby tell me
who is it
door opens
pom frey
put him here
what happened
dumbledore
theres been another attack
i think hes been petrified
madam pomfrey
look perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker
mcgonagall
what can this mean albus
it means
that our students
are in great danger
what should i tell the staff
dumbledore the truth
tell them hogwarts
is no longer safe
it is as we feared minerva
the chamber of secrets
has indeed been opened again
hermione you mean the chamber
of secrets has been opened before
of course
dont you see
lucius malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here
now hes taught draco how to do it
maybe
well have to wait for
the polyjuice potion to know for sure
enlighten me why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight
in the middle of the girls lavatory
dont you think well get caught
no no one ever comes in here
why
moaning myrtle
who
moaning myrtle
whos moaning myrtle
im moaning myrtle
i wouldnt expect you to know me
who would ever talk
about ugly miserable
moping moaning myrtle
screams
shes a little sensitive
lockhart
gather round
gather round
can everybody see me
can you all hear me
excellent
in light of the dark events
of recent weeks
professor dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this dueling club
to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves
as i myself have done
on countless occasions
for full details
see my published works
let me introduce my assistant
professor snape
he has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration
i dont want any of you
youngsters to worry
youll still have your potions master
when im through with him never fear
one
two
three
expelliarmus
do you think hes all right
who cares
an excellent idea to show them that
professor snape
but if you dont mind me saying it was
obvious what you were about to do
if i had wanted to stop you
it would have been only too easy
perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students
to block unfriendly spells
professor
an excellent suggestion
professor snape
lets have a volunteer pair
potter weasley how about you
snape weasleys wand causes
devastation with the simplest spells
well be sending potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox
might i suggest someone
from my own house
malfoy perhaps
lockhart good luck potter
thank you sir
lockhart
wands at the ready
scared potter
you wish
lockhart
on the count of three
cast your charms to disarm
your opponent only to disarm
we dont want any accidents here
one
two
everte statum
rictusempra
students laughing
i said disarm only
serpensortia
dont move potter
ill get rid of it for you
allow me professor snape
alarte ascendare
speaking foreign language
vipera evanesca
what are you playing at
youre a parselmouth
why didnt you tell us
im a what
you can talk to snakes
i know i accidentally set a python
on my cousin dudley at the zoo once
once but so what
i bet loads of people here can do it
no they cant
its not a very common gift harry
this is bad
whats bad if i hadnt told
that snake not to attack justin
thats what you said to it
you were there you heard me
i heard you speaking parseltongue
snake language
i spoke a different language
but i didnt realize
how can i speak a language
without knowing i can
i dont know but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something
harry listen to me
theres a reason the symbol
of slytherin house is a serpent
salazar slytherin was a parselmouth
he could talk to snakes too

youre his greatgreatgreat grandson
but im not

their tears have healing powers
door opens
professor dumbledore sir

i do not think it was you
but i must ask you
is there something
you wish to tell me
no sir

very well then
off you go
everythings set we just need a bit
of who youre changing into
crabbe and goyle
we also need to make sure
that the real crabbe and goyle
cant burst in on us
while were interrogating malfoy
how
ive got it all worked out
i filled these
with a simple sleeping draught
simple but powerful
now once theyre asleep
hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs
and put on their uniforms
whose hair are you ripping out then
ive already got mine
millicent bulstrode slytherin
i got this off her robes
im going to go check
on the polyjuice potion
make sure that crabbe and goyle
find these
clears throat
ron maybe i should do it
yeah right
wingardium leviosa

hermione well have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves
add the hairs
ugh essence of crabbe
hermione

groans
harry
ron
bloody hell
we still sound like ourselves
you need to sound more like crabbe
bloody hell
excellent
but wheres hermione
hermione l
i dont think im going
you go on without me
hermione are you okay
hermione
just go youre wasting time
come on
the slytherin common rooms this way
okay
percy
excuse me
what are you doing d
i mean what are you doing down here
i happen to be a school prefect
you on the other hand have no business
wandering the corridors at night
what are your names again
im
crabbe goyle where have you been
pigging out in the great hall
all this time
why are you wearing glasses
reading
reading
i didnt know you could read
and what are you doing down here
weasley
mind your attitude malfoy
well sit down
youd never know the weasleys
were purebloods the way they behave
theyre an embarrassment
to the wizarding world all of them
whats wrong with you crabbe
stomachache
im surprised the daily prophet
hasnt done a report on all these attacks
i suppose dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up
father always said dumbledore
was the worst thing
that ever happened to this place
youre wrong
what
you think theres someone here
whos worse than dumbledore
well do you
harry potter
good one goyle
youre absolutely right
saint potter
and people actually think
that hes the heir of slytherin
but then you must have some idea
whos behind it all
you know i dont goyle
i told you yesterday
how many times do i have to tell you
is this yours
but my father did say this
its been 50 years
since the chamber was opened
he wouldnt tell me who opened it
only that they were expelled
the last time the chamber of secrets
was opened a mudblood died
so its only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time
as for me
l hope its granger
whats the matter with you two
youre acting very odd
its his stomachache
calm down
scar
hair
hey where are you going
that was close
hermione come out
weve got loads to tell you
hermione
go away
wait till you see its awful
hermione

hermione
do you remember me telling you
that the polyjuice potion
was only for human transformations
it was cat hair i plucked off
millicent bulstrodes robes
look at my face
look at your tail
ron

ron

harry looks like moaning myrtles
flooded the bathroom
myrtle whimpering
come to throw something else at me
why would i throw something at you
dont ask me here i am
minding my own business
and someone thinks its funny
to throw a book at me
but it cant hurt if someone
throws something at you
i mean itll just go
right through you
sure lets all throw books at myrtle
because she cant feel it
ten points
if you get it through her stomach
fifty points if it goes through her head
but who threw it at you anyway
i dont know i didnt see them
i was just sitting in the ubend
thinking about death
and it fell through the top
of my head uhhuh

albus look
hagrids record is against him
ive got to take him
hagrid take me

im afraid we have no choice hagrid
already here fudge
good
what are you doing here
get out of my house
lucius
believe me
l take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your
you call this a house
no
i simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here
well what exactly is it
that you want with me
the other governors and i have decided
its time for you to step aside
this is an order of suspension
youll find all 12 signatures on it
im afraid we feel
youve rather lost your touch
well what with all these attacks
therell be no
muggleborns left at hogwarts
i can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school
hagrid you cant take
professor dumbledore away
take him away and the muggleborns
wont stand a chance
you mark my words
therell be killings next
you think so
dumbledore
calm yourself hagrid
if the governors desire my removal
l will of course step aside
however
you will find that help
will always be given at hogwarts
to those who
ask for it
admirable sentiments
shall we
fudge
come hagrid
well
hagrid
if
if anybody was looking for some stuff
then all theyd have to do
would be to follow the spiders
yep that would lead them right
thats all i have to say
oh and someone will need
to feed fang while im away
fudge
good boy
hagrids right
with dumbledore gone
therell be an attack a day
look

theyre heading to the dark forest
why spiders why couldnt it be
follow the butterflies
rumbling
ron
harry i dont like this
harry i dont like this at all
shush
can we go back now
come on
aragog
who is it
dont panic
aragog
hagrid
is that you
were friends of hagrids
and you
youre aragog arent you
aragog
yes
hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before
hes in trouble up at the school
there have been attacks
they think its hagrid
they think he opened
the chamber of secrets like before
aragog
thats a lie
hagrid never opened
the chamber of secrets
then youre not the monster
aragog no
the monster was born in the castle
i came to hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler
harry
shush
but if youre not the monster then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago
aragog
we do not speak of it
it is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others
but have you seen it
aragog i never saw any part of the
castle but the box in which i was kept
the girl was discovered
in a bathroom
when i was accused
hagrid brought me here
harry
what
well thank you
well just go
aragog
go
i think not
my sons and daughters
do not harm hagrid on my command
but i cannot deny them
fresh meat
when it wanders
so willingly into our midst
goodbye friend of hagrid
can we panic now
know any spells
one but its not powerful
enough for all of them
wheres hermione when you need her
car eng i ne roars
lets go
harry
arania exumai

arania exumai
thanks for that

get us in the air
the flying gears jammed
harry come on pull
im trying
fang barking
follow the spiders
follow the spiders
if hagrid ever gets out of azkaban
ill kill him
car starts
i mean what was the point
of sending us in there
what have we found out
we know one thing
hagrid never opened
the chamber of secrets
he was innocent
wish you were here hermione
we need you
now more than ever
whats that
ron
this is why hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked
come on
of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land
none is more deadly than the basilisk
capable of living for hundreds of years
instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpents eye
spiders flee before it
ron this is it
the monster in the
chamber of secrets is a basilisk
thats why i can hear it speak
its a snake
but if it kills by looking people
in the eye why is it no ones dead
because no one did look it
in the eye
not directly at least
colin saw it through his camera
justin justin must have seen the
basilisk through nearly headless nick
nick got the full blast of it
but hes a ghost he couldnt die again
and hermione had the mirror
i bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along
and mrs norris
im pretty sure she didnt have
a camera or a mirror harry
the water
there was water on the floor that night
she only saw the basilisks reflection
spiders flee before it
it all fits
hows the basilisk been getting around
a dirty great snake
someone would have seen it
harry hermiones answered that too
pipes its using the plumbing
remember what aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago
she died in a bathroom
what if she never left
moaning myrtle
mcgonagall all students are to
return to their dormitories at once
all teachers to the secondfloor
corridor immediately
as you can see the heir of slytherin
has left another message
our worst fear has been realized
a student has been taken by the monster
into the chamber itself
the students must be sent home
im afraid this is the end of hogwarts
so sorry dozed off
what have i missed
a girl has been snatched by the monster
lockhart your moment has come at last
my moment
werent you saying just last night
that youve known all along where the
entrance to the chamber of secrets is
thats settled well leave you
to deal with the monster gilderoy
your skills after all are legend
very well
ill just be in my office getting
getting ready
who is it that the monsters taken
minerva
ginny weasley
ron her skeleton will lie
in the chamber forever
ginny
harry lockharts useless but hes
going to try and get into the chamber
at least we can tell him
what we know
professor we have some information
for you
are you going somewhere
well yes urgent call unavoidable
got to go
what about my sister
well
as to that most unfortunate
no one regrets more than i
youre the defense against the dark
arts teacher you cant go now
i must say when i took the job
there was nothing in the description
youre running away
after all you did in your books
books can be misleading
you wrote them
my dear boy use your common sense
my books wouldnt have sold as well if
people didnt think id done those things
youre a fraud
youve been taking credit
for what other wizards have done
is there anything you can do
yes now you mention it
im rather gifted with memory charms
otherwise all those wizards
would have gone blabbing
id never have sold another book
in fact im going to have to do
the same to you
dont even think about it
whimpering
myrtle
whos there
hello harry
what do you want
to ask you how you died
it was dreadful
it happened right here
in this very cubicle
id hidden because olive hornby
was teasing me about my glasses
i was crying and then
i heard somebody come in
who was it myrtle
i dont know i was distraught
but they said something funny
a kind of madeup language
and i realized it was a boy so i unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and
l died
just like that how
i just remember seeing a pair
of great big yellow eyes
over there by that sink
this is it
this is it ron i think this is
the entrance to the chamber of secrets
say something harry
say something in parseltongue
speaks in parseltongue
excellent harry good work
well then ill just be
theres no need for me to stay
harry
yes there is
you first
now boys what good will it do
better you than us
but obviously yes
sure you dont want to test it first
screams
lockhart
its really quite filthy down here
all right lets go
myrtle oh harry
if you die down there
youre welcome to share my toilet
thanks myrtle
screaming
ron
ugh
now remember any sign of movement
close your eyes straightaway
ron
go on
harry
this way
ron whats this
it looks like a snake
harry its a snakeskin
ron bloody hell
whatever shed this must be
60 feet long or more
heart of a lion this one
the adventure ends here boys
but dont fret
the world will know our story
how i was too late to save the girl
how you two
tragically lost your minds
at the sight of her mangled body
so
you first mr potter
say goodbye to your memories
obliviate
rumbling
harry
harry
ron ron are you okay
im fine
hello
who are you
ron weasley
really
and who am i
lockharts memory charm backfired
he hasnt got a clue who he is
its an odd sort of place isnt it
do you live here
no
really
what do i do now
you wait here
and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through
ill go on and find ginny
ron okay
speaks in parseltongue
ginny
ginny ginny please dont be dead
wake up wake up
please wake up
she wont wake
tom torn riddle
what do you mean she wont wake
shes not
shes still alive but only just
are you a ghost
a memory
preserved in a diary for 50 years
harry shes cold as ice
ginny please dont be dead wake up
youve got to help me tom
theres a basilisk
it wont come until its called
give me my wand torn
you wont be needing it
weve got to go weve got to save her
im afraid i cant do that
you see as poor ginny grows weaker
i grow stronger
yes harry it was ginny weasley
who opened the chamber of secrets
harry
no she couldnt she wouldnt
riddle ginny set the basilisk
on the mudbloods and filchs cat
ginny wrote the threatening
messages on the walls
harry but why
riddle because i told her to
youll find i can be very persuasive
not that she knew what she was doing
she was shall we say
in a kind of trance
still the power of the diary
began to scare her
she tried to dispose of it
in the girls bathroom
and then who should find it but you
the very person
i was most anxious to meet
and why did you want to meet me
i knew i had to talk to you
meet you if i could
so i decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf hagrid
to gain your trust
hagrids my friend
and you framed him didnt you
it was my word against hagrids
only dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent
ill bet dumbledore saw
right through you
he certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that
i knew it wouldnt be safe to open the
chamber again while i was at school
so i decided to leave behind
a diary
preserving my 16yearold self
in its pages
so that one day
i would be able to lead another
to finish salazar slytherins
noble work
well you havent finished it
this time
in a few hours the mandrake draught
will be ready
and everyone who was petrified
will be all right again
havent i told you killing mudbloods
doesnt matter to me anymore
for many months now
my new target has been you
how is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent
was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time
how did you escape with nothing
but a scar
while lord voldemorts powers
were destroyed
why do you care how i escaped
voldemort was after your time
voldemort is my past
present and future
you youre the heir of slytherin
youre voldemort
surely you didnt think
l was going to keep
my filthy muggle fathers name
no i fashioned myself a new name
a name i knew wizards everywhere
would fear to speak when i became
the greatest sorcerer in the world
albus dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world
dumbledores been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me
hell never be gone not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him
bird cries
fawkes
so this is what dumbledore
sends his great defender
a songbird and an old hat
speaks in parseltongue
rumbling
lets match the power of lord
voldemort heir of salazar slytherin
against the famous harry potter
screeching
riddle speaks in parseltongue
parseltongue wont save you now
potter it only obeys me
fawkes cries
riddle
no
your bird may have blinded the basilisk
but it can still hear you
yes potter
the process is nearly complete
in a few minutes ginny weasley will be
dead and i will cease to be a memory
lord voldemort will return
very much alive
ginny
riddle
remarkable isnt it
how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body
id guess you have little more
than a minute to live
youll be with your dear
mudblood mother soon harry
funny the damage a silly
little book can do
especially in the hands
of a silly little girl
what are you doing
stop no
ginny
harry
it was me
but i swear i didnt mean to
riddle made me and
harry youre hurt
dont worry
ginny you need
to get yourself out
follow the chamber
and youll find ron
fawkes cries
you were brilliant fawkes
i just wasnt quick enough
of course
phoenix tears have healing powers
thanks
its all right ginny
its over
its just a memory
amazing
this is just like magic
dumbledore
you both realize of course
that in the past few hours you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules
yes sir
there is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled
yes sir
yes sir
therefore it is only fitting
that you both receive
special awards for services
to the school
thanks sir
now mr weasley if you would
have an owl deliver these
release papers to azkaban
i believe we want
our gamekeeper back
harry
first i want to thank you harry
you must have shown me
real loyalty down in the chamber
nothing but that
could have called fawkes to you
and
second
l sense that something
is troubling you
am i right harry
its just
you see sir i couldnt help
but notice certain things certain
certain similarities
between tom riddle and me
i see
well you can speak
parseltongue harry why
because lord voldemort
can speak parseltongue
if im not mistaken harry
he transferred
some of his powers to you
the night he gave you that scar
voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me
uhhuh
not intentionally
but yes
so the sorting hat was right
i should be in slytherin
its true you possess many of the
qualities that voldemort himself prizes
determination resourcefulness
and if i may say so
a certain disregard for the rules
why then did the sorting hat
place you in gryffindor
because i asked it to
exactly harry exactly
which makes you different
from voldemort
it is not our abilities
that show what we truly are
it is our choices
if you want proof
why you belong in gryffindor
then i suggest
you look more closely at this
be careful
godric gryffindor
it would take a true gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat
door opens
harry
dobby
so this is your master
the family you serve is the malfoys
whimpers
ill deal with you later
lucius
out of my way potter
so its true you have returned
when the governors learned that
arthur weasleys daughter
was taken into the chamber
they saw fit to summon me back
ridiculous
dumbledore
curiously lucius several of them
were under the impression
that you would curse their families
if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place
how dare you
beg your pardon
my sole concern has always been
and will always be
the welfare of this school
and of course its students
the culprit has been identified
i presume
oh yes
and
who was it
voldemort
ah
only this time he chose to act
through somebody else
by means of this
i see
dumbledore fortunately
our young mr potter discovered it
one hopes that no more of lord
voldemorts old schoolthings
should find their way
into innocent hands
the consequences for the one
responsible would be
severe
well let us hope
that mr potter will always
be around to save the day
dont worry i will be
dumbledore
come dobby were leaving
whimpering
sir
i wonder if i could have that
harry
mr malfoy
mr malfoy
i have something of yours
mine i dont know
what youre talking about
oh i think you do sir
i think you slipped the diary
into ginny weasleys cauldron
that day at diagon alley
you do do you
why dont you prove it
come dobby
open it
dobby
master has given dobby a sock
what i didnt give
master has presented dobby
with clothes
dobby is free
you lost me my servant
you shall not harm harry potter
hm
your parents were
meddlesome fools too
mark my words potter
one day soon
you are going to meet
the same sticky end
harry potter freed dobby
how can dobby ever repay him
just promise me something
anything sir
never try to save my life again
girl 1 welcome back sir nicholas
thank you
girl 2 good evening sir nicholas
good evening

we couldnt have done it without you
thanks
tapping on glass
could i have your attention please
before we begin the feast
let us have a round of applause
for professor sprout madam pomfrey
whose mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered
to all who had been petrified
also in light of the recent events
as a school treat
all exams have been canceled
oh no
sorry im late
the owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused
some ruddy bird called errol
