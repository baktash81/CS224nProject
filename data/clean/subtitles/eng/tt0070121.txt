  let s go 
  look at this

leaving so soon 
wake me at 6   
   for tea and biscuits 
make that noon 
who is it 
i said noon 
come here  come here 
oh  boy  look 
here  see if it fits 
now  do not suppose that i have come
to abolish the law and the prophets 
i did not come to abolish   
   but to complete 
i tell you this  
so long as heaven
and earth endure   
   not a letter   
   not a stroke will disappear
from the law   
   until all that must happen
has happened 
if any man  therefore   
   sets aside even the least
of the law s demands   
   he will have the lowest place   
   in the kingdom of heaven 
but he who keeps the law   
   and teaches others so   
   he will have the highest place
in the kingdom of heaven 
unless you show yourselves to be
far better than the pharisees   
   and the doctors of the law   
   you shall never enter
the kingdom of heaven 
amen 
brothers and sisters
gather around   
   because two men   
   i said two  went off to
the temple to pray 
one  a pharisee   
   and the other   
   a tax gatherer 
while the pharisee  he just stood
right on up and prayed thus 
i thank thee  o god 
that i am not like other men 
greedy  dishonest  adulterous   
   or for that matter 
like that tax gatherer 
i pray twice a week 
get that  twice a week 
and pay taxes on all that i get 
but the other kept his distance   
   and would not even raise his eyes
to the good lord in heaven 
  i said   the good lord in heaven  
  amen 
but beat upon his breast  saying  
 oh  god  have mercy on me   
   sinner that i am  
and it was this man  i tell you  
you ve got to be kidding 
and not the other  who went off
and quitted of his sins 
for every man who exalts himself   
   shall be humbled 
but every man who humbles himself   
shall be   
   exalted 
what if your brother sues you 
you better settle with him quickly 
  or he ll hand you over to the judge 
  guilty 
and the judge to the constable   
   and you ll land in jail 
let me out of here 
i tell you   
   you ll not get out of there
until you ve paid the last penny 
there once was a king
who decided to settle accounts
with the men who served him
at the outset
there appeared before the master
a man whose debt
ran into the millions
i said the millions
since the man had no means of paying
the master ordered him to be sold
to meet the debt
with his wife
and his child
and everything he had
the man threw himself
down at the master s feet and went 
  be patient with me 
  he said 
and i shall pay in full 
and so moved with pity
was the master   
   that he decided to free the man   
   and remit the debt 
and let s hear it for the master 
give me an m 
give me an a s t e r 
yay  master 
wait a minute 
no sooner had he been released   
   that he met a servant
who owed him a few dollars 
he gripped him by
the throat and said  
pay me  i says pay me
what you owes me 
the man fell at his fellow servant s
feet and begged him  saying 
please  please be patient with me 
i shall pay you 
but he refused  saying  
look 
and had him jailed
until he should pay 
well  the other servants
were deeply distressed   
   when they saw what had happened 
are you sitting down 
they ran and told their master
the whole story 
accordingly  he sent for the man 
you scoundrel 
he said to him 
i remitted the whole of your debt
when you appealed to me 
were you not bound to show your fellow
servant the same pity i show to you 
and so angry was the master   
   that he condemned the man
to torture   
   until he could pay   
   the debt in full 
and that is how my heavenly father
will deal with you   
   unless you forgive your brothers
from your hearts 
master

you have heard   an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth  
but what i tell you is this  
never set yourself against
the man who wrongs you 
so if someone slaps you
on your right cheek   
   turn and offer him your left 
oh  jesus chr  
slowly i turn   
   step by step   
   inch by inch 
it s for you 
no  i didn t think so 
now  when the son of man
comes in all his glory   
   with all his angels with him   
   he will sit in state
upon his throne   
   with all the nations
gathered before him 
he ll separate the men
into two groups   
   as a shepherd separates
the sheep from the goats 
he ll put the sheep on his right   
   and the goats on his left 
over there 
sheep on his right 
the sheep on his right  i see 
thank you 
and then he will say
to those on his right 
sheep   
    you have my father s blessing 
  oh  wonderful 
enter the kingdom that s been
ready since the world was made 
for when i was hungry 
you gave me food 
when i was thirsty 
you gave me drink 
when i was naked and without a home 
you took me in 
and when i was ill and in prison 
you came to my aid 
sorry 
no goats 
baloney 
then they will say to him  
master  when was it that we saw
youse hungry and gave youse food   
   or thirsty and gave youse drink 
yeah 
or in prison and helped you 
and he will say to them  
 anything you did
for one of your brothers   
   however humble  you did for me  
i get it 
and he will say to them  
a curse is upon you 
then they ll say to him  
big boy  if we d have
known it was you   
   we would ve taken you around
the corner for a cup of coffee 
and he will say to them  
 anything you did not do for one of
your brothers  however humble   
   you did not do for me  
and then they will take their place
in eternal punishment 
but the righteous
shall have eternal life 
come on 
come on 
the lamp   
   of the body   
   is the eye 
if your eye   
   is sound   
   your whole   
   body   
   will be filled   
   with light 
but   
   if your eye   
   is bad   
   your whole   
   body   
   will be darkness 
if then   
   the only   
   light   
   you have   
   is darkness   
   the darkness will be doubly dark 
hey  i can t see 
  what s the matter 
  i got my eyes shut 
now  no servant can be
the slave of two masters 
either he will love the first
and think nothing of the second   
   or be devoted to the second
and hate the first 
no man can serve god   
   and money

a man was on his way
from jerusalem to jericho   
   when he fell among robbers   
   who beat him   
   stripped him   
   and left   
   leaving him half dead 
it so happened
a priest came upon him 
but when he saw him 
he went past on the other side 
so too  a judge   
   came to the place   
   and saw him   
   and he went past
on the other side 
but   
   a samaritan was making the journey 
he came upon him 
and when he saw him   
   he was moved to pity 
he went up and bandaged his wounds   
   bathing them in oil and wine 
then he put him onto his own beast
and brought him to an inn   
   and looked after him there 
the next day  he produced
two pieces of silver   
   and gave them to the innkeeper
and said 
 look after him   
   and if you spend any more   
   i will repay on my way back  
bravo 
when you do some act of charity 
don t announce it with trumpets   
   as the heathen do in synagogues
and in the streets 
i tell you  they do it
just to win admiration from men 
no  when you do
some act of charity   
   don t let your right hand know   
   what your left hand is doing 
look at that 
your good deed must be in secret 
it s a secret 
what the good master is telling us
is that up in heaven   
   there s about 100 million
tiny angels about yea by yea   
   and they all take shorthand 
every time you do something silly 
they write it in  
that s not what the good master
is telling us 
your heavenly father 
who sees what is done in secret   
he will what 
reward you 
get him some flowers 
thank you 
thank you 
there once was
a very rich man   
   who dressed in purple
and the finest linen 
rich man  that s me 
and every day he feasted  
thank you  thank you   
feasted in the greatest magnificence 
at his gate lay poor lazarus   
   who would ve been glad to eat
the scraps from the rich man s table 
oh  my god  it s good 
get out of there 
even the doggy doggies   
   used to come to lazarus
and lick his open  running sores 
sorry 
well  one day 
the poor man died   
   and was carried away
by the angels to be with abraham 
the rich man also died   
   and was buried   
   and was sent to hades   
   where he was in torment 
he looked up   
   and there  far  far away   
   was abraham   
   with lazarus close beside him 
oh  father abraham   
   have pity on me 
send lazarus to dip   
   the tip of his finger
in water to cool my tongue 
for i m in agony in this fire 
let go of me  will you 
remember  my child  that
all the good things fell to you   
   while you were on earth 
and all the bad to lois 
lazarus 
abraham 
glad to know you 
and now it is he
who has consolation here   
   and it is you who are in agony 
then  father abraham  send lazarus
to my father s house   
   where i have five pies  
i mean  brothers   
   to warn them   
   so that they too may not come
to this place of torment 
they got moses and the prophets 
let them listen to them 
but if somebody from the dead
should rise  then they d listen 
look 
if they don t listen
to moses and the prophets   
   they ain t gonna
listen to nobody 
even if somebody should
rise from the dead 
oh  bless the lord  my soul
his grace to thee proclaim
and all that is within rejoin
to bless his holy name
oh  bless the lord  my soul
his mercies bear in mind
forget not all his benefits
the lord to thee is kind
he will not always chide
he will with patience wait
his wrath is ever slow to rise
and ready to abate
and ready to abate
and ready to
and ready to abate
he pardons all thy sins
prolongs thy feeble breath
he healeth thine infirmities
and ransoms thee from death
oh  bless the lord  my soul
he clothes thee with his love
upholds thee with his truth
and like the eagle he renews
the vigor of thy youth
then bless his holy name
whose grace has made thee whole
whose loving kindness crown
thy days
bless the lord  my soul
bless the lord  my soul
oh  bless the lord
my soul
oh  bless the lord  my soul
bravo

   when men shall persecute you
and revile you   
   and say all manner
of evil against you   
   falsely

come on 
when   
   you   
   feel   
   sad
or under a curse
your life is bad
your prospects are worse
your wife is sighing
crying
and your olive tree is dying
temples are graying
teeth are decaying
and creditors weighing your purse
your mood
and your robe
are both a deep blue

don t forget that
when you get
into heaven you ll be blessed
yes  it s all for the best
some men live at ease
doing what they please
richer than the bees are in honey
never growing old
never feeling cold
pulling pots of gold from thin air
the best in every town
best at shaking down
best at making mountains of money
they can t take it with them
but what do they care 
they get the center of the meat
cushions on their seat
houses on the street
where it s sunny
summers at the sea
winters warm and free
all of this
and we get the rest
but who is the land for 
the sun and the sand for 
you guessed
it s all for the best
thanks 
when you feel sad
or under a curse
your life is bad
your prospects are worse
your wife is sighing  crying

are both a deep blue

how can you take the speck of sawdust
out of your brother s eye

come on 
right here 
a sower went to sow some seed 
as he sowed  some seed
fell on the footpath   
   where it was trampled on 
and the birds ate it up 
some seed fell on rock 
and after coming up  
grow  grow  grow 
grow  grow  grow 
  withered for lack of moisture 
and some seed fell
in among the weeds 
and the weeds grew up with it   
   and choked it 
and some seed fell into good soil 
good soil 
come on 
it grew and it yielded
a hundredfold 
do you know what the seed is 
  a baby 
  wrong 
the seed is the word of god 
and that seed which fell
along the footpath   
   represents those
who hear the word   
   but then the devil comes
and carries them off   
   for fear they should believe
and be saved 
and that which fell upon rock   
   they receive the word with joy 
but they have no root 
so in time of testing  they desert 
  bye 
  see you 
and that which fell among weeds   
   hear the word  but their
growth is impaired by wealth   
   and cares and the pleasures
of the world 
they bring nothing to fruit 
no fruit  robin 
but that which fell
among good soil   
hey  good soil 
they hear the word with
a good and honest heart   
   and through their perseverance   
   yield a harvest 
we plow the fields and scatter
the good seed on the land
but it is fed and watered
by god s almighty hand
he sends the snow in winter
the warmth to swell the grain
the breezes and the sunshine
and soft refreshing rain
all good gifts around us
are sent from heaven above
so thank the lord
oh  thank the lord
for all his love
consider the lilies of the field 
they don t work 
they don t spin 
and yet  i tell you 
solomon in all his splendor   
   was not attired
like one of these 
now  if that s how god clothes
the grass which is here today   
   and tomorrow is thrown
unto the fire   
   will he not all the more
clothe you 
we thank thee then  o father
for all things bright and good
the seed time and the harvest
our life  our health  our food
no gifts have we to offer
for all thy love imparts
but that which thou desirest
our humble thankful hearts
all good gifts around us
are sent from heaven above
so thank the lord
oh  thank the lord
for all his love
i really want to thank you  lord
all good gifts around us
are sent from heaven above
all good gifts around us
just thank you  lord
once upon a time  there was a man
who had two sons 
and the younger son
said to his father 
father  give me
my share of the property 
so he divided his estate
between them 
a few days later  the younger son   
   turned the whole of his share
into cash 
and left home
for a distant country 
where i squandered the money
on reckless living 
he d spent it all when
a famine fell upon the country   
   and he began to feel the pinch 
so he decided to attach himself
to one of the local landowners   
   who sent him on the farm
to mind the pigs 
he would ve been glad
to have filled his belly   
   with the pods
the pigs were eating   
   but no one gave him anything 
and then he came to his senses 
he said  
how many of my father s servants
have more food than they can eat   
   and here i am starving to death 
i will set off and i will go to
my father s house and say to him  
 father  i have sinned against god
and against you 
i am no longer fit
to be called your son 
treat me as one of
your paid servants  
so he set out for
his father s house 
yes  and there he goes 
while he was still a long way off   
   his father saw him 
and his heart went out to him 
the son ran to meet his father   
   and like the spunky kid he is   
   threw his arms around him 
kissed him and said 
father  i have sinned against god
and against you 
i am no longer fit
to be called your son 
treat me as one of
your paid servants 
but the father called
to one of his servants  
servant 
quick  fetch me my robe 
my best one 
put rings on his fingers
and bells on his toes   
   so he shall have music
wherever he goes 
wrong story 
put rings on his fingers
and shoes on his feet   
   and bring the fatted calf
and kill it 
i said kill it 
i said kill it 
and let us have a feast
to celebrate this here day   
   for this son of mine was lost   
   and is found   
   was dead and has come back to life 
now  the oldest kid was
out on the farm working 
and on his way back 
as he approached the house   
   he heard music and dancing 
he called one of his servants
and asked him what it meant 
the servant said  
your brother s come back home again 
your father s killed
the fatted calf   
   because he got him back
safe and sound 
well  the brother was
rather irritated by this 
he refused to go into the house 
the father came out
and pleaded with him 
but he retorted  saying  
you know how i ve worked
for you all these years   
   and you never gave me
so much as a kid   
   for a feast with my friends 
but once this
son of yours turns up   
   after running through
your money with his women   
   you killed
the fatted calf for him 
i said kill it 
i said kill it 
 my boy   said the father 
 you ve always been with me
and everything i have is yours 
now  how could we help
but celebrate on this happy day   
   for your brother here was dead
and he s come back to life   
   metaphorically speaking 
was lost and is found  
them s my boys 
is there a man among you
who d offer his son a stone   
   when he asks for bread 
a snake  if he asks for fish 
if you  then  mad as you are   
   now know how to give your children
what is good for them   
   how much more will
your heavenly father   
   give good things   
   to those who ask for them 
treat others as you would have
them treat you 
well  that is the law
and the prophets 
the law and the prophets 
the law and the prophets 
you are the light of the world 
you are the light of the world
but if that light is under a bushel
it s lost something kind of crucial
you ve got to stay bright
to be the light of the world
you are the salt of the earth
you are the salt of the earth
but if that salt has lost its flavor
it ain t got much in its favor
you can t have that fault
and be the salt of the earth
so let your light soul shine
before men
let your light soul shine
so that they might know
some kindness again
we all need help to feel fine
let s have some wine 
you are the city of god
you are the city of god
but if that city s on a hill
it s kind of hard to hide it well
you ve got to stay pretty
in the city of god
so let your light soul shine
before men
let your light soul shine
so that they might know
some kindness again
we all need help to feel fine
let s have some wine 
you are the light of the world
you are the light of the world
but the tallest candlestick
ain t much good without a wick
you ve got to live right
to be the light of the world
stroke 
stroke 
stop 
this is the beginning 
by whose authority   
   are you acting like this 
who gave you this authority 
i have a question to ask you 
the baptism of john 
was it from god or from man 
if we say from god  he will say 
 then why did you not believe  
but if we say from men 
the people will be angry   
   for they took john as a prophet 
we do not know 
then neither will i tell you
by whose authority i act 
stop 
now  we know you are an honest man 
give us your ruling on this  
are we or are we not permitted   
   to pay taxes to the roman emperor 
why  you hypocrites 
show me the money
in which the tax is paid 
whose head is on here 
whose inscription 
caesar s 
well then  pay caesar
what is due caesar   
   but pay god what is due god 
what is the greatest commandment   
   of them all 
 thou shalt love the lord your god
with all your heart and all your soul  
this is the greatest commandment
of them all 
and the second is like it 
 thou shalt love thy neighbor
as thyself  
all the rest of the law and
what the prophets have written   
   is based on these first two 
you doctors of the law
and you pharisees   
   sit in the chair of moses 
but you say one thing
and you do another 
everything you do is done for show 
you like to have your places of honor
at feasts and in the synagogues   
   and to be greeted respectfully
and to be called  teacher  
but you must not
be called  teacher  
for you have one teacher 
the messiah 
and you must not call
any man on earth  father  
for you have one father 
and you are all brothers 
alas  for you lawyers and pharisees
hypocrites that you be
searching for souls
and fools to forsake them
you travel the land
you scour the sea
then when you ve got your converts
you make them twice as fit for hell
as you are yourselves
alas  for you lawyers and pharisees
hypocrites that you are
sure that the kingdom of heaven
awaits you
you will not venture half so far
other men who might enter the gates
you keep from passing through
drag them down with you
you snakes  you viper s brew
you cannot escape being devil s food
i send you prophets
and i send you preachers
sages in rages and ages of teachers
nothing can mar your mood
blind guide
blind fools
the blood you ve spilt
on you will fall
this nation
this generation
will bear the guilt of it all
alas  alas  alas  for you
blind fools 
oh  jerusalem 
jerusalem   
city that stones the prophets and
murders the messengers sent to her 
how often have i longed
to gather your children   
   as a hen gathers her brood
under her wings 
but you would not let me 
and so i tell you   
   you shall never see me
until the time when you say 
 blessing on him who comes
in the name of the lord  
where are you going 
where are you going 
can you take me with you 
for my hand is cold
and needs warmth
where are you going 
far beyond where the horizon lies
where the horizon lies
and the land sinks into
mellow blueness
oh please
take me with you
let me skip the road with you
i can dare myself
i can dare myself
i ll put a pebble
in my shoe
and watch me walk
i can walk and walk
i shall call the pebble dare
we will talk together
about walking
dare shall be carried
and when we both have had enough
i will take him from my shoe singing
meet your new road
then i ll take   
   your hand
finally glad
that you are here
by my side
then the man they called
judas iscariot   
   went to the chief priests
and said 
what will you give me
to betray him to you 
they paid him 30 pieces of silver 
and from that moment  he began
to look out for an opportunity   
   to betray him 
by my side
by my side
that you are here
by my side
come sing me sweet rejoicing
come sing me love
we re not afraid of voicing
all the things
we re dreaming of
oh  high and low
and everywhere we go
we can build
a beautiful city
yes we can
yes we can
we can build
a beautiful city
call it out
and call it the city of man
we don t need alabaster
we don t need chrome
we ve got our special plaster
take my hand
i ll take you home
we see nations rise
in each other s eyes
we can build
a beautiful city
yes we can
yes we can
we can build
a beautiful city
call it out
and call it the city of man
come sing me sweet rejoicing
come sing me love
we re not afraid of voicing
all the things
we re dreaming of
oh  high and low
and everywhere we go
we can build
a beautiful city
yes we can
yes we can
we can build
a beautiful city
call it out
and call it
the city of man
come on 
where 
  okay  come on 
  come here 
sit next to me  okay 
hey  that s you 
i tell you this  
one of you among us will betray me 
could it be me  lord 
how about me 
how about me 
could it be me 
could it be me 
rabbi   
   can you mean me 
the words are yours 
do quickly what you have to do 
take this and eat 
eat  for this is my body 
take this and drink   
   for this is my blood 
the blood of the covenant 
shed for the forgiveness of sins 
and i tell you   
   i shall never again drink
from the fruit of the vine   
   until i drink it again with you
in the kingdom of my father 
on the willows there
we hung up our lives
for our captors there   
   required
of our songs
and our tormentors  mirth
on the willows there
we hung up our lives
for our captors there   
   required
of our songs
and our tormentors  mirth
saying   
   sing us one
of the songs of zion
sing us one
of the songs of zion
sing us one
of the songs of zion
but how can we sing
sing the lord s song
in a foreign land 
stay here while
i go over there to pray 
my heart is ready
to break with grief 
stop here   
   and stay awake with me 
on the willows there
we hung up our lives
father   
   if it be possible   
   let this cup pass me by 
yet not as i will   
   but as thou wilt 
what 
could none of you
stay awake with me one hour 
stay awake and be spared the test 
the spirit is willing 
but the flesh is weak 
everyone else may fall away
on your account 
but i never will 
i never will 
i tell you this 
tonight  before the cock crows 
you ll betray me three times 
father  if it be not possible
for this cup to pass me by   
   without my drinking from it   
   thy   
   will   
   be done 
man does not live by bread alone 
but on every word god utters 
if you are the son of god 
throw yourself down 
scriptures say 
 he will send angels to support you  
thou shall not tempt
the lord your god 
all these things i will give you   
   if you will pay me homage 
be gone  satan 
you shall do homage
to the lord your god   
   and worship him alone 
friend   
   do quickly what you have to do 
put down the sword  he who lives
by the sword dies by the sword 
do you not suppose i could
appeal to my father   
   who d at once send
12 legions of angels 
do you take me for a bandit   
   that you come after me
with swords and cudgels 
daily i taught in the synagogue 
you didn t come after me then 
but all this has happened   
   to fulfill what the prophets
have written 
o god
i m bleeding
o god
i m bleeding
o god
you re bleeding
o god
i m dying
o god
you re dying
o god
i m dying
o god
i m dead
o god
you re dead
o god
you re dead
o god
you re dead
long live god
long live god
prepare ye
the way of the lord
prepare ye
the way of the lord
day by day
day by day
o dear lord
