 a curator s job
is an important one 
 for it is the curator
who decides
what belongs in the museum  
 in a way 
anyone who collects things
in the privacy of his own home
is a curator  
 but how did
the very first curators
 store their collections 
 they were kept
in pieces of furniture
 called cabinets of wonder 
 eventually  some collections
grew beyond the confines
 of a single cabinet
and took over entire rooms 
see figure nine

trying to find my father 
he s looking for his father 
who are you 
how do you know my name 
i saw you
at at the wolf diorama
in the museum 
what is going on 
tell me 
where 
come 
whoa 
wow 
what is this 
where are we 
 i need you to be patient with
this story and read it slowly 
 i ve worked in the queens
museum of art for 15 years now 
 but the story
i need to tell you
 begins a long time
before that 
 when i was
a little girl in 1927 
 i came to new york
for the very first time 
 it was my brother  walter 
who finally rescued me 
 i found him at
the museum of natural history 
 where he was working 
 i begged him to help me 
 to get me away
from my mother and father 
 i wanted to stay in new york 
i  i wanted to learn things  
 the first thing walter did
 was help me find a school
for deaf children 
i didn t even know
such a school existed  
 my parents divorced
when i was young 
it was a big scandal back then
because my mother was famous  
 it was there at school
i met my bill 
 who was training
to be a printer 
 we married and  before
we knew it  had a baby boy 
 times as they were 
 everyone worried about us
raising a hearing child 
 but our boy managed to handle
his lack of deafness
just fine  
 soon after i d married 
walter helped me get a job
at the museum
in the exhibitions department  
 i d always loved making
models  so it suited me well  
 i worked there for many years
alongside my son  
 but soon
planning began
for the 1964 world s fair  
the unisphere
would have to withstand
the ever changing forces
of nature 
as well as its own
enormous weight 
 one of the attractions
 was going to be the panorama 
 a scale model of the
entire city of new york 
 the largest architectural
model ever built 
 it was an opportunity
i couldn t pass up 
 so i left the museum
of natural history
 to work on the panorama
in queens 
 sadly  my bill had
passed away by then 
 so it was just my son and me 
 when the world s fair ended 
the panorama was so popular 
 they decided to keep it open 
 but they needed someone
to maintain the model 
so they hired me for the job  
 around that time 
our son was appointed
 the lead designer
for a new diorama
 at the museum
of natural history 
 the youngest person
ever to have that honor 
 but you already
know this part 
the job would send him up
to gunflint lake  
your son   
is danny 
you re my grandmother 
where is he 
i came all the way
from minnesota to find him 
where is he 
 the librarian he d contacted
to help him with his research
 happened to own a small cabin 
and he rented it from her  
miss wilson  is that you 
am i in the right place 
you are indeed  mr  lobel 
the cabin is right over there 
it s danny 
whoa 
i don t like the ice 
i don t trust it 
come on  danny 
it s not gonna break 
it s two feet thick 
  don t you trust me 
  i m not sure right now 
 dear mom 
the research is going well 
very helpful staff 
especially this librarian  
 eventually  he completed
 the diorama of the wolves 
 i still go to visit it
whenever i can 
it s the only one
he got to make  
 your dad was ill  ben 
 he had a heart condition 
the same one his father had 
 it kept him out of the war 
 but a few years after
he returned from gunflint lake 
his heart    
 this panorama is not just
a model of new york city 
it s also the story
of your father s life  
 when i took the job 
 i thought it would be fun
to secretly personalize
the panorama  
 i hid little mementos
from your father s life
inside the buildings  
we re gonna miss him 
there s nobody like him 
so  to danny 
  to danny 
  hear  hear 
 i knew everyone
at danny s funeral
 except for two people 
 a woman and a little boy 
 she introduced herself 
 and i recognized her name
from danny s letters 
 she told me she d
brought her son earlier
and showed him the diorama
danny had made  
i don t remember any of this 
that s why i dreamed of them 
the wolves 
i saw them 
what happened 
  help 
  come 
jamie 
wait  how did you get here 
i followed you 
wait 
i don t understand 
  what 
  she s the lady from
