rey i saw myself
on the dark throne
i wont let it happen
im never leaving this place
im doing what you did
i was wrong
it was fear
that kept me here
what are you most afraid of
myself
because youre a palpatine
leia knew it too
she didnt tell me
she still trained me
because she saw
your spirit
your heart
rey
some things are stronger
than blood
confronting fear
is the destiny of a jedi
your destiny
if you dont face
palpatine
it will mean the end
of the jedi
and the war will be lost
theres something my sister
would want you to have
rey grunts
softly leias saber
luke it was the last night
of her training
grunting
leia told me that she had
sensed the death of her son
at the end of her jedi path
she surrendered her saber
to me and said that one day
it would be picked up
again
by someone who would
finish her journey
a thousand generations
live in you now
but this is your fight
youll take both sabers
to exegol
i cant get there
i dont have the wayfinder

whirring

memory restoration complete
in normal voice
artoo have you heard
i am going with mistress rey
on her very first mission
r2d2 chirping
i already have
r2d2 chirping
picking up a signal
from whom
all the information you need
for an airstrike on exegol
yeah except
how to get there
are you seeing
these atmo readings
its a mess out there
magnetic crossfields
gravity wells
solar winds
how does a fleet
even take off from there
c3po terribly sorry
im afraid
artoos memory bank
must be crossed
with his logic receptors
he says he is receiving
a transmission from
master luke
thats an old craft id
thats luke skywalkers
xwing
c3po its transmitting
course marker signals
on its way
to the unknown regions
its rey
chirping
indistinct whispering
finn
shes going to exegol
shes showing us
shes showing us
how to get there
then we go together
indistinct announcement
on pa
come on buddy
we need you
finn as long as those
star destroyers are on exegol
we can hit them
beaumont hit them how
rose they cant activate
their shields
until they leave atmosphere
which isnt easy on exegol
ships that size
need help taking off
nav cant tell
which ways up out there
so how do the ships
take off
they use a signal
from a navigation tower
like this one
except they wont
air teams gonna
find the tower
ground teams
gonna blast it
ground team
i have an idea for that
once the towers down
the fleet will be stuck in atmo
for just minutes
with no shields
and no way out
we think hitting the cannons
might ignite
the main reactors
thats our chance
we need to pull
some holdo maneuvers
do some real damage
finn come on
that move is one in a million
fighters and freighters
can take out their cannons
if there are enough of us
speaks alien language
there arent enough of us
hes right wed be
no more than bugs to them
thats where lando
and chewie come in
theyll take the falcon
to the core systems
send out a call for help
for anybody listening
weve got friends
out there
theyll come if they
know theres hope
all murmuring
poe they will
first order wins by making
us think were alone
were not alone
good people will fight
if we lead them
finn leia never gave up
and neither will we
were gonna show them
were not afraid
poe what our mothers
and fathers fought for
we will not let die
not today
today we make
our last stand
for the galaxy
for leia
for everyone weve lost
theyve taken enough of us
now we take the war to them
indistinct whispering
breathing heavily
sith officer on speakers
shes on approach
pryde all ships rise

a ground invasion
on a star destroyer
i dont want to
but we cant take out
