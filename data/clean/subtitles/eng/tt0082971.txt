you can possess
which i cannot take away
and you thought i had given up
you chose the wrong friends
this time it will cost you
too bad the hovitos
dont know you the way i do
belloq
yes too bad
you could warn them
if only you spoke hovitos
jock start the engines

in the plane jock
oh thats just
my pet snake reggie
i hate snakes jock
i hate em
come on
show a little backbone will ya
neo meaning new
and lithicl th
l c meaning stone
all right lets get back
to this site
turkdean barrow near hazelton
contains a central paspassage
and three chambers or cysts
dont confuse that with
robbing in which case we mean
the removal of the contents
of the barrow
this site also demonstrates
one of the great dangers
of archaeology
not to life and limb although
that does sometimes take place
no im talking about folklore
in this case
local tradition held
that there was golden coffin
buried at the site
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow
and the generally poor condition
of the find
however chamber three
was undisturbed
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods
that were found in another uh
in the area give us a r
uh
reason to da
to uh toto date this
uh find as we have
um
any questions then
no okay thats it
for the day then
um dont forget
michaelson chapters four
and five for next time
and i will be in my office
on thursday but not wednesday
i had it marcus
i had it in my hand
what happened
guess
belloq
you want to hear about it
not at all
im sure everything you do
for the museum
conforms to
the international treaty
for the protection
of antiquities
its beautiful marcus
i can get it
i got it all figured out
theres only one place
he can sell it marrakech
i need 2000 look
listen to me old boy
i brought some people
to see you
look
i got these pieces
theyre good pieces marcus
look
indiana
yes the museum will buy them
as usual no questions asked
yes they are nice
theyre worth at least
the price
of a ticket to marrakech
but the people
i brought are important
and theyre waiting
what people
army intelligence
they knew you were coming
before i did
seem to know everything
they wouldnt tell me
what they want
well what do i want
to see them for
what am l in trouble
yes dr jones
weve heard a great deal
about you
have you
uh professor of archaeology
expert on the occult
and uh how does one say it
obtainer of rare antiquities
thats one way of saying it
why dont you sit down
youll be more comfortable
oh thank you
thank you
yes youre a man
of many talents
now you studied
under professor ravenwood
at the university of chicago
yes i did
you have no idea
of his present whereabouts
uh well just rumors really
somewhere in asia i think
i havent really spoken
to him for ten years
we were friends but uh
had a bit of a falling out
im afraid
mmm
dr jones now
you must understand
that this is all
strictly confidential eh
i understand
uh
yesterday afternoon
our european sections
intercepted a
a german communiqué
now to cairo
see over the last two years
the nazis have had teams
of archaeologists
running around the world
iooking for all kinds
of religious artifacts
hitlers a nut on the subject
hes crazy
hes obsessed with the occult
and right now apparently
theres some kind
of german archaeological dig
going on in the desert
outside of cairo
now weve got some
information here
but we cant make anything
out of it and maybe you can
tanis development proceeding
acquire headpiece staff of ra
abner ravenwood us
the nazis have discovered tanis
just what does that mean to you
uh tanis
well it
the city of tanis
is one of the possible
resting places of the lost ark
the lost ark
yeah the ark of the covenant
the chest the hebrews used
to carry around
the ten commandments
what do you mean
commandments
you talking
about the ten commandments
yes the actual
ten commandments
the original stone tablets
that moses brought down
out of mount horeb and smashed
if you believe
in that sort of thing
any of you guys
ever go to sunday school
well i
oh look
the hebrews took
the broken pieces
and put them in the ark
when they settled in canaan
they put the ark in a place
called the temple of solomon
in jerusalem
where it stayed for many years
until all of a sudden
whoosh its gone
where
well nobody knows
where or when
however an egyptian pharaoh
shishak
yes
invaded the city of jerusalem
right about 980 bc
and he may have taken the ark
back to the city of tanis
and hidden it
in a secret chamber
called the well of souls
secret chamber
however about a year
after the pharaoh
would return to egypt
the city of tanis was
consumed by the desert
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year
wiped clean by the wrath of god
uhhuh
obviously weve come
to the right men
now you seem to know uh
all about this tanis then
no no not really
ravenwood is the real expert
abner did the first serious work
on tanis
collected some of its relics
it was his obsession really
but he never found the city
frankly were somewhat
suspicious of mr ravenwood
an american being mentioned
so prominently
in a secret nazi cable
oh rubbish
ravenwoods no nazi
well what do the nazis
want him for then
well obviously
the nazis are looking
for the headpiece
to the staff of ra
and they think abners got it
what exactly is a headpiece
to the staff of ra
well the staff
is just a stick
i dont know about this big
nobody really knows
for sure how high
and its its uh
its capped
with an elaborate headpiece
in the shape of the sun
with a crystal in the center
and what you did was
you take the staff
to a special room in tanis
a map room with a miniature
of the city all laid out
on the floor
and if you put the staff
in a certain place
at a certain time of day
the sun shone through here
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here
and gave you the exact location
of the well of the souls
where the ark of the covenant
was kept right
which is exactly what the nazis
are looking for
what does this ark look like
uh
theres a picture of it
right here
thats it
good god
yes thats just
what the hebrews thought
uh
now whats that supposed to be
coming out of there
lightning
fire
power of god or something
im beginning to understand
hitlers interest in this
oh yes
the bible speaks of the
ark leveling mountains
and laying waste
to entire regions
an army which carries
the ark before it
is invincible
you did it didnt you
they want you to go for it
oh marcus
they want you to get ahold of
the ark before the nazis do
and theyre prepared
to pay handsomely for it
and the museum
the museum gets the ark
when were finished
oh yes
oh
the ark of the covenant
nothing else has come close
that thing represents everything
we got into archaeology
for in the first place
mmm
you know five years ago
i wouldve gone after it myself
im really rather envious
ive got to locate abner
i think i know where to start
suppose shell
still be with him
possibly but
marions the least
of your worries right now
believe me indy
what do you mean
well i mean that
for nearly 3000 years
man has been searching
for the lost ark
not something to be taken
lightly
no one knows its secrets
its like nothing youve ever
gone after before
oh marcus
what are you trying to do
scare me
you sound like my mother
weve known each other
for a long time
i dont believe in magic
a lot of superstitious
hocuspocus
im going after a find
of incredible
historical significance
youre talking
about the bogeyman
besides you know
what a cautious fellow i am
nice to see you again
dr jones
thank you
shh shh
shh
give him space
give him space
go on regan
shh shh
shh shh shh
hello marion

through my door
i never doubted that
something made it inevitable
so what are you doing here
in nepal
i need one of the pieces
your father collected
i learned to hate you
in the last ten years
i never meant to hurt you
i was a child
i was in love
it was wrong and you knew it
you knew what you were doing
now i do
this is my place
get out
i did what i did
you dont have to be happy
about it
but maybe we could help
each other out now
i need one of the pieces
your father collected
bronze piece about this size
with a hole in it offcenter
with a crystal
you know the one i mean
yeah
i know it
wheres abner
wheres abner
abners dead
marion im sorry
do you know what you did to me

i can only say
im sorry so many times
well say it again anyway

iooking
for his little bits of junk
im sorry to still be
stuck in this dive
everybodys sorry for something
its a worthless bronze
medallion marion

maybe
i dont know where it is
well maybe you could find it
3000 bucks
well that will get me back
but not in style
i can get you another two
when we get to the states
its important marion
trust me
you know the piece i mean
do you know where it is
come back tomorrow

because i said so thats why
ha
see you tomorrow indiana jones
good evening fraulein
the bars closed
we we are
not thirsty
what do you want
the same thing your friend
dr jones wanted
surely he told you
there would be
other interested parties
mustve slipped his mind
the man is nefarious
i hope for your sake
he has not yet acquired it
why are you willing
to offer more
oh almost certainly
do you still have it
no
but i know where it is
hey how about a drink
for you and your men
your fire is dying here
why dont you tell me
where the piece is right now
listen herr mac
i dont know what kind of people
youre used to dealing with
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place
fraulein ravenwood
let me show you
what i am used to
take your hands off me
take your lousy hands off
wait a minute
wait i i can be reasonable
that time is passed
you dont need that
wait
ill tell you everything
yes i know you will
let her go
whiskey

shoot them both
my medallion
well jones at least
you havent forgotten
how to show a lady a good time
boy youre something
yeah ill tell you what
until i get back my 5000
youre going to get more
than you bargained for
im your goddamn partner
cairo city of the living
a paradise on earth
silence
why do you forget yourselves
what is this
where did this animal come from
oh oh no
cute
what an adorable creature
then it shall be welcome
in our house
oh well no you dont have to
keep it here just because of me
i knew the germans
would hire you sallah
youre the best digger in egypt
my services are entirely
inconsequential to them
theyve hired or shanghaied
every digger in cairo
the excavation is enormous
they hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them
its as if the pharaohs
had returned
when did they find the map room
three days ago
they have not one brain
among them
except one
he is very clever
hes a french archaeologist
whats his name
they call him bellosh
belloq belloq
the germans have
a great advantage over us
they are near to discovering
the well of souls
well theyre not
going to find it without this
who can tell us
about these markings
perhaps a man i know
can help us
indy
there is something
that troubles me
what is it
the ark
if it is there at tanis
then it is something that man
was not meant to disturb
death has always surrounded it
it is not of this earth
do we need the monkey huh
im surprised at you jones
talking that way about our baby
hes got your looks too
and your brains
oops
i noticed that
shes a smart little thing
smart
hey
hey where you going
shell be all right
have a date
come on come on
okay
marion
whats this
its a date
you eat em
how come you havent found some
nice girl to settle down with
raise eight or nine kids
like your friend sallah
who says i havent
i do
dad had you figured
a long time ago
he said you were a bum
oh hes being generous
the most gifted bum
he ever trained
you know he loved you
like a son
took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him
not much just you
marion get out of here
duck
right
shh shh
marion
help over here indy
get out of the way
move move it
help me
you cant do this to me
im an american
indy
indiana jones
help me jones
jones
marion
indy
marion
dr jones
you looking for me
belloq
good afternoon dr jones
i ought to kill you right now
not a very private place
for a murder
well these arabs dont care
if we kill each other
theyre not going
to interfere in our business
it was not i who brought
the girl into this business
please sit down
before you fall down
we can at least behave
like civilized people
i see your taste in friends
remains consistent
how odd that it should end
this way for us
after so many
stimulating encounters
i almost regret it
where shall i find
a new adversary
so close to my own level
try the local sewer
you and i are very much alike
archaeology is our religion
yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith
our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend
i am a shadowy
reflection of you
it would take only a nudge
to make you like me
to push you out of the light
now youre getting nasty
you know its true
how nice
look at this
its worthless
ten dollars
from a vendor in the street
but i take it
i bury it in the sand
for a thousand years
it becomes priceless
like the ark
men will kill for it
men like you and me
what about your boss
der fuehrer
i thought he was waiting
to take possession
all in good time
when i am finished with it
jones do you realize
what the ark is
its a transmitter
its a radio
for speaking to god
and its within my reach
you want to talk to god
lets go see him together
ive got nothing better to do
uncle indy come back home now
uncle indy
next time indiana jones
itll take more than children
to save you
uncle indy
i thought i would
find you there
better than the united
states marines eh
marions dead
yes i know
and me and me
im sorry
life goes on indy
there is the proof
uhoh
i have much to tell you
first we will take them home
and then i will take you
to the old man
i cant figure out
how belloq did it
whered he get a copy
of the headpiece
there are no pictures
no duplicates of it anywhere
i tell you only what i saw
with my own eyes
a headpiece like that one
except round the edges
which were rougher
in the center the frenchman
had embedded a crystal
and and surrounding
the crystal on one side
there were raised markings
just like that one
they made their calculations
in the map room
this morning
belloq and the boss german
dietrich
when they came out
of the map room
they gave us a new spot
in which to dig
out away from the camp
the well of the souls huh
come come look
look here look
sit down
come sit down
what is it
this is a warning
not to disturb
the ark of the covenant
what about the height
of the staff though
did belloq get it off of here
yes
it is here
this were the old way
this mean six kadam high
about 72 inches
wait
and take back one kadam
to honor the hebrew god
whose ark this is
you said their headpiece
only had markings on one side
are you absolutely sure
belloqs staff is too long
theyre digging
in the wrong place
i am the monarch of the sea
i am the ruler of the
bad dates
i told you not to be premature
in your communiqué to berlin
archaeology is not
an exact science
it does not deal
in time schedules
the fuehrer is not
a patient man
he demands constant reports
and he expects progress
you led me to believe
nothing
i made no promises
i only said
it looked very favorable
besides with the information
in our possession
my calculations were correct
boy theyre not kidding
are they
what time does the sun
hit the map room
at about 900 in the morning
not much time then
where are they digging
for the well of the souls
on that ridge
but the map rooms over there
lets go come on
sallah
sallah
theyre here
please my friend
what is the matter
i fetch the water
i shall get it for you
if you want water
i will get you water
no problem no problem
i thought you were dead
you must have switched baskets
are you hurt
no you have to get me
out of here quick
theyre gonna be back
at any minute
cut me loose
quick
they keep asking about you
what you know
whats wrong
cut me loose
i know where the ark is marion
the arks here
im coming with you jones
get me out of here
cut me loose
you cant leave me here
if i take you out of here now
theyll start combing
the place for us
jones youve got to get me
out of here
come on jones are you crazy
marion i hate to do this
but if you dont sit
still and keep quiet
this whole thing
is going to be shot
ill be back to get you
jones whats the matter
thats it
who knows
perhaps the ark is still waiting
in some antechamber
for us to discover
perhaps theres some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us
perhaps
perhaps the girl can help us
my feeling exactly
she was in possession
of the original piece for years
she may know much
if properly motivated
i tell you
the girl knows nothing
im surprised
to find you squeamish
that is not your reputation
but it neednt concern you
i have the perfect man
for this kind of work
heil hitler
indy here
weve hit stone
clear it off
come on find the edges
good good good
you see indy you see
okay bring the pry bars in
as a team boys as a team
push
get em in there
get em under

watch your toes
carefully carefully
sorry indy
indy
why does the floor move
give me your torch
snakes
why did it have to be snakes
asps
very dangerous
you go first
if youre trying
to escape on foot
the desert is three weeks
in every direction
so please eat something
i must apologize
for their treatment of you
yeah whose idea was it
no food no water
what kind of people
are these friends of yours
at this particular time
and place to do my work
they are necessary evils
theyre not my friends
however with the
right connections
even in this part of the world
we are not entirely uncivilized
its beautiful
i would very much like
to see you in it
ill bet you would
all right
what do you got to drink
around here
we dont have much time
soon they will come to harm you
soon they will come to harm you
and i will not be able
to stop them
unless you are able
to give me something
to placate them
some uh piece
of information
which i can use
to protect you from them
ive already told you
everything i know
i have no loyalty to jones
hes brought me
nothing but trouble
marion you are beautiful
i dont think
we need a chaperone

value where were headed
shell bring a very good price
mmm
herr colonel
that cargo youve taken
if its your goal
go in peace with it
but leave us the girl
it would reduce our loss
on this trip
savage
you are not in the position
to ask for anything
we will take what we wish
and then decide whether or not
to blow your ship
from the water
the girl goes with me
shell be part
of my compensation
im sure your fuehrer
would approve
if she fails to please me
you may do with her as you wish
i will waste
no more time with her now
excuse me
i cant find mr jones captain
ive looked everywhere
hes got to be here somewhere
look again
i found him
where
there
the altar has been
prepared in accordance
with your radio instructions
sir
good
take the ark there immediately
monsieur
i am uncomfortable
with the thought
of this jewish ritual
are you sure its necessary
let me ask you this
would you be more comfortable
opening the ark in berlin
for your fuehrer
finding out only then
if the sacred pieces
of the covenant are inside
knowing only then
whether you have accomplished
your mission
and obtained the one true ark
hello
jones
jones
im going to blow up the ark
rene
your persistence
surprises even me
youre going to give
mercenaries a bad name
dr jones
surely you dont think you can
escape from this island
that depends on how reasonable
were all willing to be
all i want is the girl
if we refuse
then your fuehrer has no prize
okay stand back
all of you stand back
stand back
okay jones
you win
blow it up
yes blow it up
blow it back to god
all your life has been spent
in pursuit
of archaeological relics
inside the ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations
you want to see it open
as well as i
indiana
we are simply passing
through history
this
this is history
do as you will
marion dont look at it
shut your eyes marion
dont look at it
no matter what happens
ah
its beautiful
indy
dont look marion
keep your eyes shut
marion
youve done your country a
great service and we thank you

the settlement satisfactory
oh the moneys fine
the situations
totally unacceptable
well gentlemen
i guess that just about
wraps it up
