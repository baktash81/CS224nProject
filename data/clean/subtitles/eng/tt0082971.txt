three days 
they re following us 
if they knew we were here 
they would ve killed us already 
this is it 
this is where forrestal
cashed in 
a friend of yours 
a competitor 
he was good 
he was very  very good 
señor    nobody s
come out of there alive 
please   
señor 
stop 
stay out of the light 
forrestal 
let us hurry 
there is nothing to fear here 
that s what scares me 
stay here 
if you insist  señor 
give me the whip 
throw me the idol 
no time to argue 
throw me the idol 
i throw you the whip 
give me the whip 
adios  señor 
adios  satipo 
dr  jones 
again we see there is nothing
you can possess
which i cannot take away 
and you thought i had given up 
you chose the wrong friends 
this time  it will cost you 
too bad the hovitos   
don t know you the way i do 
belloq 
yes  too bad 
you could warn them 
if only you spoke hovitos 
jock  start the engines 
get it up 
jock  the engines 
start the engines  jock 
there s a big snake
in the plane  jock 
oh  that s just
my pet snake reggie 
i hate snakes  jock 
i hate  em 
come on 
show a little backbone  will ya 
 neo   meaning  new 
and  lithic    l  t h   
   l  c  meaning  stone  
all right  let s get back
to this site 
turkdean barrow  near hazelton 
contains a central pas passage
and three chambers  or cysts   
   don t confuse that with
robbing  in which case we mean
the removal of the contents
of the barrow 
this site also demonstrates   
   one of the great dangers
of archaeology   
not to life and limb  although
that does sometimes take place   
no  i m talking about folklore 
in this case 
local tradition held
that there was golden coffin
buried at the site 
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow
and the generally poor condition
of the find 
however  chamber three
was undisturbed 
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods
that were found in another  uh   
in the area  give us a r   
uh   
   reason to da   
to  uh  to to date this 
uh  find as we have 
um   
any questions  then 
no  okay  that s it
for the day  then 
um  don t forget   
michaelson  chapters four
and five for next time 
and i will be in my office
on thursday  but not wednesday 
i had it  marcus 
i had it in my hand 
what happened 
guess 
belloq 
you want to hear about it 
not at all 
i m sure everything you do
for the museum
conforms to
the international treaty
for the protection
of antiquities 
it s beautiful  marcus 
i can get it 
i got it all figured out 
there s only one place
he can sell it  marrakech 
i need  2 000  look   
listen to me  old boy 
i brought some people
to see you 
look 
i got these pieces 
they re good pieces  marcus 
  look 
  indiana   
yes  the museum will buy them 
as usual  no questions asked 
yes  they are nice 
they re worth at least
the price
of a ticket to marrakech 
but the people
i brought are important 
and they re waiting 
what people 
army intelligence 
they knew you were coming
before i did 
seem to know everything 
they wouldn t tell me
what they want 
well  what do i want
to see them for 
what am l  in trouble 
yes  dr  jones 
we ve heard a great deal
about you 
have you 
uh  professor of archaeology 
expert on the occult 
and  uh  how does one say it 
obtainer of rare antiquities 
that s one way of saying it 
why don t you sit down 
you ll be more comfortable 
  oh  thank you 
  thank you 
yes  you re a man
of many talents 
now  you studied
under professor ravenwood
at the university of chicago 
yes  i did 
you have no idea
of his present whereabouts 
uh    well  just rumors  really 
somewhere in asia  i think 
i haven t really spoken
to him for ten years 
we were friends  but  uh   
had a bit of a falling out 
i m afraid 
mmm 
dr  jones  now 
you must understand
that this is all
strictly confidential  eh 
i understand 
uh   
yesterday afternoon 
our european sections
intercepted a   
a german communiqué
  now  to cairo   
  see  over the last two years 
the nazis have had teams
of archaeologists
running around the world
iooking for all kinds
of religious artifacts 
hitler s a nut on the subject 
he s crazy 
he s obsessed with the occult 
and  right now  apparently 
there s some kind
of german archaeological dig
going on in the desert
outside of cairo 
now  we ve got some
information here 
but we can t make anything
out of it  and maybe you can 
 tanis development proceeding 
 acquire headpiece  staff of ra 
abner ravenwood  u s  
the nazis have discovered tanis 
just what does that mean to you 
uh  tanis 
well  it   
the city of tanis
is one of the possible
resting places of the lost ark 
the lost ark 
yeah  the ark of the covenant 
the chest the hebrews used
to carry around
the ten commandments 
what do you mean 
 commandments  
you talking
about the ten commandments 
yes  the actual
ten commandments 
the original stone tablets
that moses brought down
out of mount horeb and smashed 
if you believe
in that sort of thing 
any of you guys
ever go to sunday school 
well  i   
oh  look 
the hebrews took
the broken pieces
and put them in the ark 
when they settled in canaan 
they put the ark in a place
called the temple of solomon 
in jerusalem 
where it stayed for many years 
until  all of a sudden 
whoosh  it s gone 
where 
well  nobody knows
where or when 
however  an egyptian pharaoh   
  shishak 
  yes 
   invaded the city of jerusalem
right about 980 bc 
and he may have taken the ark
back to the city of tanis
and hidden it
in a secret chamber
called the well of souls 
secret chamber 
however  about a year
after the pharaoh
would return to egypt 
the city of tanis was
consumed by the desert
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year 
wiped clean by the wrath of god 
uh huh 
obviously  we ve come
to the right men 
now you seem to know  uh 
all about this tanis  then 
no  no  not really 
ravenwood is the real expert 
abner did the first serious work
on tanis 
collected some of its relics 
it was his obsession  really 
but he never found the city 
frankly  we re somewhat
suspicious of mr  ravenwood 
an american being mentioned
so prominently
in a secret nazi cable 
oh  rubbish 
ravenwood s no nazi 
well  what do the nazis
want him for  then 
well  obviously 
the nazis are looking
for the headpiece
to the staff of ra
and they think abner s got it 
what exactly is a headpiece
to the staff of ra 
well  the staff
is just a stick   
i don t know  about this big 
nobody really knows
for sure how high   
and it s    it s  uh   
it s capped
with an elaborate headpiece   
in the shape of the sun 
with a crystal in the center 
and what you did was
you take the staff
to a special room in tanis   
a map room with a miniature
of the city all laid out
on the floor   
and if you put the staff
in a certain place 
at a certain time of day 
the sun shone through here
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here   
and gave you the exact location
of the well of the souls 
where the ark of the covenant
was kept  right 
which is exactly what the nazis
are looking for 
what does this ark look like 
uh   
there s a picture of it
right here 
that s it 
good god 
yes  that s just
what the hebrews thought 
uh   
now  what s that supposed to be
coming out of there 
lightning   
fire   
power of god or something 
i m beginning to understand
hitler s interest in this 
oh  yes 
the bible speaks of the
ark leveling mountains 
and laying waste
to entire regions 
an army which carries
the ark before it   
is invincible 
you did it  didn t you 
they want you to go for it 
oh  marcus 
they want you to get ahold of
the ark before the nazis do
and they re prepared
to pay handsomely for it 
and the museum 
the museum gets the ark
when we re finished 
oh  yes 
oh   
the ark of the covenant 
nothing else has come close 
that thing represents everything
we got into archaeology
for in the first place 
mmm 
you know  five years ago 
i would ve gone after it myself 
i m really rather envious 
i ve got to locate abner 
i think i know where to start 
suppose she ll
still be with him 
possibly  but   
marion s the least
of your worries right now 
believe me  indy 
what do you mean 
well  i mean that
for nearly 3 000 years 
man has been searching
for the lost ark 
not something to be taken
lightly 
no one knows its secrets 
it s like nothing you ve ever
gone after before 
oh  marcus 
what are you trying to do 
scare me 
you sound like my mother 
we ve known each other
for a long time 
i don t believe in magic 
a lot of superstitious
hocus pocus 
i m going after a find
of incredible
historical significance 
you re talking
about the bogeyman 
besides  you know
what a cautious fellow i am 
nice to see you again 
dr  jones 
thank you 
shh    shh   
shh   
give him space 
give him space 
go on  regan 
shh  shh 
shh  shh  shh 
hello  marion 
indiana jones 
always knew  someday 
you d come walking back
through my door 
i never doubted that 
something made it inevitable 
so  what are you doing here
in nepal 
i need one of the pieces
your father collected 
i learned to hate you
in the last ten years 
i never meant to hurt you 
i was a child 
i was in love 
it was wrong and you knew it 
you knew what you were doing 
now i do 
this is my place 
get out 
i did what i did 
you don t have to be happy
about it 
but maybe we could help
each other out now 
i need one of the pieces
your father collected 
bronze piece  about this size 
with a hole in it  off center 
with a crystal 
you know the one i mean 
yeah 
i know it 
where s abner 
where s abner 
abner s dead 
marion  i m sorry 
do you know what you did to me 
to my life 
i can only say
i m sorry so many times 
well  say it again  anyway 
sorry 
yeah  everybody s sorry 
abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth
iooking
for his little bits of junk 
i m sorry to still be
stuck in this dive 
everybody s sorry for something 
it s a worthless bronze
medallion  marion 
you going to give it to me 
maybe 
i don t know where it is 
well  maybe you could find it 
3 000 bucks 
well  that will get me back 
but not in style 
i can get you another two
when we get to the states 
it s important  marion 
trust me 
you know the piece i mean 
do you know where it is 
come back tomorrow 
why 
because i said so  that s why 
ha 
see you tomorrow  indiana jones 
good evening  fraulein 
the bar s closed 
we    we are   
not thirsty 
what do you want 
the same thing your friend
dr  jones wanted 
surely he told you
there would be
other interested parties 
must ve slipped his mind 
the man is    nefarious 
i hope  for your sake 
he has not yet acquired it 
why  are you willing
to offer more 
oh  almost certainly 
do you still have it 
no 
but i know where it is 
hey  how about a drink
for you and your men 
your fire is dying here 
why don t you tell me
where the piece is right now 
listen  herr mac   
i don t know what kind of people
you re used to dealing with 
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place 
fraulein ravenwood 
let me show you
what i am used to 
take your hands off me 
take your lousy hands off 
wait a minute 
wait  i    i can be reasonable 
that time is passed 
you don t need that 
wait   
i ll tell you everything 
yes  i know you will 
let her go 
whiskey 
shoot them 
shoot them both 
my medallion 
well  jones  at least
you haven t forgotten
how to show a lady a good time 
boy  you re something 
yeah  i ll tell you what 
until i get back my  5 000 
you re going to get more
than you bargained for 
i m your goddamn partner 
cairo  city of the living 
a paradise on earth 
silence 
why do you forget yourselves 
what is this 
where did this animal come from 
oh    oh  no 
cute 
what an adorable creature 
then it shall be welcome
in our house 
oh  well  no  you don t have to
keep it here just because of me 
i knew the germans
would hire you  sallah 
you re the best digger in egypt 
my services are entirely
inconsequential to them 
they ve hired or shanghaied
every digger in cairo 
the excavation is enormous 
they hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them 
it s as if the pharaohs
had returned 
when did they find the map room 
three days ago 
they have not one brain
among them 
except one 
he is very clever 
he s a french archaeologist 
what s his name 
they call him  bellosh  
belloq  belloq 
the germans have
a great advantage over us 
they are near to discovering
the well of souls 
well  they re not
going to find it without this 
who can tell us
about these markings 
perhaps a man i know
can help us 
indy   
there is something
that troubles me 
what is it 
the ark 
if it is there  at tanis 
then it is something that man
was not meant to disturb 
death has always surrounded it 
it is not of this earth 
do we need the monkey  huh 
i m surprised at you  jones   
talking that way about our baby 
he s got your looks  too 
and your brains 
oops 
i noticed that 
she s a smart little thing   
smart 
hey 
hey  where you going 
she ll be all right 
have a date 
come on  come on 
okay   
marion 
what s this 
it s a date 
you eat  em 
how come you haven t found some
nice girl to settle down with 
raise eight or nine kids 
like your friend sallah 
who says i haven t 
i do 
dad had you figured
a long time ago 
he said you were a bum 
oh  he s being generous 
the most gifted bum
he ever trained 
you know  he loved you
like a son 
took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him 
not much  just you 
marion  get out of here 
duck 
right 
shh  shh 
marion 
help  over here  indy 
get out of the way 
move  move it 
help me 
you can t do this to me 
i m an american 
indy 
indiana jones 
help me  jones 
jones 
marion 
indy 
marion   
dr  jones 
you looking for me 
belloq 
good afternoon  dr  jones 
i ought to kill you right now 
not a very private place
for a murder 
well  these arabs don t care
if we kill each other 
they re not going
to interfere in our business 
it was not i who brought
the girl into this business 
please  sit down
before you fall down 
we can at least behave
like civilized people 
i see your taste in friends
remains consistent 
how odd that it should end
this way for us 
after so many
stimulating encounters 
i almost regret it 
where shall i find
a new adversary
so close to my own level 
try the local sewer 
you and i are very much alike 
archaeology is our religion 
yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith 
our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend 
i am a shadowy
reflection of you 
it would take only a nudge
to make you like me 
to push you out of the light 
now you re getting nasty 
you know it s true 
how nice 
look at this 
it s worthless 
ten dollars
from a vendor in the street 
but i take it 
i bury it in the sand
for a thousand years 
it becomes priceless   
like the ark 
men will kill for it 
men like you and me 
what about your boss 
der fuehrer 
i thought he was waiting
to take possession 
all in good time 
when i am finished with it 
jones  do you realize
what the ark is 
it s a transmitter 
it s a radio
for speaking to god 
and it s within my reach 
you want to talk to god 
let s go see him together 
i ve got nothing better to do 
uncle indy  come back home now 
uncle indy 
next time  indiana jones 
it ll take more than children
to save you 
uncle indy 
i thought i would
find you there 
better than the united
states marines  eh 
marion s dead 
yes  i know 
and me  and me 
i m sorry 
life goes on  indy 
there is the proof 
uh oh 
i have much to tell you 
first we will take them home 
and then i will take you
to the old man 
i can t figure out
how belloq did it 
where d he get a copy
of the headpiece 
there are no pictures 
no duplicates of it anywhere 
i tell you only what i saw
with my own eyes 
a headpiece like that one 
except round the edges 
which were rougher 
in the center  the frenchman
had embedded a crystal 
and    and surrounding
the crystal  on one side 
there were raised markings 
just like that one 
they made their calculations
in the map room 
this morning 
belloq and the boss german 
dietrich 
when they came out
of the map room 
they gave us a new spot
in which to dig 
out away from the camp 
the well of the souls  huh 
come  come  look 
look here    look 
sit down 
come  sit down 
what is it 
this is a warning
not to disturb
the ark of the covenant 
what about the height
of the staff  though 
did belloq get it off of here 
yes 
it is here 
this were the old way 
this mean six kadam high 
  about 72 inches 
  wait 
 and take back one kadam
to honor the hebrew god
whose ark this is  
you said their headpiece
only had markings on one side 
are you absolutely sure 
belloq s staff is too long 
they re digging
in the wrong place 
i am the monarch of the sea
i am the ruler of the   
bad dates 
i told you not to be premature
in your communiqué to berlin 
archaeology is not
an exact science 
it does not deal
in time schedules 
the fuehrer is not
a patient man 
he demands constant reports 
and he expects progress 
you led me to believe   
nothing 
i made no promises 
i only said
it looked very favorable 
besides  with the information
in our possession 
my calculations were correct 
boy  they re not kidding 
are they 
what time does the sun
hit the map room 
at about 9 00 in the morning 
not much time  then 
where are they digging
for the well of the souls 
on that ridge   
but the map room s over there 
let s go  come on 
sallah 
sallah 
they re here 
please  my friend 
what is the matter 
i fetch the water 
i shall get it for you 
if you want water 
i will get you water 
no problem  no problem 
i thought you were dead 
you must have switched baskets 
are you hurt 
no  you have to get me
out of here  quick 
they re gonna be back
at any minute 
cut me loose 
quick 
they keep asking about you 
what you know 
what s wrong 
cut me loose 
i know where the ark is  marion 
the ark s here 
i m coming with you  jones 
get me out of here 
cut me loose 
you can t leave me here 
if i take you out of here now 
they ll start combing
the place for us 
jones  you ve got to get me
out of here 
come on  jones  are you crazy  
marion  i hate to do this 
but if you don t sit
still and keep quiet 
this whole thing
is going to be shot 
i ll be back to get you 
jones  what s the matter 
that s it 
who knows 
perhaps the ark is still waiting
in some antechamber
for us to discover 
perhaps there s some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us 
perhaps   
perhaps the girl can help us 
my feeling exactly 
she was in possession
of the original piece for years 
she may know much 
if properly motivated 
i tell you 
the girl knows nothing 
i m surprised
to find you squeamish 
that is not your reputation 
but it needn t concern you 
i have the perfect man
for this kind of work 
heil hitler 
indy  here 
we ve hit stone 
clear it off 
come on  find the edges 
good  good  good 
you see  indy  you see 
okay  bring the pry bars in 
as a team  boys  as a team 
push 
get  em in there 
get  em under 
good  good  that s it 
watch your toes 
carefully  carefully 
sorry  indy 
indy   
why does the floor move 
give me your torch 
snakes 
why did it have to be snakes 
asps 
very dangerous 
you go first 
if you re trying
to escape on foot 
the desert is three weeks
in every direction 
so please  eat something 
i must apologize
for their treatment of you 
yeah  whose idea was it 
no food  no water 
what kind of people
are these friends of yours 
at this particular time
and place  to do my work 
they are necessary evils 
they re not my friends 
however  with the
right connections 
even in this part of the world 
we are not entirely uncivilized 
it s beautiful 
i would very much like
to see you in it 
i ll bet you would 
all right 
what do you got to drink
around here 
we don t have much time 
soon they will come to harm you 
soon they will come to harm you 
and i will not be able
to stop them 
unless you are able
to give me something
to placate them 
some  uh  piece
of information   
which i can use
to protect you from them 
i ve already told you
everything i know 
i have no loyalty to jones 
he s brought me
nothing but trouble 
marion  you are beautiful 
i don t think
we need a chaperone 
steadily 
steadily  whoa 
down   
down    whoa 
carefully  carefully 
you all right  indy 
now gently  boys 
gently  gently 
whoa   
i told you it will be all right 
huh   
sallah  get down here

oh  that s good 
whoops 
what is this stuff  rene 
i grew up with this 
it s my family label 
well    i have to be
going now  rene 
i like you  rene  very much 
perhaps we ll meet someday
under better circumstances 
we meet again  fraulein 
you americans 
you re all the same 
always overdressing
for the wrong occasions 
now   
what shall we talk about 
all right    take it up 
easy 
you re as stubborn as that girl 
you like her too much  i think 
your methods of archaeology
are too primitive for me 
you would use a bulldozer
to find a    china cup 
shliemann  wake your men 
indy  the torches
are burning out 
go on  get out of here 
hyah 
sallah 
hello 
hello 
why  dr  jones 
whatever are you doing
in such a nasty place 
why don t you come on down here 
i ll show you 
thank you  my friend 
but i think we are all
very comfortable up here 
that s right  isn t it 
yes  we are very comfortable
up here 
so  once again  jones 
what was briefly yours
is now mine 
what a fitting end
to your life s pursuits 
you re about to become
a permanent addition
to this archaeological find 
who knows 
in a thousand years 
even you may be worth something 
son of a bitch 
i m afraid we must be
going now  dr  jones 
our prize is awaited in berlin 
but i do not wish to leave you
down in that awful place
all alone 
slimy pig  you let me go

i ll get you for this 
indiana jones

our success in the desert

when we are very far
from here

engines have stopped 
i m going to go check

we have most important friends 
holy shit 
i sent my man for you 
you and the girl must disappear 
we have a place in the hold 
come on  go  go  go

where is dr  jones 
what s the big idea 
let go 
don t you touch me 
what about jones 
there s no trace yet  sir 
jones is dead 
i killed him 
he was of no use to us 
this girl  however  has certain
value where we re headed 
she ll bring a very good price 
mmm 
herr colonel 
that cargo you ve taken   
if it s your goal 
go in peace with it 
but leave us the girl 
it would reduce our loss
on this trip 
savage 
you are not in the position
to ask for anything 
we will take what we wish 
and then decide whether or not
to blow your ship
from the water 
the girl goes with me 
she ll be part
of my compensation 
i m sure your fuehrer
would approve 
if she fails to please me 
you may do with her as you wish 
i will waste
no more time with her now 
excuse me 
i can t find mr  jones  captain 
i ve looked everywhere 
he s got to be here somewhere 
look again 
  i found him 
  where 
there 
the altar has been
prepared in accordance
with your radio instructions 
sir 
good 
take the ark there immediately 
monsieur   
i am uncomfortable
with the thought
of this    jewish ritual 
are you sure it s necessary 
let me ask you this 
would you be more comfortable
opening the ark in berlin 
for your fuehrer 
finding out  only then 
if the sacred pieces
of the covenant are inside 
knowing  only then 
whether you have accomplished
your mission 
and obtained the one true ark 
hello 
jones 
jones 
i m going to blow up the ark 
rene 
your persistence
surprises even me 
you re going to give
mercenaries a bad name 
dr  jones   
surely you don t think you can
escape from this island 
that depends on how reasonable
we re all willing to be 
all i want is the girl 
if we refuse 
then your fuehrer has no prize 
okay  stand back 
all of you  stand back 
stand back 
okay  jones 
you win 
blow it up 
yes  blow it up 
blow it back to god 
all your life has been spent
in pursuit
of archaeological relics 
inside the ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations 
you want to see it open
as well as i 
indiana   
we are simply passing
through history 
this   
this is history 
do as you will 
marion  don t look at it 
shut your eyes  marion 
don t look at it 
no matter what happens 
ah   
it s beautiful 
indy 
don t look  marion 
keep your eyes shut 
marion 
you ve done your country a
great service  and we thank you
and we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory 
oh  the money s fine 
the situation s
totally unacceptable 
well  gentlemen 
i guess that just about
wraps it up 
where is the ark 
i thought we d settled that 
the ark is somewhere very safe 
from whom 
the ark is a source
of unspeakable power
and it has to be researched 
and it will be 
i assure you  dr  brody 
dr  jones 
we have top men
working on it right now 
who 
top men 
hey  what happened 
you don t look very happy 
fools  bureaucratic fools 
what d they say 
they don t know
what they ve got there
