i dont view this event
as a failure
you call it a success
we have a lead
a fingerprint left by the assassin
hes one of us
who is it
what can you tell me
about treadstone
treadstone
its where the trail deadends
if you want an answer
youre going to have to give me

a very short leash
and youll give a full report
to the group i wanna know
where youre going with this
sir
ward
yes
pamela landy
hey pam
what can i do for you
i was hoping you had
some time for me
time for what
im free right now actually
that sounds ominous
let me check my schedule
excuse me
i need to uh
excuse me can i help you
yeah im here to see mr abbott
twenty minutes
see ya
operation treadstone
never heard of it
thats not gonna fly
with all due respect pam i think you
mightve wandered past your pay grade
thats a warrant from director marshall
granting me unrestricted access to
all personnel and materials
associated with treadstone
so what are we looking at
i wanna know about it
know about it
it was a kill squad
blackonblack
we closed it down two years ago
nobody wants to know about treadstone
not around here
so i think you better take this
back to marty and let him know
exactly what youre doing
he does
ive been down to the archives
i have the files ward
lets talk about conklin
what are you after pam
you wanna fry me
you want my desk is that it
i wanna know what happened
what happened
jason bourne happened
you got the files
then lets cut the crap
conklin had these guys wound so tight
they were bound to snap
bourne was his numberone
the guy went for a job screwed the op
never came back
conklin couldnt fix it
couldnt find bourne couldnt adjust
it all went sideways
so you had conklin killed
i mean if were cutting the crap
ive given 30 years
and two marriages to this agency
ive shoveled shit on four continents
im due to retire next year
but if you think im gonna sit here
and let you dangle me with this
you can go to hell and marshall too
it had to be done
and bourne where is he now
dead in a ditch
drunk in a bar in mogadishu
who knows
i think i do
i had a deal going down
in berlin last week
during the buy both our case officer
and the seller were killed
they were killed by jason bourne
theyre ready for us upstairs
seven years ago
20 million of cia funds disappeared
during a wire transfer through moscow
in the investigation that followed
we were contacted by
a russian politician vladimir neski
neski claimed we had a leak
and that wed been ripped off
by one of our own
and were we
we never found out
we were negotiating a meet
with mr neski when he was killed
by who
his wife
the case had gone cold until a month ago
when we found a source
another russian in berlin
who claimed to have access
to the neski murder files
we thought we had
another bite at the apple
turns out the assassin
was one of our ownjason bourne
i know treadstones not
a very popular subject around here
but we found some interesting things
when we dug a little deeper
this is conklins personal computer
his treadstone files are bloated
with code keys and case files that
he neither needed nor had clearance for
buried in the hard drive
we found a deleted file with
an account number to a bank in zurich
at the time of his death
he was sitting on a personal account
in the amount of760000
you know what his budget was
we were throwing money at him
and asking him to keep it dark
it was his own account
he was up to something
this is supposed to be definitive
whats definitive is that
i just lost two people in berlin
so whats your theory
conklins reaching out from the grave
to protect his good name
the man is dead
no ones disputing that ward
for christs sake marty you knew conklin
does this scan i mean at all
cut to the chase pam
i think that bourne and conklin
were in business together
that bournes still involved
and that whatever information
i was trying to buy in berlin
was big enough to bring bourne
out from hiding to kill again
hows that scan
excuse me sir
but youre not gonna believe this
jason bournes passport
just popped up on the grid in naples
okay contact naples
they need to know
who theyre dealing with
find out what kind of local assets
we have in place there
nah its nothing some guys name
came up on the computer
yeah hey listen tom
im gonna call you back okay
all right
mr bourne im john nevins
im with the us consulate
i just have a few questions for you
youre coming out of tangier
is that correct
whats the uh nature
of your visit to naples
look i dont know what you did
and i dont know
who youre working for
but i promise you this
youre gonna play ball
one way or the other
this is nevins
this is tom cronin ci operations officer
calling from langley virginia
do you have a jason bourne in custody
yes i do
listen hes an agency priority target
call me back
as soon as hes secure
i understand
hes been detained
heres the number
hes being interrogated by
a field officer out of the consulate
hello
this is pamela landy ci supervisor
where do we stand
i uh think he got away
damn it
have you locked down the area
locked it down no no
this is uh this is italy
they dont exactly lock down
how long have you
worked for the agency
me for four years
if you ever wanna make it to five
youre gonna listen to me real close
bourne is armed and extremely dangerous
last week in berlin
he assassinated two men
one a highly experienced field officer
i want you to secure that area
i want any evidence secured
and i want it done right now
is that clear
yes sir maam
im getting on a plane to berlin
in 45 minutes which means
youre gonna call me back in 30
and when i ask you where west and
i had better be impressed
berlin
i already have a team in place there
i doubt that bournes in naples
ready to start a family
you have no idea
what youre getting into
do you have any idea
from the minute he left treadstone
hes killed and eluded every single person
that youve sent to find him
you read a couple of files on jason bourne
and that makes you an expert
this is my case ward
enough i want you both
on that plane
we are all of us going to do
what we were either too lazy
or inept to do the last time around
were gonna find this son of a bitch
and take him down
i m not having jason bourne
destroy any more of this agency
is that definitive enough for you
yes
jason bourne
is armed and extremely dangerous
last week in berlin
he assassinated two men
one a highly experienced field officer
i want that area
he assassinated two men
one a highly experienced field officer
i want that area secured
i want any evidence secured
and i want it done right now
this is not a drill soldier
this is not a drill soldier
this is not a drill soldier
we clear on that
we clear on that
youd been working at treadstone
for three years
and your cover at the time was what
that i was an american student in paris
and what exactly did your job
with treadstone in paris consist of
i had two responsibilities
one was to coordinate
logistical operations
the other was to monitor
the health of the agents
health meaning what
their mental health
because of what they had been through
they were prone to a variety of problems
what kind
depression anger
compulsive behaviors
they had physical symptoms
headaches sensitivity to light
amnesia

maybe hes running
on his own passport
what is he actually doing
hes making his first mistake
its not a mistake

theres always an objective
always a target
the objective and targets
always came from us
