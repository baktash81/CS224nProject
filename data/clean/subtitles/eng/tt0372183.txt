  we don t have a choice 
yes  you do 
thank you 
two of these explosive charges
placed on the power lines 
and one of them failed 
the fingerprints from the one
that didn t go off 
  and the germans can t match it 
  no  nobody s got it 
we checked out every database we could access 
but we re hooked into langley now 
run it 
okay 
what the hell s treadstone 
all right  get me a flight 
we re going to langley 
two men dead 
three million in cash gone 
no neski files 
and all very public 
this is still a clandestine agency  no 
i don t view this event
as a failure 
you call it a success 
we have a lead 
a fingerprint left by the assassin 
he s one of us 
  who is it 
  what can you tell me
about treadstone 
treadstone 
it s where the trail dead ends 
if you want an answer 
you re going to have to give me   
a level five s c i  access 
we have a lead  marty 
all right 
you ve got your clearance 
but you re on
a very short leash 
and you ll give a full report
to the group  i wanna know
where you re going with this 
sir 
ward 
yes 
pamela landy 
hey  pam 
what can i do for you 
i was hoping you had
some time for me 
time for what 
  i m free right now  actually 
  that sounds ominous 
let me check my schedule 
excuse me 
i need to  uh  
excuse me  can i help you 
yeah  i m here to see mr  abbott 
twenty minutes 
see ya 
operation treadstone 
never heard of it 
that s not gonna fly 
with all due respect  pam  i think you
might ve wandered past your pay grade 
that s a warrant from director marshall
granting me unrestricted access to   
all personnel and materials
associated with treadstone 
so  what are we looking at 
i wanna know about it 
know about it 
it was a kill squad 
black on black 
we closed it down two years ago 
nobody wants to know about treadstone 
not around here 
so i think you better take this
back to marty and let him know
exactly what you re doing 
he does 
i ve been down to the archives 
i have the files  ward 
  let s talk about conklin 
  what are you after  pam 
you wanna fry me 
you want my desk  is that it 
i wanna know what happened 
what happened 
jason bourne happened 
you got the files 
then let s cut the crap 
conklin had these guys wound so tight 
they were bound to snap 
bourne was his number one 
the guy went for a job  screwed the op 
never came back 
conklin couldn t fix it 
couldn t find bourne  couldn t adjust 
it all went sideways 
so you had conklin killed 
i mean  if we re cutting the crap 
i ve given 30 years
and two marriages to this agency 
i ve shoveled shit on four continents 
i m due to retire next year 
but if you think i m gonna sit here
and let you dangle me with this 
you can go to hell    and marshall too 
it had to be done 
  and bourne  where is he now 
  dead in a ditch 
  drunk in a bar in mogadishu 
who knows 
  i think i do 
i had a deal going down
in berlin last week 
during the buy  both our case officer
and the seller were killed 
they were killed by jason bourne 
they re ready for us upstairs 
seven years ago 
 20 million of c i a  funds disappeared
during a wire transfer through moscow 
in the investigation that followed 
we were contacted by
a russian politician  vladimir neski 
neski claimed we had a leak
and that we d been ripped off
by one of our own 
and were we 
we never found out 
we were negotiating a meet
with mr  neski when he was killed 
  by who 
  his wife 
the case had gone cold until a month ago
when we found a source 
another russian in berlin
who claimed to have access
to the neski murder files 
we thought we had
another bite at the apple 
turns out the assassin
was one of our own  jason bourne 
i know treadstone s not
a very popular subject around here 
but we found some interesting things
when we dug a little deeper 
this is conklin s personal computer 
his treadstone files are bloated
with code keys and case files that
he neither needed nor had clearance for 
buried in the hard drive 
we found a deleted file with
an account number to a bank in zurich 
at the time of his death 
he was sitting on a personal account
in the amount of 760 000 
you know what his budget was 
we were throwing money at him
and asking him to keep it dark 
  it was his own account 
he was up to something 
 this is supposed to be definitive 
what s definitive is that
i just lost two people in berlin 
so what s your theory 
conklin s reaching out from the grave
to protect his good name 
the man is dead 
  no one s disputing that  ward 
  for christ s sake  marty  you knew conklin 
does this scan  i mean  at all 
cut to the chase  pam 
i think that bourne and conklin
were in business together 
that bourne s still involved
and that whatever information
i was trying to buy in berlin   
was big enough to bring bourne
out from hiding to kill again 
how s that scan 
excuse me  sir 
but you re not gonna believe this 
jason bourne s passport
just popped up on the grid in naples 
okay  contact naples 
they need to know
who they re dealing with 
find out what kind of local assets
we have in place there 
nah  it s nothing  some guy s name
came up on the computer 
yeah  hey  listen  tom 
i m gonna call you back  okay 
all right 
mr  bourne  i m john nevins 
i m with the u s  consulate 
i just have a few questions for you 
you re coming out of tangier 
is that correct 
what s the  uh  nature
of your visit to naples 
look  i don t know what you did 
and i don t know
who you re working for 
but i promise you this  
you re gonna play ball
one way or the other 
this is nevins 
this is tom cronin  c i  operations officer
calling from langley  virginia 
  do you have a jason bourne in custody 
  yes  i do 
listen  he s an agency priority target 
call me back
as soon as he s secure 
i understand 
he s been detained 
here s the number 
he s being interrogated by
a field officer out of the consulate 
  hello 
  this is pamela landy  c i  supervisor 
where do we stand 
i  uh  think he got away 
damn it 
  have you locked down the area 
  locked it down  no  no 
this is  uh   this is italy 
they don t exactly lock down  
  how long have you
worked for the agency 
  me  for four years 
if you ever wanna make it to five 
you re gonna listen to me real close 
bourne is armed and extremely dangerous 
last week in berlin
he assassinated two men  
one a highly experienced field officer 
i want you to secure that area 
i want any evidence secured 
and i want it done right now 
is that clear 
yes  sir   ma am 
i m getting on a plane to berlin
in 45 minutes  which means
you re gonna call me back in 30 
and when i ask you where west and 
i had better be impressed 
  berlin 
  i already have a team in place there 
i doubt that bourne s in naples
ready to start a family 
  you have no idea
what you re getting into 
  do you have any idea 
from the minute he left treadstone 
he s killed and eluded every single person
that you ve sent to find him 
you read a couple of files on jason bourne 
and that makes you an expert 
this is my case  ward 
enough  i want you both
on that plane 
we are  all of us  going to do
what we were either too lazy
or inept to do the last time around 
we re gonna find this son of a bitch
and take him down 
i  m not having jason bourne
destroy any more of this agency 
  is that definitive enough for you 
  yes 
jason bourne
is armed and extremely dangerous 
last week in berlin
he assassinated two men  
one a highly experienced field officer 
i want that area  
   he assassinated two men  
one a highly experienced field officer 
i want that area secured 
i want any evidence secured 
and i want it done right now  
this is not a drill  soldier 
this is not a drill  soldier 
this is not a drill  soldier 
we clear on that 
we clear on that 
you d been working at treadstone
for three years 
and your cover at the time was what 
that i was an american student in paris 
and what exactly did your job
with treadstone in paris consist of 
i had two responsibilities 
one was to coordinate
logistical operations 
the other was to monitor
the health of the agents 
health  meaning what 
their mental health 
  because of what they had been through 
they were prone to a variety of problems 
  what kind 
depression  anger 
compulsive behaviors 
they had physical symptoms 
headaches  sensitivity to light 
  amnesia 
  before bourne  no 
the plane s ready 
there s a car waiting for you

it s uploading right now 
it s coming in now 
  i need clearance 
  he s not hiding  that s for sure 
  why naples  why now 
  could be random 
  maybe he s running 
  on his own passport 
  what is he actually doing 
  he s making his first mistake 
it s not a mistake 
they don t make mistakes 
they don t do random 
there s always an objective 
always a target 
the objective and targets
always came from us 
who s giving them to him now 
scary version

  i emptied it 
  it felt a little light 
put it down
