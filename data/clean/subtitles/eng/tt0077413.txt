attempt frame mademoiselle jackie
see mes amis friends
though lack suspects among
might killed someone trying shut defamatory mouth
someone whose father ruined madame doyles father
someone obsessed idea robbery
someone bitterly resented anyone inheriting amount money
someone desperately trying save mother
financial ruin
yet
someone anxious escape exposure fraudulent trustee
someone simply mistook identity victim
remembered something important
night killing slept heavily
lightly custom
wine drugged
someone wish present nights events
easiest thing world
bottles stand open dining room table day long
mon colonel even sent bottle back
saying use words mouldy
plainly implies premeditation someones part
means yesterday dinner served
crime already decided upon
began think back something puzzling beginning
intention implicate mademoiselle jackie
gun removed madame doyles cabin
understood
murderer removed gun remove
course
dr bessner examined madame doyles body
ja
remember signs scorching round wound
words
gun placed close head fired
correct
recovered gun nile
wrapped brocade stole
evidently fired folds
presumably order deaden sound shot
dr bessner fired stole
would scorching madame doyles temple
words shot killed madame doyle could fired
stole
perhaps one
one jacqueline de bellefort fired simon doyle
jackie
witness know
therefore third shot
one know nothing
two shots missing gun
next curious circumstance occurred madame doyles cabin
found two bottles coloured nail polish
one bottle labelled rose drops remaining bottle
pale pink bright red
instead usual smell pear drops vinegar
mes amis red ink formed inevitable link
handkerchief found
together gun wrapped stole
ink washes easily linen leaving pale pink stain
something happened put matter beyond doubt
louise bourget killed blackmailing murderer
know fragment thousand franc note
found clutched dead fingers
also rather curious words used

tell herr doyle
could moved boat fractured leg
tell ludwig bessner
would testify court world
case would say testimony irrelevant
irrelevant unanwendbar
unanwendbar
testified
complex psychological cases century
testimony alone saved strutzrumple
dresden sachertorte murderer execution
case calmezvous calmezvous
testimony irrelevant started tend monsieur doyle
five minutes shot
tell could moved five minutes
agree hed shot time
consider actually seen
mademoiselle rosalie saw jacqueline fire pistol
saw doyle collapse ﬂoor turning away seek help
ran monsieur ferguson heard shot
saw doyle clutching redstained handkerchief leg
quite naturally assumed doyle shot
assumption wrong
bullet gone doyle elsewhere
happens
doyle insists jackie taken away cabin left alone
jackie helped cabin
mademoiselle rosalie monsieur ferguson
mademoiselle rosalie goes fetch miss bowers
accordingly activity centred
starboard side boat
miss bowers
two minutes doyle needs
takes shoes picks gun sofa
jackie thoughtfully thrown
would forgotten later
runs like hare along port deck
enters wifes cabin
doyle takes madame van schuylers stole previously hidden
wrapping gun
order muffle sound prevent scorching
fires bullet leg
removes one spent cartridges disposes
inserts fresh one thus indicating gun found
two bullets fired
rewraps gun stole adds stained handkerchief
marble ashtray make sure sinks bottom
throws whole bundle window nile
lies back sofa
clasping fresh handkerchief leg
time genuine agony
cest extraordinaire nestce pas
impossible scarcely believe
course absolutely bloody impossible
say impossible
told heard softly running feet
reason anyone run
yes know spur moment
mon colonel spur moment
carefully planned
doyle oh doyle merely acted part
planned accomplice mademoiselle jacqueline de bellefort

im mad thats truth
gave doyle alibi firing shot
gave alibi
doyle insistingb someone stay night
true
true bother deny
doyle lovers still lovers
plan simon would kill wife inherit money
aftewvards later date marry old love
brilliant concept
persecution madame doyle simons feigned rage
selection mademoiselle rosalie witness
buildup shooting exaggerated hysteria
one risk really took
simons wound simply disabling
oh er pardon one piece foolishness
drawing letter j wall cabin
melodramatic could one effect
exonerating
would want except accomplice
plan began go wrong
louise bourget wakeful
sees doyle run wifes cabin
hears shot sees return saloon
makes greedy bid hush money
signs death wanant
herr doyle could killed could moved
swear would right
