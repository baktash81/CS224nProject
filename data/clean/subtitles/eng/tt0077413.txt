decapitated clergyman

you were a trifle lucky
to find that cake knife
up the chimney  like that 
lucky  with me it s the exercise
of the little grey cells 
luck  i leave to the others 
yes  i d forgotten
your opinions about yourself 
might one ask 
what are you doing here 
i m on les  vacances 
 vacation

i m observing the decline
of the capitalist system  my friend 
oh  indeed 
well  you ve got
a good specimen there  eh 
the young kaugummi heiress 
 chewing gum 
that parasite 
  you don t approve 
  she makes me sick 
in any decent society   
ah  you may be right 
she has altogether too much power 
  monsieur 
  shukran jazeelan   thanks v  much 
 cin cin   it 
  linnet  linnet  honey 
  uncle andrew 
what a surprise  i didn t know
you were travelling in egypt 
well  it s very sudden  as a matter
of fact  i m on my honeymoon 
your honeymoon  what do you know 
is this the lucky young man 
darling  this is my american lawyer
and trustee  andrew pennington 
simon  simon doyle 
  pleased to meet you  sir 
  how do you do 
  won t you join us 
  well  just for a moment 
but don t worry 
i m not going to intrude 
i know how young people are 
the  cynosure of all eyes 
 focal point 
even you  with your english reserve 
gaze 
  she s very beautiful 
  oh  she s very rich 
you know who she is  of course 
  of course    yes 
do forgive me for butting in 
but i have a bet with my daughter here 
that you re hercules porridge 
the famous french sleuth 
not quite  i am hercule poirot 
the famous  belgian  sleut h   
i told you  rosalie 
there s only one monsieur poirot
in the world  he s unmistakable 
as indeed  i realise i am  myself 
my mother is salome otterbourne 
the novelist 
otter    salo    of course 
natrellement  enchant√© 
so here we are 
two famous people in one plaoe 
  oh  three  surely 
i was talking about genius 
not mere money  monsieur 
oh  you know colonel race 
my old friend 
this is    and her daughter   
charmed  simply charmed 
please  sit down  madame  mademoiselle 
voila 
you re probably working on
some other book now  madame 
set in egypt  perhaps 
how thrillingly clever of you
to deduce that  monsieur porridge 
i am here to absorb local colour
for my grand opus 
snow on the sphinx  face 
frozen enigma turns
to incandescent love
as this young english girl from
haslemere  scarcely out of school 
melts the barbarous heart
of a cruel desert sheikh 
somehow  i don t think
monsieur poirot
is a very keen reader
of romantic novels  mother 
of course he is  all frenchmen are 
they re not afraid of good  strong sex 
unlike  i might say  most of
our leading lending libraries 
they have banned
salome otterbourne
for speaking the truth
about men and women 
but she goes on  nonetheless 
the truth  yes  the truth 
it s so difficult to tell 
thank you  monsieur 
well  perhaps you would
join me in a tango  er  mademoiselle 
a little exercise after dinner 
  do you tango  colonel 
  poorly  i m afraid  mrs  otterbourne 
then i shall teach you
to do it correctly 
as it was done in old spain 
when it was known as the  cheeker  
that is to say 
with a sensuous  erotic dash 
damn it  jackie 
can t you leave us alone 
waiter 
monsieur poirot 
monsieur poirot 
i saw you with linnet
this morning 
how much is she paying you
to warn me off 
no  no  i accepted no commission
from madame doyle  nor will i 
what i have to say to you
is in pure friendship 
oh  yes  and what would
you like to say 
that i m making a public show of myself 
that i m crazy 
i say bury the dead 
not as the egyptians do 
preserving the body in order to ensure
the immortality of the soul 
no  properly  finally 
turn your back on the past 
look only fonlvard 
remember  time heals everything 
if you think i m suffering 
you re quite wrong 
actually  i m rather
enjoying myself 
yes  your pleasure is the very worst
part of it  mademoiselle 
i don t care 
simon was mine and he loved me 
then she came along and   
it s only a tiny thing   
   but it s lethal 
and my father taught me
to be a crack shot 
sometimes  i swear i ll put this gun
right against her head 
and then ever so gently
pull the trigger 
when i hear that sound
more and more   
i know how you feel 
we all feel like that at times 
only  i warn you  mademoiselle   
do not allow evil into your heart 
it will make a home there 
if love can t live there 
evil will do just as well 
oh  how    how sad  mademoiselle 
hello  mr  p  
  you re going back to the hotel 
  where else 
look  it s a surprise for linnet 
do you think she ll like it 
  that depends  does she smoke 
  just craven  a  
by the way    have you had a chance
to talk to jackie yet 
yes  just a few moments ago 
well  good  i hope you got
her to see some sense 
alas  to her 
sense is perpetual revenge 
  are you serious 
  i m always serious  mon ami 
jackie s stubborn  i know 
and damn possessive 
  but surely   
  did she want to possess you 
well  i suppose so  yes  she did 
but she has a hell of a temper
and a mind of her own 
she wishes to wear the trousers 
yes  and a man can t have that 
can he  mr  p  
no  no  ne peut pas 
you know  when i first met linnet   
well  how should i put it 
it was like the moon after sunrise  you
just don t notice it s there any more 
after i met her 
jackie just didn t exist 
yes  some women have that power 
but how are you going to find
a way out of your present dilemma 
well  i have the most marvellous plan
and it s absolutely foolproof 
cabby 
the railway station  quickly 
we re late for the alexandria train 
the railway station 
fast as you can 
haare ka 
   foghorn 
thank you 
look  there she is 
welcome  welcome  welcome 
welcome aboard the kamak  yes 
my name is mr  choudry 
i am the manager of this boat
and your delight and happiness
is my sole concern and pleasure 
quite rightly 
i have here    i have here   
yes  i have here a list of names and 
er    and  er    staterooms 
i guess from your faces
which is which  ok 
er    you are mrs  and
miss otterbourne 
  righty 
  wrong y 
i m mrs  van schuyler
and i wish to be taken
to my cabin immediately 
bowers will have the cabin opposite 
on the starboard side 
the roasting afternoon sun
may do wonders
for those jaundiced jowls of hers 
right away  madam  right away 
yes  you must be dr  bessner 
such elegant german moustaches 
i m afraid you d never make
a detective  monsieur 
the moustaches  although
undeniably elegant  are belgian 
my name is poirot  hercule poirot 
ah  the famous monsieur poirot 
i grovel in mortification 
i grovel 
look  wouldn t it just be simpler
for us to give you our names
and you to give us
the cabins that we booked 
simpler  ah  lummy  yes 
unquestionably simpler  unquestionably 
such a brilliant lack
of complication 
in a trice  the safragi will
conduct you all to your stateroom 
 safragi  saf     servant 
ah  we start 
may i suggest that you all take
your last look at the city 
safra    safragi 
well  we ve done it 
we got rid of her  at last 
what did you expect 
you re a genius 
well  it s not bad
for the simple simon 
fabulous  isn t it 
you re the ridgeway girl 
aren t you 
and you re mrs  van schuyler 
i wondered if we d ever break the ice 
well  i seldom talk to strangers 
but never to strange honeymooners 
  i m glad you re breaking your rule 
  well  rules are made to be broken 
at least  mine are  by me 
  oh  they re beautiful 
  thank you 
and amazing 
if you know how they re made 
a tiny piece of grit makes
its way into an oyster
which eventually becomes
a pearl of great price
hanging round the neck
of a pretty girl like you 
  i never thought of it that way 
  well  you should 
the oyster nearly dies 
come along now  back to the cabin 
time for your massage 
my companion  bowers 
she did 15 rounds once
with jack dempsey 
he was never the same man again 
  sorry  miss ridgeway 
  mrs  doyle  mrs  simon doyle 
you have got to forgive miss bowers 
she s just unfamiliar
with the married state 
  i saw you drooling over her pearls 
  shut up  bowers 
you d give every tooth in your head
to lay your hands on them 
what nonsense 
just because you ve got a grudge against her 
or rather her father  no need to be uncivil 
grudge  
melhuish ridgeway ruined my family 
well  you should be grateful 
if he hadn t  you d have missed
the pleasure of working for me 
i could kill her on that score alone 
tea  madame 
i am salome otterbourne
and i must have a word 
i thought we were already having words 
through our lawyers 
it is about that
that i have come to supplicate 
supplicate 
i mean to entreat  or to appeal 
if you like 
i m afraid we authors are
a little Ô¨Çowery in our speech 
and defamatory in our writing 
i m sorry you should have taken
passion under the persimmon tree that way 
i assure you the intention was
merely to show a young girl s heart
beginning to beat
to the primordial drum 
can t you see  my dear  that what
i wrote was really quite Ô¨Çattering 
frankly  mrs  otterbourne 
i don t consider being likened
to a nymphomaniacal baboon  Ô¨Çattering 
and i suggest we leave it to our lawyers
to decide what is adequate compensation
for being the butt
of your vulgar drivel 
  good afternoon 
  philistine 
i ll show you what reputation
is about 
  i m sorry to intrude 
  uncle andrew 
but these are the papers 
i told you  needed signing 
the lease on the chrysler building   
ah  let s see  the silver mine
concessions  baku oil transfers
and the corn crisp choo chew merger 
just sign on the last page 
right on the bottom  my dear 
but  uncle andrew 
i haven t even read it yet 
there s no need  there s no need 
it s all quite straightforward 
checked and double checked by me 
but i always read everything
through before i sign 
my father taught me that 
he always said never to trust anyone 
not even your own lawyers 
dear old melhuish 
what a sense of humour 
well  as far as i m concerned  i ve
never read a legal document in my life 
i certainly don t intend to start now 
you don t say 
  isn t that a little feckless  darling 
  yes  absolutely 
but i m dying for a manhattan 
aren t you 
alright 
seeing we re on our honeymoon 
that s a girl 
now  the next one 
i do hope i m not  er  butting in 
i m a lawyer 
i just wanted to say how much i admire
your businesslike attitude 
your father was absolutely right  never
sign a document until you ve read it 
i m sure you agree  sir 
er  sure  sure  there s no hurry 
well  now  if you ll excuse me 
i hope i ve not given offence 
what if you have  mr    
  race  colonel race 
  what if you have  colonel 
lawyers are trained
to deal with offences 
would you join us for a drink
in the bar 
  thank you  most kind 
  and what about you  mr  p  
after all 
there s cause for celebration 
as you see  my plan to lose jackie
worked like a charm 
yes  so it would  er   
so it would seem 
congratulations 
  mes f√©licitations  
colonel race and
will join you in a  er   
   moment 
darling 
  madame  i must talk with you 
  later  louise 
  no  now  it s important 
  i ll see you in the bar 
  well 
  i ve received a cable 
my fianc√© has sent his woman
back to her people 
he s waiting for me 
i must go to him 
please  give me the money
that you promised me 
i ve been with you for five years now 
  it s completely out of the question 
  madame  you promised me 
  he s still married  louise 
  i implore you 
i need that money as a dowry 
i ve worked hard for you 
and you ll continue to do so
until i say otherwise 
  madame  you can t refuse me 
  thank you  louise 
 chameau   camel  
 mon dieu  how she makes
enemies of them all   my god 
even her own lawyer
is trying to cheat her 
you old fox  so you noticed 
well  i knew that you weren t here   
how was it again 
 seulement pour les vacances 
mon ami   mock accent 
yes  i suppose i can tell you 
 sub rosa  i am working
for mrs  doyle s english lawyers 
and they suspect andrew pennington
of    well  of   
  embezzling her money 
  that s about the size of it 
you see  under the terms
of the father s will 
she gets control of the money when
she marries  and as she has recently married   
he is trying to get her
to sign a document
which will get him out of the soup 
exactly  i think i ve scared him off
for the moment 
but who knows what he ll try next 
or any of them  for that matter 
 inside the great temple of karnak 
we pass the pedestals
of numerous small rams   ja 
 each with a small image
of amenophis iii in front of it   yeah 
oh  yes  rams 
lickerish  priapic  ruttish rams 
how noble they are 
with their proud Ô¨Çanks  Ô¨Çared nostrils
and unashamed curled horns 
ja  ja  
come  fraulein  come 
you know  karl marx said that
religion was the opium of the people 
for your mother 
it s obviously sex 
don t you think you d better
calm her down a little 
she d do one of those beasts
a fearful injury 
look  mr  ferguson  my mother
may be a figure of fun for you 
but she still happens to be my mother 
she kept me marvellously in better days 
i m not going to desert her now that   
  now that what 
  nothing 
i m sorry 
i didn t mean to be nosy 
and i certainly didn t mean
to offend you 
honestly  miss otlerbourne 
i am not as bad as i look 
  aren t you 
  scout s honour 
  would you mind offending her 
  linnet ridgeway s a leech 
a parasite on the skin of society 
for god s sake  in a sane world 
she d be bumped off
as a warning to the others 
  bumped off 
  that s what i said 
  mr  ferguson 
  jim 
jim  is it true
you can t libel the dead 
i m not sure i understand the question 
never mind 
oh  look  isn t it wonderful 
quite beyond comprehension 
ah  the artistic temperament 
monsieur pennington 
what strange forms it takes 
i m afraid that doesn t much
concern me  monsieur poirot 
i confine myself
to the world of facts and figures 
the ancient egyptians felt
quite at home with facts and figures 
the grand vizier ptahhotep
was crushed to death
under a thousand pieces of silver
because he embezzled
his master s treasury 
  you don t say 
  oh  yes 
god  you alright 
linnet  you alright 
come on  easy 
that s it  come on  up you come 
alright 
what happened 
that stone must have fallen
or was pushed 
  to kill me 
  jackie 
but she s not here 
oh  my poor madame 
that was a close shave 
  it could ve been a nasty accident 
  accident 
that stone has been up there
for 4 000 years 
it chooses the moment to fall  when
there are people underneath it  no 
not exactly 4 000 years  herr poirot 
  these pillars were built in 1788   
  we all agree with you  herr bessner 
you may have a patient on your hands 
please 
oh  most negligent of me 
ja  ja  here 
i m alright  really i am 
ja  ja  but i think maybe you go back
to the boat  you take a little rest  eh 
alright  but only for a
couple of hours  doctor 
i must see the temple of abu simbel
this evening 
oh  that is most extraordinary 
did you know that the easternmost figure
is the famous vocal statue 
  really 
  ja 
then we must be there in time 
thank you  doctor 
at sunset it emits a sad 
plaintive note 
  he scares me 
  oh  he s harmless 
my god  it s fantastic 
i think they re frightening 
no  they re not 
do you think he ll sing
a note for me 
why not  you re divine 
welcome to the temple of abu simbel 
the facade is 84 feet long 
each of the statues of ramesses ii
is 65 feet high 
get away from me  get away 
get away from me 
ok  darling 
don t let her spoil everything 
so you could not bury your dead 
you cannot stay away 
nope  i can t keep away 
you didn t really think i d be fooled
by any trick simon could invent 
i m very sorry to see you here 
mademoiselle 
forgive me for saying so 
but you re embarking on
a hazardous journey in troubled waters 
you face who knows
what currents of misfortune 
  why do you say that 
  because it s the truth 
you re cutting the last bonds
which bind you to safety 
you can still turn back
if you really want to 
one must follow one s star
wherever it leads 
  even to disaster 
  even to hell itself 
i left my bag in the bar 
i ll join you in a minute  darling 
well    we are alone  mein frau 
the opportunity to talk to you in
private has not presented itself before 
  what do we have to talk about 
  my reputation  frau doyle 
  you ran that institute in zurich 
  that is so 
and you have been saying
so many unpleasant things about me
to people of influence
and position 
  i say you re a quack 
  frau doyle 
    what s more  you re a dangerous quack 
  now  listen to me 
my good friend myra seligman
listened to you  too well 
and allowed you to give her
those filthy injections 
i prescribed a course
of armadillo urine 
ja  i had used it previously
with great success 
in the case of poor myra 
she went barking mad  thanks to you 
i will not allow this 
these irresponsible remarks
about my treatment have got to stop 
then sue me  if you dare 
now  you know that is impossible 
any scandal attached to my clinic
would bring instant ruin 
then it s rather your funeral 
isn t it 
well  let s hope that
it is not yours 
do you want a cr√®me de cacao
or a cognac  perhaps 
the service upstairs is so slow 
nein    danke 
what time is it 
there s a clock  use your eyes 
didn t your mother ever tell you 
as far as servants are concerned 
there is a vast difference
between amiable eccentricity
and downright rudeness 
my mother was a lady 
a disposition she failed
to pass on to you 
it s your bedtime 
  very well  where s my stole 
  i haven t seen it 
  you sure you had it with you 
  of course i m sure 
  well  i haven t seen it anywhere 
  use your eyes 
monsieur poirot 
i hope one day you ll be able
to tell me about some of your cases 
the    the juicier ones 
  juicier ones 
  bloodier 
ah  quand vous voulez  madame 
  goodnight  goodnight  monsieur 
  bon soir 
  oh  so sorry 
  oh  no  no  no 
you look very sleepy tonight 
monsieur porridge 
yes  i m extremely 
i am consumed by sleep  madame 
i don t know why  but i can hardly

i ve always found it very effective
when mrs  van schuyler is carrying on

that hun doctor from next door 
  he ought to have a look at doyle 
  yes  right 
bad  this 
get me one more cloth  ja

are you afraid of a little blood
like a young  m√§dchen   girl 
come here  ferguson  help me get him up 
i ll stay with her tonight  you never
know how they re going to react 
  miss bowers  is she quiet 
  yes 
yes  i ve given her some morphia 
i won t leave her 
ah  good 
young lady  you come with me  ja 
you ll be more use than
this  stutzer  dandy  here 
who s afraid at the sight
of a little blood 
open the door  ja 
easy  alright  alright  that s it 
almost    here we are  ja 
ja 
alright  could you get
a cool towel for the head  ja 
yes  doctor 
  ja 
  i d better go and pick up that gun 
it s not the sort of thing we want
to leave lying around  is it 
  ja 
  yes 
jackie  she mustn t be left alone 
she isn t  don t worry 
oh  god  it s all been my fault 
i treated her so badly 
she didn t know what she was doing 
she was drunk 
now  this is going to hurt 
are you sure someone
shouldn t tell your wife 
yes  yes  please 
no    no  let her sleep 
no need to worry her till morning 
the best i can do is patch it up 
there is no exit wound 
the bullet is lodged deep in there 
ja  it will have to wait
until we get to wadi halfa 
roll up the sleeve 
 get 
and swab it with this  eh 
ja  i will have some splints made 
and then i will set them
when you are asleep  eh 
  thank you  doctor 
  ja  now  don t you worry 
everything s going to be alright 
it s not there 
   was   what 
  the gun  it s not there 
but who could have taken it 
search me 
i only hope it s not important 
 sometimes i want to put
this little gun up to her head 
and very gently pull the trigger  
   was   what 
  oh  nothing 
i ve just seen the manager 
he put the matter in my hands
so it ll be our responsibility
until we reach wadi haifa 
well  i am at your disposal 
of course    thank you 
so  doctor  what can you
tell us about this 
she was shot with a very small bullet 
a  22 calibre  i think  and the gun was
held very close to the head 
here you can see all the  versengen 
damn it  man  can t you speak english 
  oh  you mean the scorching 
  ja  ja  the scorching 
excuse me 
 tiens  tiens  tiens   
 well  well  well 
  what do you make of that 
  huh 
oh  i think it s    i think it s easy 
you see  madame doyle was dying 
she wished to identify
the murderer to us 
and therefore she dipped her finger
in her own blood 
she wrote  j  on the wall   jacqueline  
oh  what you say is dumb 
the lady dies instantly 
  really 
  ja 
there is no time for writing
with the finger in blood 
  no  no 
  oh  you make a joke 
well  it s a very small one 
not in very good taste  i m afraid 
the fact remains the  j  is on the wall 
now it s up to us to explain why 
it seems a gesture
which is childishly melodramatic 
  doctor  what about the time of death 
  well   
she has been dead at least six hours 
no longer than eight 
that puts it between midnight
and 2 am 
  which is extraordinary 
  why is that 
because it means quite simply
that mademoiselle jacqueline
could not have done it 
you told me yourself 
 mon colonel 
that madame doyle left the observation
saloon a little before 11 45 
to go to bed 
and from then on  jackie was in view
either of mademoiselle rosalie
and monsieur doyle
or of monsieur ferguson
and mademoiselle bowers 
who injected her with morphia and
stayed with her in her cabin all night 
and simon doyle is also eliminated
by reason of his broken leg 
i don t suppose he could ve walked
very far with that wound 
not one step  i assure you 
excellent  let s hope the process
of elimination continues as smoothly 
i am afraid it will not  mon colonel 
after all  everyone on this boat knew
exactly why mademoiselle jacqueline
hated madame doyle 
she was a natural for what
the americans would call a  frame up  
at least  mein herr 
you cannot suspect me 
oh  why not 
you had a very good reason to kill her 
as i discovered last night 
oh  then you did overhear 
but that was no motive 
i mean  i could have sued her 
  and risk ruin  murder is cheaper 
  and safer  if you don t get caught 
but i could not have done such a thing 
i disagree 
at the time of the shooting
of monsieur doyle 
you could have been on deck 
perhaps unable to sleep 
you could have heard
the sound of voices 
looked through the window
of the saloon  seen what happened   
  go to bed 
  you can t treat me like this 
now look  jackie 
i ll kill you first 
jackie 
and remembered
the position of the gun 
later  when you were
called from your cabin 
you could have picked up the gun
while you were tending monsieur doyle 
later still  when all was quiet 
you could have left your cabin 
unobserved by your sleeping patient 
and gone to madame doyle s cabin
and shot her 
no  herr doctor 
i cannot rule you out 
what you are suggesting is  √ºberm√§ssig 
outrageous  ja 
no  i will not stay here
to be insulted 
found something in the nail varnish 
 you can t catch flies with vinegar 
on n attrape pas les mouches avec le vinaigre 
i beg your pardon 
it s an old french proverb 
which takes too long to explain 
come  my friend  let us prepare
ourselves for our investigation
of the paying customers 
how long was it  in your estimation 
between the time you and dr  bessner
carried monsieur doyle from the saloon
to when you returned
to look for the gun 
  oh  about three or four minutes 
  three or four minutes 
by your own admission  you were just outside
the saloon when the shooting took place 
in other words  it would have been
perfectly possible for you
to have noted the position of the gun 
i agree  perfectly possible 
perfectly possible also for you to have
waited until the saloon was empty 
then to have taken the gun
and only pretended not to have found it 
then  before returning
to dr  bessner to report its loss 
you could have used it
to kill madame doyle 
i could have done 
but as it happens  i didn t 
and you  mademoiselle 
you could have taken the gun
before you left here 
when monsieur ferguson
was helping monsieur doyle 
  i ll get miss bowers 
  yeah  right 
on your way to fetch miss bowers 
you could have seized the opportunity
to take the gun to madame doyle s cabin
and murder her 
it would have added only a minute
or two to the time that you were away 
miss bowers  wake up  miss bowers 
  what s that    could you please come
quickly  there s been an accident 
why should either of us
take the blasted gun 
we have no reason
to murder linnet doyle 
ah  but she was  a leech  
she was  a parasite
on the skin of society 
  who  deserved to be bumped off  
  well  yes  but   
oh  yes  monsieur   bumped off
as a warning to the others  
you damned froggy eavesdropper 
belgian  belgian   h eavesdropper 
if you please  sir 
and you  mademoiselle  you were eager
to save your mother great damages 
how could i possibly have done that 
you asked a question two days ago 
i will now answer it for you 
you are quite right  mademoiselle 
you cannot libel the dead 
i think you re horrid 
you pretend to be
so kind and considerate 
and all you want to do is trap us 
i must find out what lies hidden 
mademoiselle  the truth 
what it amounts to  then  is after
you gave miss jacqueline the morphia 
she never stirred all night 
exactly  nervous reaction  booze
and morphia 
together  they d have sunk the titanic 
so  unquestionably 
she could not have done the murder  
no  absolutely not 
no  but you could have 
  me 
  yes  you  mademoiselle 
let us suppose you were out on deck
at the time of the shooting
and saw what took place  and thus knew
where the gun was lying 
young lady  you come with me  ja 
you ll be more help
than this  stutzer here
who s scared at the sight
of a little blood 
while monsieur ferguson
and mademoiselle rosalie
were assisting dr  bessner 
you could have left your unconscious patient
and run in here to pick up the gun 
you would have had enough time
before monsieur ferguson returned
to search for it 
then you could have hurried down
the port side to madame doyle s cabin
and shot her 
preposterous 
why should i kill mrs  doyle 
because her father was
melhuish ridgeway 
whose unscrupulous business methods
ruined your father
and condemned you to a servant s life 
poppycock  from whom did you hear that 
from your own lips  mademoiselle 
three days ago 
how dare you listen
to a private conversation 
some voices carry 
is it true 
  yes  it is 
  voila 
but why should i kill mrs  doyle
for something that happened years ago 
because its effects are still
deeply resented by you to this day 
no  unfortunately  mademoiselle 
i cannot be persuaded
by your protestations 
to my mind  you had the means 
the motive  the opportunity 
and what is more 
the disposition to kill 
have you quite finished 
monsieur poirot 
for the time being 
but you will hold yourself ready
to answer further questions
should the need arise 
  i shall do no such thing 
  monsieur poirot 
  it is true about linnet 
  it is perfectly true 
i didn t kill her  i know
you all think i did  but i didn t 
 calmez vous  calmez vous  ma petite 
we know that you did not kill
madame doyle  we have proved it 
  proved 
  thank god 
what about simon  is he alright 
dr  bessner seems reasonably satisfied
with his condition  so far 
i was mad last night 
i might have killed him 
  do you think he ll ever forgive me 
  it s more than likely 
it s been my experience
that men are least attracted
to women who treat them well 
miss bowers  will you please escort miss jacqueline
to her cabin and see that she s alright 
we ll arrange a visit
to monsieur doyle later on 
oh  thank you 
i think you and i should visit him first 
he must be awake by now 
 bonne id√©e   good idea 
the thing which intrig   
   intrigues me most about
this case is the pistol 
  the pistol 
  why is it missing 
i fail to see why that is important 
in many cases
the murder weapon is missing 
even in a case
where a frame up is attempted  no 
why did the murderer go to the lengths
of writing  j  on the wall in blood 
and then removing j s gun 
yes  i see what you mean 
oh  they found something 
one thing is for certain 
madame doyle was not killed by a fish 
  are you alright 
  yes  thank you 
i must have just blacked out
for a moment 
try a spot of lunch 
it might give you some strength 
  no  thank you  i couldn t face it 
  you couldn t face it 
  do you permit that  er   
  please  do  help yourself 
i just can t believe that   
   that linnet s dead 
it s a bad knock 
i suppose it must look awfully black
against jackie 
but i just know she wouldn t
commit cold blooded murder 
no  rest assured  monsieur 
we know for a fact it was
not mademoiselle jackie 
thank god for that 
well  then  do you have any idea
who it might have been 
well  it could have been
practically anybody 
well  only yesterday
she was saying
everybody around her on this boat
was her enemy 
we have reason to believe
that she was right  monsieur 
monsieur   
oh  pardon 
i came to see if you were comfortable 
as comfortable as can be expected 
thank you  louise 
ah  the discoverer of the body 
you should be able to shed
some light on all this 
pardon 
you  you  you accuse me 
a respectable girl 
  i swear to you on my mother s grave   
   allons  allons  louise   come  come 
don t fuss so  just tell the truth
 pas tant d histoires  faut dire la v√©rit√© 
 asseyez vous   sit 
you can t suspect me
monsieur le detective  il faut pas se douter de moi 
poor mrs  doyle  everyone loved her
cette pauvre madame doyle  tout le monde l aimait 
so young  so beautiful 
elle √©tait si jeune  si belle 
no one would want to kill her 
il y a personne qui aurait voulu la tuer 
louise  don t joke  i ll   
louise  pas de blagues  je vous   
poirot  can we please keep this in some
language which we can all understand 
she said that all the world
loved madame doyle 
at least that s a fresh approach 
now then  when did you last see
mrs  doyle alive 
last night  monsieur  i was in her cabin
to undress her and put her to bed 
  and then where did you go 
  to my cabin  where else 
and you didn t see or hear anything
after that that might help us 
how could i  monsieur  my cabin
was on the other side of the boat 
naturally  if i d been unable to sleep 
if i d stayed on deck then 
perhaps i would have seen this assassin
enter and leave madame s cabin 
but as it is   
oh  monsieur  i implore you 
you see how it is 
  what else can i say 
  nobody s accusing you of anything 
new  don t worry  louise 
i ll look after you 
  monsieur is very good 
  but   
if you had not gone straight back to
your cabin after leaving madame doyle 
you would have had time
to witness the shooting
of monsieur doyle in the saloon 
  ah  non 
  ah   oui 
you could have walked on the deck 
seen everything 
then when the coast was clear 
you could have taken the gun   
   returned   
  and shot madame doyle 
monsieur  you accuse me unjustly 
why should i do such a wicked thing 
just answer me that 
oh  louise 
i know all about you 
and your love affair 
and madame doyle s objections
to your leaving her 
but i had no money and no references 
i had no choice but to stay 
 pr√©cis√©ment 
and how you hated her for that 
but i didn t kill her 
one final question  louise 
where are madame doyle s pearls 
her pearls 
she was wearing them last night 
she put them on the table by her bed 
  and were they there this morning 
   mon dieu  i didn t even look 
i went to her bed  i saw madame 
i cried out  and i ran out of the room 
you did not even look 
but i  hercule poirot 
have eyes which notice everything 
the pearls were not on
the dressing table this morning 
they had gone  vanished 
 disparues 
  we must find the gun 
  and the pearls 
yes  that should not prove
too difficult 
oh l√† l√†  q il fait  chaud 
it s hot  you re right 
yes  i could do with a change of shirt 
yes  let s  make a little pause
to freshen la  toilette 
  and to rest the little grey cells 
  i ll see you in five minutes 
oh  l√°  l√° 
i must thank you
for a most timely deliverance 
my pleasure  i heard your sos  do you
think it was put there deliberately 
of course it was 
but it will take more than a serpent
to interrupt the investigation
of hercule poirot 
how is the sleuthing going 
with eminence and discretion 
  no one to put the hand  grips on 
  not yet 
oh  er   
there is a dead cobra over there 
do me the kindness of having it removed 
please  thank you very much 
  come  race 
  a cobra  oh   cripes 
never have i seen such a reptile
in a first class cabin  never 
who s next  pennington 
we know he s a  wrong  un 
oh  he s a dangerous one 
monsieur poirot  i presume 
excusez  nous  madame 
perhaps you will permit us to join you 
of course 
well 
your cabin is next to madame doyle s 
 n est ce pas 
it is 
did you hear anything strange
late last night 
i certainly did 
i am a very light sleeper 
i was awakened by a popping sound 
a popping sound 
exactly  just like a champagne cork
coming out of a bottle 
an indifferent champagne 
you understand 
not a great vintage 
that makes a much more discreet sound 
could it have been a small pistol
instead of an old champagne cork 
very possibly 
though i m sure you must appreciate
that i have a minimal familiarity
with firearms 
we have found it  we have found it 
oh  goody  goody 
oh  goody  goody  gumdrops 
this certainly takes the camel s  hump 
oh  yes  and no mistake  gentlemen 
gentlemen  i m sure we have
found what you re looking for 
  thank you  mr  choudry 
  no mention 
ah  without question 
the pistol of mademoiselle jackie 
new derringer  22  four shot 
two bullets fired 
a man s handkerchief  looks like blood 
and a marble ashtray
to send it to the bottom 
  and my stole 
  this is yours  madam 
well  of course it s mine 
i missed it last night in the saloon 
look  the murderer must ve wrapped it around
the pistol  to deaden the noise of the shots 
impertinence  that stole was
given to me in romania
by crown prince carol himself 
people are no respecters
of other people s property 
nor indeed of other people s jewellery 
what can you be referring to  monsieur 
i m referring to the potsdam pearls 
madame 
which belong to madame doyle
and which have been abducted 
  abducted 
   d√©rob√©  purloined 
pinched 
and why are you looking at me
in that too familiar  continental way 
what have these pearls to do with me 
ah  i am the nasty
little   h eavesdropper  madame 
i heard that you much admire
these pearls 
that you would give  every tooth
in your head to possess them  
that bloody bowers 
it is my theory that you have
an obsessive love of jewellery  madame 
that you coveted madame
doyle s pearls
and that you determined to possess them 
even if this meant robbery or murder 
you do not deny it  madame 
i can picture you walking the deck
last night 
waiting for madame doyle to be asleep 
go to bed 
quite by chance 
you see the shooting in the saloon 
  look  jackie 
  i ll kill you first 
jackie 
when the room is empty  you seize
the opportunity of taking the gun 
you go to madame doyle s cabin 
knowing that her husband will not be there 
you shoot her and then you take
the pearls from her bedside table 
you will withdraw that 
or i shall prosecute you for slander
with the utmost vigour 
it will not equal the vigour
with which i shall search this boat 
and in particular  your cabin 
madame  for those pearls 
i give you a good afternoon 
  you perfectly foul french upstart 
  belgian upstart  please  madame 
was it necessary to be
so rough on the old lady 
i mean really  you seem to be
accusing everybody 
with reason  mon colonel  what  you
think old ladies don t commit murder 
i am convinced she has the pearls 
the only question is 
did she kill to acquire them 
  monsieur choudry 
  marhaban   hello 
  yes  colonel 
  we will depart immediately 
i ve already given the orders 
at this very moment 
the engineer is building up steam 
why the sudden rush 
i tell you  mon  vieu  old man   i feel
the presence of evil all about me 
the sooner we reach wadi halfa 
the better 
i ll lock these up in a safe place 
then we must commence our search
for the pearls 
that s the last of the crew s cabins 
maybe she threw them overboard 
you forget that we have not yet
examined pennington s cabin 
that s right  let s do it now 
 ahoy there 
so our journey is continuing 
good afternoon  madame 
will you not join me
for a little refreshment 
this marvellous little man here
has just made me
the most extraordinary concoction
out of native fruit juices 
it s called a golden sobek 
and is named after the god of
the ancient city of crocodilopolis 
not for me  thank you very much 
sometimes i do take the  hair of the dog 
but never the scale of the crocodile 
race 
and how are you getting along
with your investigation
of this tragic affair 
monsieur porridge 
ah  normalment  madame 
normally  as they say 
oh  the  crime passionnel 
the primitive instinct to kill 
so closely allied to the sex instinct 
i have every sympathy
for that poor  half crazed jackie 
her emotions are a turmoil 
her hot latin blood raging
to be avenged on the woman
who stole her man 
yes  of course  but it could
have been someone else 
with a motive at least as good 
  oh  who 
  you  madame otterbourne 
  what are you talking about 
  oh  come  come 
both your daughter and you know
that you cannot libel the dead 
now you will never have to pay
those huge damages she was asking for 
  yes  but one would hardly kill for that 
  would one not 
  well 
  i ll have another golden what have you 
you know  mrs  otterbourne   
it is you that i can see looking
into the saloon through the windows
at that  as you put it 
poor  half crazed jacqueline
shooting monsieur doyle 
and then  when everyone has gone 
running in to take up the gun 
and then stealing forth
to kill madame doyle 
no  my world is the world of grand love
and passionate romance 
not grubby murders 
now  if you ll please leave me alone 
well  if we have disturbed you 
we are both  desolate 
life can be so cruel 
you must be brave  very brave 
to bear the calumnies of life 
here  barman 
this crocodile has lost its  croc  
what a perfectly dreadful woman 
why doesn t somebody shoot her  i wonder 
well perhaps one day  the subscribers
of the lending libraries
will club together and hire an assassin 
so  madame van schuyler
is foolish enough
to play games with hercule poirot 
you realise  of course  you have
no actual proof that she stole them 
the fact that the pearls have been
returned does not mean for a moment
that she did not kill
while stealing them in the first place 
pennington 
we must find that document he was
trying to induce madame doyle to sign 
what s this 
  poirot 
  yeah 
ho  well  that proves that mademoiselle
jackie was not the only passenger
  who was travelling armed 
  still  linnet doyle was not shot
  with a thing this size 
  no  obviously not 
oh l√† l√†  l√† l√† l√† l√† 
quelle  pagaille   what a mess  
oh  oh  oh 
your eyes are better  tell me 
what the hell is going on 
we re going through your private
papers  sir  isn t that obvious 
you re what 
it may be the custom in paris
to go through people s things 
but we re not in paris now 
  brussels  sir  the country is   
  i don t care if it s borneo 
you have no right to be in my cabin 
no right at all 
we have every right 
pending the arrival of the police 
the company has commissioned us
to investigate this murder 
which has nothing to do with my papers 
on the contrary 
they prove that
in spite of madame doyle s marriage 
you are still trying
to control her money 
so what  there s no law against it 
there is a law against
swindling your client 
and my people don t like
to see it contravened 
your people  who the hell are they 
i represent mrs  doyle s english lawyers 
and quite frankly  we re not at all happy
about the way you and your partner
have been handling her affairs 
  go to hell 
  now look here   
  her affairs are in perfect order 
  oh  i wish that were true 
you see  i think you came over here
in order to get her signature
on this power of attorney 
you failed and so you went
to the temple of amun   
  and you climbed
to the top of the tall pillar 
there  you dislodged a stone which fell
and which narrowly avoided killing her 
you can t pin that on me  now  get out of
here  i ve heard enough of this garbage 
you may have to  one day 
listen to a little more of such garbage
from the lips of a public prosecutor 
oh  this is yours  i believe 
belgium 
let us change for dinner 
j ai  faim   i m hungry 
  poirot  you have a woman 
   femme is woman 
j ai  faim  i am peckish 
oh  i must have a word
with that little one 
i will join you at the table 
mon colonel 
be good enough to order me
les  morilles   morel mushroom 
les morilles  oh  moray  eel 
well  how goes it with you 
ma  petite 
badly  monsieur poirot 
i feel so ashamed 
  his wife s dead  and   
  now he s available to you again 
is it so wrong of me to hope
he ll come back 
i still love him 
and now he needs me more than ever 
oh  monsieur poirot  could i    
could you arrange for me to see him 
just for five minutes  please 
i don t see why not 
that is  if he wishes 
and the herr doctor raises no objection 
i will make some inquiries 
ah   gut  the temperature is down 
alright  herr poirot  i ve no objection 
provided the visit is short 
   f√ºnf minuten at the most  ja 
  merci  docteur 
mademoiselle jackie 
  you can see him now 
  oh  thank you 
  hello  jackie 
  simon 
i m very sorry about linnet 
  thank you 
  simon  i didn t kill her 
  i swear that 
  you don t have to say it 
i know 
  forgive me  please 
  jackie   
last night i was mad 
i might have killed you 
what  with a rotten little peashooter
like that 
will they be able   
will you walk again 
don t be a chump 
as soon as we get to wadi halfa
they ll dig the damn thing out
and i ll be as right as rain 
ah  ja  yeah 
remember  f√ºnf minuten  ja 
oh  simon  i m so dreadfully sorry 
there now 
there s nothing to apologise for 
 qu est ce que c est que √ßa 
 what s this  
i asked for a plate of morilles 
  what s that  when it s at home 
  mushrooms 
oh  i m sorry 
i thought you wanted a moray eel 
that s the best they could do 
  i ve ordered you a new bottle of wine 
  why 
because the remains of last night s bottle
was a little mouldy when he poured it out 
mouldy 
yes  you know 
it had a lot of bits in it 
but that s the normal sediment
for a great bottle of ch√¢teau p√©trus 
  will you join me in some 
  no  thanks 
you stick to your wine 
i ll stick to my whisky 
you drink whisky all the    wine   
oh  how strange    of course 
may i 
you know  poirot  the way i see it 
everybody could have done it 
and everybody had a reason for doing it 
it s incredible 
absolument 
  good evening 
  good evening 
good evening  madam  please 
come quick  quick 
  fetch dr  bessner 
  yes  sir 
you see what this is 
money  looks like a piece of a thousand
franc note  it has to be blackmail 
she must have known something
about linnet doyle s murderer 
what idiots we have been 
ah   nom de rien 
 goshdarnit 
what did she say this afternoon 
 if i had been unable to sleep 
if i had stayed on deck 
i could then  perhaps 
have seen the assassin enter
or leave madame doyle s cabin  
but that is precisely what happened 
she did see the assassin 
and it s because of her greed
that she now lies dead 
much good that does us  we still
don t know who killed either woman 
no  no  no  that s not quite right 
you see  we have been running
in the wrong direction  you and i 
we know almost all there is to know   
   except that what we know seems   
   seems incredible 
impossible 
ah  killings 
killings  all the time  killings 
ja 
dead no more than an hour 
the throat s been cut   
   with a very thin knife 
one like this 
that s very interesting  doctor 
are you quite sure that
none of yours are missing 
 was   what  
so now you think that i 
ludwig bessner 
have killed this miserable
little  femme de chambre   maid 
oh   gott im himmel 
 god in heaven  
what do i have to do with the squalid
affairs of the lower classes 
it is well known they do not have
neuroses  just animal passions 
  take the body to the ice room 
  yes  sir 
so you think you know  huh 
i must confess 
i don t see any real light myself 
dr  bessner has just told me
what happened to the maid 
i must speak with you
and mr  doyle at once 
i wouldn t go in there  if i were you 
dr  bessner is rather cross 
my good man  i know that  but a little
 kraut crossness won t stop me now 
you see  i know 
mr  doyle  i know who
killed louise bourget 
what  you say you know
who killed louise 
ah  ja  not to shout 
and you  frau otterbourne 
you cannot be here  i forbid it 
my patient is resting 
but i must  you see 
it s vitally important 
you see  i know all  all  i tell you 
now  look  i will not take
that pushing mit  ellbogen  elbows 
mr  doyle  i tell you that i 
salome otterbourne 
have succeeded
where frail men have faltered 
i am a finer sleuth
than even the great hercule porridge 
mrs  otterbourne 
for god s sake  calm down 
now tell us the whole story 
from the beginning 
  i refuse to speak in front of him 
  now look  you will not speak at all  eh 
new   raus  raus  out   his temperature is
rising with all this disturbance 
doctor  it will rise even more
if we don t hear what she has to say 
herr doyle   
we are talking about
the murderer of my wife 
oh  ja  ja  alright 
you can stay drei minuten 
three minutes 
and you  now  you speak softly  eh 
odious little man 
madam  do i understand that you have
evidence to show who killed mrs  doyle 
you do and i have 
you will agree  will you not 
that whoever killed louise bourget
also killed linnet doyle 
  that is quite possible 
  well   
i saw who killed louise bourget
with my own eyes 
pray continue  madame 
i happened to be in the stern
of the boat talking to one of the crew 
who was showing me
a most intriguing sight 
a buffalo and a camel  yoked together 
tilling the soil 
you saw this by moonlight 
of course  madame 
yes  i did 
i have amazingly good eyesight 
anyway  i left him 
and suddenly  as i rounded the corner 
i heard a scream 
it came from louise bourget s cabin 
then i saw the cabin door open 
as the door opened wider 
i saw that it was   
pennington s 
i heard a big boom 
what   now  has happened 
mrs  otterbourne s been shot 
  mr  pennington 
  yes 
this is your gun  i believe 
anybody could have taken that gun from my cabin 
everybody knew it was there 
i was saying just the other night 
i always carry a gun with me on my travels abroad 
it is time for these murders to stop 
already  i have  unfortunately 
delayed too long 
i would like to see everybody 
please  in the saloon 
when all will be revealed 
in  er    30 minutes 
i can t believe it  mother dead 
why 
  she must have found something out 
  oh  god  poor darling 
i loved her  in spite of it all 
and now she s gone 
i can t take it in 
suddenly i m   
all alone 
no  you re not 
i ll look after you 
oh  jim   
poor mother 
you d never have got away from her 
not while she was alive 
madame  mesdemoiselles  messieurs 
the game is over 
i  hercule poirot  now know 
beyond a shadow of a doubt 
who killed madame doyle  louise bourget
and madame otterbourne 
foolishly  i began this investigation
with the preconceived idea
that there must have been a witness
to the shooting scene between
mademoiselle jackie and simon doyle 
that this person must have taken
the gun from here 
after everyone had left the saloon 
and must have used it
to kill madame doyle
and to attempt to frame
mademoiselle jackie 
you see  mes  amis 
 my friends 
it is not as though there were
any lack of suspects among you 
she might have been killed by someone
trying to shut her defamatory mouth 
or by someone whose father had been
ruined by madame doyle s father 
or by someone obsessed
with the idea of robbery 
or by someone who bitterly resented
anyone inheriting that amount of money 
or by someone who was desperately
trying to save her mother
from financial ruin 
or yet 
by someone anxious to escape
exposure as a fraudulent trustee 
or by someone who simply mistook
the identity of the victim 
and then i remembered
something very important 
on the night of the killing 
i slept heavily 
not lightly  as is my custom 
why 
because my wine had been drugged
by someone who did not wish me to be
present at the night s events 
this was the easiest thing in the world 
the bottles stand open on the
dining room table all day long 
you  mon colonel 
you even sent the bottle back 
saying  to use your words 
that it was  mouldy  
and this in itself plainly implies
premeditation on someone s part 
it means that yesterday before 7 30 
when dinner was served 
the crime had already been decided upon 
i began to think back on something that has
been puzzling me from the beginning 
if the intention was to implicate
mademoiselle jackie 
why had the gun been removed
from madame doyle s cabin 
and then i understood 
the murderer had removed the gun
because he  or she  had to remove it 
there was no other course 
and there was more 
dr  bessner 
you examined madame doyle s body 
ja 
you will remember that there were
signs of scorching round the wound 
in other words 
the gun had been placed very close
to her head before being fired 
that is correct 
but when we recovered
the gun from the nile 
it was wrapped in this
brocade stole
and had evidently been fired
through its folds 
presumably in order to deaden
the sound of the shot 
dr  bessner  if it had been fired
through the stole 
there would have been no scorching
on madame doyle s temple 
in other words  the shot that killed
madame doyle could not have been fired
through the stole 
and then  perhaps 
it was the other one 
the one which jacqueline
de bellefort fired at simon doyle 
jackie 
but no  we have a witness for that 
we know it s not so 
therefore  there was a third shot 
one of which we know nothing 
but    there were only two shots
missing from the gun 
the next curious circumstance occurred
in madame doyle s cabin 
in it i found two bottles
of coloured nail polish 
one bottle was labelled  rose   but
the few drops remaining in that bottle
were not pale pink 
but bright red 
and instead of the usual smell
of pear drops  vinegar 
mes amis  it was red ink 
which formed an inevitable link
with this handkerchief
which we found
together with the gun
wrapped up in the stole 
and ink washes easily out of linen 
leaving a pale pink stain 
then something happened which put
the matter beyond all doubt 
louise bourget was killed because
she was blackmailing the murderer 
we know this not only because of
the fragment of a thousand franc note
which we found clutched
between her dead fingers 
but also because of some
rather curious words she used
only this morning 
naturally 
if i d been unable to sleep   
naturally  if i had
been unable to sleep 
if i had stayed on deck 
i might then perhaps have seen the
assassin enter or leave madame s cabin 
now  what exactly did that tell us 
what exactly did she tell
us with that 
that she had stayed on deck 
she did see the murderer 
yes  but you still fail to see
my point  mon colonel  excuse me 
  why did she say that to us 
  as a hint 
as a hint  of course 
but why hint to us 
she knows who the murderer is 
alright  she can do one of two things 
she can tell us
or else she can keep quiet
and demand money
from the person concerned later 
but she does
neither of these two things 
she uses the conditional tense 
if you please   if i had been  
this can mean only one thing 
she s hinting  alright  yes 
but she s hinting to the murderer 
in other words 
he was present at the time 
but apart from you and me 
only one other person was present 
precisely  simon doyle 
what 
yes  you are under the constant
supervision of dr  bessner 
she had to speak then 
she might not have got another chance 
  don t be so bloody ridiculous 
  bloody rid    oh  i don t think i m being ridiculous
i remember very clearly your answer 
 i will look after you  
 no one is accusing you of anything  
this is exactly the assurance
that she wanted  and which she got 
oh  mr  p   you really have made a fool
of yourself this time  and no mistake 
i mean  i ve got plenty of witnesses to prove
that i couldn t possibly have killed linnet 
i know you have 
but you did kill her
and louise bourget saw you 
oh  what nonsense 
i tell you that herr doyle
could not have moved about the boat
with a fractured leg 
i tell you that i  ludwig bessner 
would testify to this
to any court in the world 
in that case  i would have to say
that your testimony is irrelevant 
  irrelevant 
  unanwendbar 
unanwendbar  me 
i have testified
in some of the most complex
psychological cases of the century 
my testimony alone saved
strutzrumple 
the dresden  sachertorte murderer 
from execution 
  and in the case   
  calmez vous  calmez vous 
your testimony is irrelevant because
you started to tend to monsieur doyle
five minutes after he had been shot 
but i tell you he could not have
moved during those five minutes 
i agree  if he d been shot at
that time  but had he been 
consider what had actually
been seen 
mademoiselle rosalie saw
jacqueline fire her pistol 
she saw doyle collapse to the Ô¨Çoor 
and then turning away to seek help 
she ran into monsieur ferguson 
who had heard the shot 
all he saw was doyle clutching
a red stained handkerchief to his leg 
he quite naturally assumed
that doyle had been shot 
but the assumption was wrong 
the bullet had not gone into doyle 
but elsewhere 
and now what happens 
doyle insists that jackie be taken away
to her cabin and not be left alone 
and so jackie is helped
to her cabin
by mademoiselle rosalie
and monsieur ferguson 
then  mademoiselle rosalie
goes to fetch miss bowers 
accordingly 
all the activity is centred
on the starboard side
of the boat 
miss bowers 
two minutes are all
that doyle needs 
he takes of  his shoes 
picks up the gun from under the sofa 
where jackie had
thoughtfully thrown it
so that it would be forgotten
until later 
and runs like a hare
along the port deck 
he then enters his wife s cabin 
doyle then takes madame van schuyler s
stole which he had previously hidden 
and wrapping up the gun in it
in order both to muffle sound
and to prevent scorching 
fires a bullet into his own leg 
he removes one of the spent cartridges 
which he disposes of 
and inserts a fresh one  thus
indicating  should the gun be found 
that only two bullets
had been fired from it 
he then rewraps the gun in the stole 
adds the stained handkerchief
and a marble ashtray to make sure
that it all sinks to the bottom 
and throws the whole bundle
out of the window into the nile 
and now he lies back
on the sofa 
clasping a fresh handkerchief
to his leg 
this time in genuine agony 
c est extraordinaire 
n est ce pas 
it s impossible 
i can scarcely believe it 
of course it is 
absolutely bloody impossible 
why do you say it s impossible 
you yourself told me
that you heard softly running feet 
what reason was there for
anyone to run 
yes  i know  but to do all that
on the spur of the moment 
once and for all  mon colonel 
it was not on the spur of the moment 
it was carefully planned 
  by doyle 
  oh  doyle  he merely acted the part 
it was planned by his accomplice 
mademoiselle jacqueline de bellefort 
you must be mad 
no  i m not mad 
that s the truth 
who gave doyle his alibi 
you did  by firing that shot 
and who gave you your alibi 
doyle  by insistingb that
someone stay with you all night 
it s not true  it s not 
it is true  why bother to deny it 
you and doyle were lovers 
you still are lovers 
the plan was that simon would kill
his wife  inherit the money 
and then aftewvards  at some later date 
marry his old love 
it was a very brilliant concept 
your persecution of madame doyle 
simon s feigned rage 
your selection of mademoiselle rosalie
as a witness 
and all that build up to the shooting 
the exaggerated hysteria   
there was only one risk
you really took 
and that was that simon s wound
simply had to be disabling 
oh  and  er  pardon me 
but one piece of foolishness 
which was the drawing of the letter  j 
on the wall of the cabin 
so melodramatic it could only have
one effect 
that of exonerating you 
and who would want to do that
except an accomplice 
but then    the plan began
to go wrong  did it not 
louise bourget has
been wakeful 
she sees doyle
run into his wife s cabin 
she hears the shot and sees
him return to the saloon 
she makes her greedy bid
for hush money
and in doing so 
signs her own death wanant 
herr doyle could not have killed her 
because he could not have moved 
  i will swear to that 
  you would be right 
she was killed by mademoiselle jackie 
no 
yes  i am afraid there is no doubt 
just before dinner 
she asked to see monsieur doyle 
quite foolishly  as it turns out 
i agreed and brought them together 
the one apparently guilt ridden
and distraught  the other comforting 
oh  simon  i m so dreadfully sorry 
there  now 
however  i m sure as soon as
we ve gone  the tone changes 
it s going fine  darling 
we re nearly there 
like hell it is  louise knows 
she saw me 
she s trying to blackmail us 
i ll have to shut her up 
  can t we pay her 
  all our lives 
jackie  are you sure 
  give me some money 
  why 
that s what she s waiting for 
it ll put her off guard  where is it 
in my jacket  in the wardrobe 
  i love you 
  i know 
are we insane 
oh  i don t know 
but we can t stop now 
jackie   
wish me luck 
unfortunately for her 
in her haste 
she leaves a tiny fragment
of a thousand franc note behind
clutched in the dead
woman s fingers 
but even more unfortunately 
she is seen by madame otterbourne
leaving the cabin 
she is unaware of this at the time 
and returns to dr  bessner s cabin
to replace the scalpel 
then  having changed for dinner 
somewhat Ô¨Çushed and out of breath 
she hurries into the dining room 
as for madame otterbourne 
when she hears of the murder
of louise bourget from dr  bessner 
she suddenly realises that she has
actually seen the murderer
leaving the scene of the crime 
what  you say you know
who killed louise 
calm  not to shout 
and you  frau 
you cannot be here  i forbid it 
it seemed strange to me
at the time
that doyle should be shouting
so loudly at madame otterbourne 
now  of course 
i realise that what he was doing
was shouting a warning to jackie
next door 
mrs  otterbourne  for god s sake 
calm down 
now tell us the whole story 
from the beginning 
and why did he ask her to start at
the beginning and tell the whole story 
obviously  to give jackie time to act 
which she did  like lightning 
herr doyle   
we are talking about
the murderer of my wife 
mr  pennington 
she boasted once that her father
had taught her to be a crack shot
and her boast was not an idle one 
i saw it   
she dropped the gun and
bolted into her own cabin next door 
it was highly risky 
but it was her only possible chance 
voila  mes amis  that is all 
congratulations  mr  p  
on a highly amusing theory 
oh  it s more than a theory 
unfortunately  it is the truth 
then what happened to the first bullet 
the one that jackie fired at me 
oh  that s a good question  yes 
can you all see this table 
there s a newly made bullet hole 
just there 
of course  you had time to dispose of
the bullet and throw it into the nile 
  what pifÔ¨Çe 
  oh  no  it s not pifÔ¨Çe 
remember  we have proof
that all three bullets came
from mademoiselle jacqueline s gun 
suppose that s true  monsieur poirot 
where s the proof
that simon fired the other two 
well  that s right  you ve no proof 
you ve absolutely no proof at all 
we ll produce some  never fear 
you won t get away with this 
no  well  you ll never convince
a jury without proof 
and where do you intend to get it  mr  p  
from linnet 
oh  no  not from linnet 
from you 
  from me  what do you mean 
  it s a bluff  simon 
it s very far from being a bluff 
there is a very simple test
which is now accepted as conclusive
evidence in any court in the world 
it s called a moulage test 
   moulage test  
  yes  moulage 
you know  when you fire a gun
tiny grains of powder become embedded
in the skin
and they can now be removed
by a thin layer of wax 
that s a moulage test 
oh  mon colonel 
will you administer this 
when you wish 
i assume  of course  that you re
willing to submit to such a test 
there is no pain involved 
just a little    warmth 
jackie  what   
what can we do 
nothing  it s over 
i don t mind so much  monsieur 
about me  i mean 
you do mind  don t you  a bit 
  yes 
  and don t judge simon too harshly 
he never had any money
and linnet simply dazzled him
with all that wealth 
simon  do you remember what you said 
i said if this was a book 
i d marry linnet and she d die
within a year and leave me everything 
that s when i saw the idea
come into his head 
i was terrified  i knew
he d try some perfectly absurd way 
he even had the idea
of putting a cobra in her bed 
well  you found another use
for that serpent  mademoiselle 
i m glad it didn t kill you  monsieur 
  ooof   
  truly 
so you   
you see   
   i had to help him 
i ve always had to help him 
oh  jackie  i love you 
i love you 
stop 
monsieur poirot 
quelle trag√©die 
a splendid piece of detection 
poirot  i must say 
you know  i couldn t possibly have
carried out that moulage test 
i have no wax 
you astonish me  mon colonel 
you absolutely astonish me 
goodbye  monsieur poirot 
i m afraid the description
of your cases
will have to wait until another time 
oh  quel  dommage  madame 
 a pity 
i was hoping to recount to you
my recent extraordinary experience
on the orient express 
come on  bowers  time to go 
this place is beginning
to resemble a mortuary 
thank god  you ll be in one yourself
before too long 
  bloody old fossil 
  temper  temper  bowers 
what you need is a nice cool holiday 
i was thinking of a trip
through the gobi desert 
monsieur poirot  
i wanted you to be the first to know 
we ve just got engaged 
oh  mes f√©licitations  mademoiselle 
  monsieur 
  congratulations 
  and bonne chance to both of you 
  thank you 
  goodbye  monsieur poirot 
  goodbye  sir 
  colonel race 
  good luck 
oh  mes  petits  a word of advice 
 kids 
as they say in america   take it easy  
we ll try 
  what are you thinking 
  i was thinking of moli√©re 
 la grande ambition des femmes
est d inspiner l amour
