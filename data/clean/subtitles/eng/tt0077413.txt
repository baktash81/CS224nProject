decapitated clergyman

you were a trifle lucky
to find that cake knife
up the chimney like that
lucky with me its the exercise
of the little grey cells
luck i leave to the others
yes id forgotten
your opinions about yourself
might one ask
what are you doing here
im on les vacances
vacation
shortly im going up the nile
on the steamer and you
oh the same oddly enough
oh in other words youre
following one of the passengers

oh
like yourself

this chair is free eh
in this world comrade
nothings free
bitte
forget it sit down
danke you are reading das kapital

dr ludwig bessner
of the bessner institute zurich
jim ferguson citizen of the world
you are on holiday perhaps eh

im observing the decline
of the capitalist system my friend
oh indeed
well youve got
a good specimen there eh
the young kaugummi heiress
chewing gum
that parasite
you dont approve
she makes me sick
in any decent society
ah you may be right
she has altogether too much power
monsieur
shukran jazeelan thanks v much
cin cin it
linnet linnet honey
uncle andrew
what a surprise i didnt know
you were travelling in egypt
well its very sudden as a matter
of fact im on my honeymoon
your honeymoon what do you know
is this the lucky young man
darling this is my american lawyer
and trustee andrew pennington
simon simon doyle
pleased to meet you sir
how do you do
wont you join us
well just for a moment
but dont worry
im not going to intrude
i know how young people are
the cynosure of all eyes
focal point
even you with your english reserve
gaze
shes very beautiful
oh shes very rich
you know who she is of course
of course  yes
do forgive me for butting in
but i have a bet with my daughter here
that youre hercules porridge
the famous french sleuth
not quite i am hercule poirot
the famous belgian sleuth
i told you rosalie
theres only one monsieur poirot
in the world hes unmistakable
as indeed i realise i am myself
my mother is salome otterbourne
the novelist
otter salo of course
natrellement enchanté
so here we are
two famous people in one plaoe
oh three surely
i was talking about genius
not mere money monsieur
oh you know colonel race
my old friend
this is and her daughter
charmed simply charmed
please sit down madame mademoiselle
voila
youre probably working on
some other book now madame
set in egypt perhaps
how thrillingly clever of you
to deduce that monsieur porridge
i am here to absorb local colour
for my grand opus
snow on the sphinx face
frozen enigma turns
to incandescent love
as this young english girl from
haslemere scarcely out of school
melts the barbarous heart
of a cruel desert sheikh
somehow i dont think
monsieur poirot
is a very keen reader
of romantic novels mother
of course he is all frenchmen are
theyre not afraid of good strong sex
unlike i might say most of
our leading lending libraries
they have banned
salome otterbourne
for speaking the truth
about men and women
but she goes on nonetheless
the truth yes the truth
its so difficult to tell
thank you monsieur
well perhaps you would
join me in a tango er mademoiselle
a little exercise after dinner
do you tango colonel
poorly im afraid mrs otterbourne
then i shall teach you
to do it correctly
as it was done in old spain
when it was known as the cheeker
that is to say
with a sensuous erotic dash
damn it jackie
cant you leave us alone
waiter
monsieur poirot
monsieur poirot
i saw you with linnet
this morning
how much is she paying you
to warn me off
no no i accepted no commission
from madame doyle nor will i
what i have to say to you
is in pure friendship
oh yes and what would
you like to say
that im making a public show of myself
that im crazy
i say bury the dead
not as the egyptians do
preserving the body in order to ensure
the immortality of the soul
no properly finally
turn your back on the past
look only fonlvard
remember time heals everything
if you think im suffering
youre quite wrong
actually im rather
enjoying myself
yes your pleasure is the very worst
part of it mademoiselle
i dont care
simon was mine and he loved me
then she came along and
its only a tiny thing
but its lethal
and my father taught me
to be a crack shot
sometimes i swear ill put this gun
right against her head
and then ever so gently
pull the trigger
when i hear that sound
more and more
i know how you feel
we all feel like that at times
only i warn you mademoiselle
do not allow evil into your heart
it will make a home there
if love cant live there
evil will do just as well
oh how how sad mademoiselle
hello mr p
youre going back to the hotel
where else
look its a surprise for linnet
do you think shell like it
that depends does she smoke
just craven a
by the way have you had a chance
to talk to jackie yet
yes just a few moments ago
well good i hope you got
her to see some sense
alas to her
sense is perpetual revenge
are you serious
im always serious mon ami
jackies stubborn i know
and damn possessive
but surely
did she want to possess you
well i suppose so yes she did
but she has a hell of a temper
and a mind of her own
she wishes to wear the trousers
yes and a man cant have that
can he mr p
no no ne peut pas
you know when i first met linnet
well how should i put it
it was like the moon after sunrise you
just dont notice its there any more
after i met her
jackie just didnt exist
yes some women have that power
but how are you going to find
a way out of your present dilemma
well i have the most marvellous plan
and its absolutely foolproof
cabby
the railway station quickly
were late for the alexandria train
the railway station
fast as you can
haare ka
foghorn
thank you
look there she is
welcome welcome welcome
welcome aboard the kamak yes

er and er staterooms
i guess from your faces
which is which ok
er you are mrs and
miss otterbourne
righty
wrongy
im mrs van schuyler
and i wish to be taken
to my cabin immediately
bowers will have the cabin opposite
on the starboard side
the roasting afternoon sun
may do wonders
for those jaundiced jowls of hers
right away madam right away
yes you must be dr bessner
such elegant german moustaches
im afraid youd never make
a detective monsieur
the moustaches although
undeniably elegant are belgian
my name is poirot hercule poirot
ah the famous monsieur poirot
i grovel in mortification
i grovel
look wouldnt it just be simpler
for us to give you our names
and you to give us
the cabins that we booked
simpler ah lummy yes
unquestionably simpler unquestionably
such a brilliant lack
of complication
in a trice the safragi will
conduct you all to your stateroom
safragi saf servant
ah we start
may i suggest that you all take
your last look at the city
safra safragi
well weve done it
we got rid of her at last
what did you expect
youre a genius
well its not bad
for the simple simon
fabulous isnt it
youre the ridgeway girl
arent you
and youre mrs van schuyler
i wondered if wed ever break the ice
well i seldom talk to strangers
but never to strange honeymooners
im glad youre breaking your rule
well rules are made to be broken
at least mine are by me
oh theyre beautiful
thank you
and amazing
if you know how theyre made
a tiny piece of grit makes
its way into an oyster
which eventually becomes
a pearl of great price
hanging round the neck
of a pretty girl like you
i never thought of it that way
well you should
the oyster nearly dies
come along now back to the cabin
time for your massage
my companion bowers
she did 15 rounds once
with jack dempsey
he was never the same man again
sorry miss ridgeway
mrs doyle mrs simon doyle
you have got to forgive miss bowers
shes just unfamiliar
with the married state
i saw you drooling over her pearls
shut up bowers
youd give every tooth in your head
to lay your hands on them
what nonsense
just because youve got a grudge against her
or rather her father no need to be uncivil
grudge
melhuish ridgeway ruined my family
well you should be grateful
if he hadnt youd have missed
the pleasure of working for me
i could kill her on that score alone
tea madame
i am salome otterbourne
and i must have a word
i thought we were already having words
through our lawyers
it is about that
that i have come to supplicate
supplicate
i mean to entreat or to appeal
if you like
im afraid we authors are
a little ﬂowery in our speech
and defamatory in our writing
im sorry you should have taken
passion under the persimmon tree that way
i assure you the intention was
merely to show a young girls heart
beginning to beat
to the primordial drum
cant you see my dear that what
i wrote was really quite ﬂattering
frankly mrs otterbourne
i dont consider being likened
to a nymphomaniacal baboon ﬂattering
and i suggest we leave it to our lawyers
to decide what is adequate compensation
for being the butt
of your vulgar drivel
good afternoon
philistine
ill show you what reputation
is about
im sorry to intrude
uncle andrew
but these are the papers
i told you needed signing
the lease on the chrysler building
ah lets see the silver mine
concessions baku oil transfers
and the corn crispchoochew merger
just sign on the last page
right on the bottom my dear
but uncle andrew
i havent even read it yet
theres no need theres no need
its all quite straightforward
checked and double checked by me
but i always read everything
through before i sign
my father taught me that
he always said never to trust anyone
not even your own lawyers
dear old melhuish
what a sense of humour
well as far as im concerned ive
never read a legal document in my life
i certainly dont intend to start now
you dont say
isnt that a little feckless darling
yes absolutely
but im dying for a manhattan
arent you
alright
seeing were on our honeymoon
thats a girl
now the next one
i do hope im not er butting in
im a lawyer
i just wanted to say how much i admire
your businesslike attitude
your father was absolutely right never
sign a document until youve read it
im sure you agree sir
er sure sure theres no hurry
well now if youll excuse me
i hope ive not given offence
what if you have mr
race colonel race
what if you have colonel
lawyers are trained
to deal with offences
would you join us for a drink
in the bar
thank you most kind
and what about you mr p
after all
theres cause for celebration
as you see my plan to lose jackie
worked like a charm
yes so it would er
so it would seem
congratulations
mes félicitations
colonel race and
will join you in a er
moment
darling
madame i must talk with you
later louise
no now its important
ill see you in the bar
well
ive received a cable
my fiancé has sent his woman
back to her people
hes waiting for me
i must go to him
please give me the money
that you promised me
ive been with you for five years now
its completely out of the question
madame you promised me
hes still married louise
i implore you
i need that money as a dowry
ive worked hard for you
and youll continue to do so
until i say otherwise
madame you cant refuse me
thank you louise
chameau camel
mon dieu how she makes
enemies of them all my god
even her own lawyer
is trying to cheat her
you old fox so you noticed
well i knew that you werent here
how was it again
seulement pour les vacances
mon amimock accent
yes i suppose i can tell you
sub rosa i am working
for mrs doyles english lawyers
and they suspect andrew pennington
of well of
embezzling her money
thats about the size of it
you see under the terms
of the fathers will
she gets control of the money when
she marries and as she has recently married
he is trying to get her
to sign a document
which will get him out of the soup
exactly i think ive scared him off
for the moment
but who knows what hell try next
or any of them for that matter
inside the great temple of karnak
we pass the pedestals
of numerous small rams ja
each with a small image
of amenophis iii in front of it yeah
oh yes rams
lickerish priapic ruttish rams
how noble they are
with their proud ﬂanks ﬂared nostrils
and unashamed curled horns
ja ja
come fraulein come
you know karl marx said that
religion was the opium of the people
for your mother
its obviously sex
dont you think youd better
calm her down a little
shed do one of those beasts
a fearful injury
look mr ferguson my mother
may be a figure of fun for you
but she still happens to be my mother
she kept me marvellously in better days
im not going to desert her now that
now that what
nothing
im sorry
i didnt mean to be nosy
and i certainly didnt mean
to offend you
honestly miss otlerbourne
i am not as bad as i look
arent you
scouts honour
would you mind offending her
linnet ridgeways a leech
a parasite on the skin of society
for gods sake in a sane world
shed be bumped off
as a warning to the others
bumped off
thats what i said
mr ferguson
jim
jim is it true
you cant libel the dead
im not sure i understand the question
never mind
oh look isnt it wonderful
quite beyond comprehension
ah the artistic temperament
monsieur pennington
what strange forms it takes
im afraid that doesnt much
concern me monsieur poirot
i confine myself
to the world of facts and figures
the ancient egyptians felt
quite at home with facts and figures
the grand vizier ptahhotep
was crushed to death
under a thousand pieces of silver
because he embezzled
his masters treasury
you dont say
oh yes
god you alright
linnet you alright
come on easy
thats it come on up you come
alright
what happened
that stone must have fallen
or was pushed
to kill me
jackie
but shes not here
oh my poor madame
that was a close shave
it couldve been a nasty accident
accident
that stone has been up there
for 4000 years
it chooses the moment to fall when
there are people underneath it no
not exactly 4000 years herr poirot
these pillars were built in 1788
we all agree with you herr bessner
you may have a patient on your hands
please
oh most negligent of me
ja ja here
im alright really i am
ja ja but i think maybe you go back
to the boat you take a little rest eh
alright but only for a
couple of hours doctor
i must see the temple of abu simbel
this evening
oh that is most extraordinary
did you know that the easternmost figure
is the famous vocal statue
really
ja
then we must be there in time
thank you doctor
at sunset it emits a sad
plaintive note
he scares me
oh hes harmless
my god its fantastic
i think theyre frightening
no theyre not
do you think hell sing
a note for me
why not youre divine
welcome to the temple of abu simbel
the facade is 84 feet long
each of the statues of ramesses ii
is 65 feet high
get away from me get away
get away from me
ok darling
dont let her spoil everything
so you could not bury your dead
you cannot stay away
nope i cant keep away
you didnt really think id be fooled
by any trick simon could invent
im very sorry to see you here
mademoiselle
forgive me for saying so
but youre embarking on
a hazardous journey in troubled waters
you face who knows
what currents of misfortune
why do you say that
because its the truth
youre cutting the last bonds
which bind you to safety
you can still turn back
if you really want to
one must follow ones star
wherever it leads
even to disaster
even to hell itself
i left my bag in the bar
ill join you in a minute darling
well we are alone mein frau
the opportunity to talk to you in
private has not presented itself before
what do we have to talk about
my reputation frau doyle
you ran that institute in zurich
that is so
and you have been saying
so many unpleasant things about me
to people of influence
and position
i say youre a quack
frau doyle
whats more youre a dangerous quack
now listen to me
my good friend myra seligman
listened to you too well
and allowed you to give her
those filthy injections
i prescribed a course
of armadillo urine
ja i had used it previously
with great success
in the case of poor myra
she went barking mad thanks to you
i will not allow this
these irresponsible remarks
about my treatment have got to stop
then sue me if you dare
now you know that is impossible
any scandal attached to my clinic
would bring instant ruin
then its rather your funeral
isnt it
well lets hope that
it is not yours
do you want a crème de cacao
or a cognac perhaps
the service upstairs is so slow
nein danke
what time is it
theres a clock use your eyes
didnt your mother ever tell you
as far as servants are concerned
there is a vast difference
between amiable eccentricity
and downright rudeness
my mother was a lady
a disposition she failed
to pass on to you
its your bedtime
very well wheres my stole
i havent seen it
you sure you had it with you
of course im sure
well i havent seen it anywhere
use your eyes
monsieur poirot
i hope one day youll be able
to tell me about some of your cases
the the juicier ones
juicier ones
bloodier

keep my heyes hopen

perhaps youd be good enough
to escort me to my cabin
it is this way as you know
i suppose that uncouth young man will
appear now and attempt to seduce you
well dont let him succeed
without at least the show of a struggle
remember the chase is very important
oh mother
no this way is better
theres a beastly step here
which i always trip on
no no thats the river

ja
there is no time for writing
with the finger in blood
no no
oh you make a joke
well its a very small one
not in very good taste im afraid
the fact remains the j is on the wall
now its up to us to explain why
it seems a gesture
which is childishly melodramatic
doctor what about the time of death
well
she has been dead at least six hours
no longer than eight
that puts it between midnight
and 2 am
which is extraordinary
why is that
because it means quite simply
that mademoiselle jacqueline
could not have done it
you told me yourself
mon colonel
that madame doyle left the observation
saloon a little before 1145
to go to bed
and from then on jackie was in view
either of mademoiselle rosalie
and monsieur doyle
or of monsieur ferguson
and mademoiselle bowers
who injected her with morphia and
stayed with her in her cabin all night
and simon doyle is also eliminated
by reason of his broken leg
i dont suppose he couldve walked
very far with that wound
not one step i assure you
excellent lets hope the process
of elimination continues as smoothly
i am afraid it will not mon colonel
after all everyone on this boat knew
exactly why mademoiselle jacqueline
hated madame doyle
she was a natural for what
the americans would call a frameup
at least mein herr
you cannot suspect me
oh why not
you had a very good reason to kill her
as i discovered last night
oh then you did overhear
but that was no motive
i mean i could have sued her
and risk ruin murder is cheaper
and safer if you dont get caught
but i could not have done such a thing
i disagree
at the time of the shooting
of monsieur doyle
you could have been on deck
perhaps unable to sleep
you could have heard
the sound of voices
looked through the window
of the saloon seen what happened
go to bed
you cant treat me like this
now look jackie
ill kill you first
jackie
and remembered
the position of the gun
later when you were
called from your cabin
you could have picked up the gun
while you were tending monsieur doyle
later still when all was quiet
you could have left your cabin
unobserved by your sleeping patient
and gone to madame doyles cabin
and shot her
no herr doctor
i cannot rule you out
what you are suggesting is übermässig
outrageous ja
no i will not stay here
to be insulted
found something in the nail varnish
you cant catch flies with vinegar
on nattrape pas les mouches avec le vinaigre
i beg your pardon
its an old french proverb
which takes too long to explain
come my friend let us prepare
ourselves for our investigation
of the paying customers
how long was it in your estimation
between the time you and dr bessner
carried monsieur doyle from the saloon
to when you returned
to look for the gun
oh about three or four minutes
three or four minutes
by your own admission you were just outside
the saloon when the shooting took place
in other words it would have been
perfectly possible for you
to have noted the position of the gun
i agree perfectly possible
perfectly possible also for you to have
waited until the saloon was empty
then to have taken the gun
and only pretended not to have found it
then before returning
to dr bessner to report its loss
you could have used it
to kill madame doyle
i could have done
but as it happens i didnt
and you mademoiselle
you could have taken the gun
before you left here
when monsieur ferguson
was helping monsieur doyle
ill get miss bowers
yeah right
on your way to fetch miss bowers
you could have seized the opportunity
to take the gun to madame doyles cabin
and murder her
it would have added only a minute
or two to the time that you were away
miss bowers wake up miss bowers
whats that  could you please come
quickly theres been an accident
why should either of us
take the blasted gun
we have no reason
to murder linnet doyle
ah but she was a leech
she was a parasite
on the skin of society
who deserved to be bumped off
well yes but
oh yes monsieur bumped off
as a warning to the others
you damned froggy eavesdropper
belgian belgian heavesdropper
if you please sir
and you mademoiselle you were eager
to save your mother great damages
how could i possibly have done that
you asked a question two days ago
i will now answer it for you
you are quite right mademoiselle
you cannot libel the dead
i think youre horrid
you pretend to be
so kind and considerate
and all you want to do is trap us
i must find out what lies hidden
mademoiselle the truth
what it amounts to then is after
you gave miss jacqueline the morphia
she never stirred all night
exactly nervous reaction booze
and morphia
together theyd have sunk the titanic
so unquestionably
she could not have done the murder
no absolutely not
no but you could have
me
yes you mademoiselle
let us suppose you were out on deck
at the time of the shooting
and saw what took place and thus knew
where the gun was lying
young lady you come with me ja
youll be more help
than this stutzer here
whos scared at the sight
of a little blood
while monsieur ferguson
and mademoiselle rosalie
were assisting dr bessner
you could have left your unconscious patient
and run in here to pick up the gun
you would have had enough time
before monsieur ferguson returned
to search for it
then you could have hurried down
the port side to madame doyles cabin
and shot her
preposterous
why should i kill mrs doyle
because her father was
melhuish ridgeway
whose unscrupulous business methods
ruined your father
and condemned you to a servants life
poppycock from whom did you hear that
from your own lips mademoiselle
three days ago
how dare you listen
to a private conversation
some voices carry
is it true
yes it is
voila
but why should i kill mrs doyle
for something that happened years ago
because its effects are still
deeply resented by you to this day
no unfortunately mademoiselle
i cannot be persuaded
by your protestations
to my mind you had the means
the motive the opportunity
and what is more
the disposition to kill
have you quite finished
monsieur poirot
for the time being
but you will hold yourself ready
to answer further questions
should the need arise
i shall do no such thing
monsieur poirot
it is true about linnet
it is perfectly true
i didnt kill her i know
you all think i did but i didnt
calmez vous calmez vous ma petite
we know that you did not kill
madame doyle we have proved it
proved
thank god
what about simon is he alright
dr bessner seems reasonably satisfied
with his condition so far
i was mad last night
i might have killed him
do you think hell ever forgive me
its more than likely
its been my experience
that men are least attracted
to women who treat them well
miss bowers will you please escort miss jacqueline
to her cabin and see that shes alright
well arrange a visit
to monsieur doyle later on
oh thank you
i think you and i should visit him first
he must be awake by now
bonne idée good idea
the thing which intrig
intrigues me most about
this case is the pistol
the pistol
why is it missing
i fail to see why that is important
in many cases
the murder weapon is missing
even in a case
where a frameup is attempted no
why did the murderer go to the lengths
of writing j on the wall in blood
and then removing js gun
yes i see what you mean
oh they found something
one thing is for certain
madame doyle was not killed by a fish
are you alright
yes thank you
i must have just blacked out
for a moment
try a spot of lunch
it might give you some strength
no thank you i couldnt face it
you couldnt face it
do you permit that er
please do help yourself
i just cant believe that
that linnets dead
its a bad knock
i suppose it must look awfully black
against jackie
but i just know she wouldnt
commit coldblooded murder
no rest assured monsieur
we know for a fact it was
not mademoiselle jackie
thank god for that
well then do you have any idea
who it might have been
well it could have been
practically anybody
well only yesterday
she was saying
everybody around her on this boat
was her enemy
we have reason to believe
that she was right monsieur
monsieur
oh pardon
i came to see if you were comfortable
as comfortable as can be expected
thank you louise
ah the discoverer of the body
you should be able to shed
some light on all this
pardon
you you you accuse me
a respectable girl
i swear to you on my mothers grave
allons allons louise come come
dont fuss so just tell the truth
pas tant dhistoires faut dire la vérité
asseyezvous sit
you cant suspect me
monsieur le detective il faut pas se douter de moi
poor mrs doyle everyone loved her
cette pauvre madame doyle tout le monde laimait
so young so beautiful
elle était si jeune si belle
no one would want to kill her
il y a personne qui aurait voulu la tuer
louise dont joke ill
louise pas de blagues je vous
poirot can we please keep this in some
language which we can all understand
she said that all the world
loved madame doyle
at least thats a fresh approach
now then when did you last see
mrs doyle alive
last night monsieur i was in her cabin
to undress her and put her to bed
and then where did you go
to my cabin where else
and you didnt see or hear anything
after that that might help us
how could i monsieur my cabin
was on the other side of the boat
naturally if id been unable to sleep
if id stayed on deck then
perhaps i would have seen this assassin
enter and leave madames cabin
but as it is
oh monsieur i implore you
you see how it is
what else can i say
nobodys accusing you of anything
new dont worry louise
ill look after you
monsieur is very good
but
if you had not gone straight back to
your cabin after leaving madame doyle
you would have had time
to witness the shooting
of monsieur doyle in the saloon
ah non
ah oui
you could have walked on the deck
seen everything
then when the coast was clear
you could have taken the gun
returned
and shot madame doyle
monsieur you accuse me unjustly
why should i do such a wicked thing
just answer me that
oh louise
i know all about you
and your love affair
and madame doyles objections
to your leaving her
but i had no money and no references
i had no choice but to stay
précisément
and how you hated her for that
but i didnt kill her
one final question louise
where are madame doyles pearls
her pearls
she was wearing them last night
she put them on the table by her bed
and were they there this morning
mon dieu i didnt even look
i went to her bed i saw madame
i cried out and i ran out of the room
you did not even look
but i hercule poirot
have eyes which notice everything
the pearls were not on
the dressing table this morning
they had gone vanished
disparues
we must find the gun
and the pearls
yes that should not prove
too difficult
oh là là qil fait chaud
its hot youre right
yes i could do with a change of shirt
yes lets make a little pause
to freshen la toilette
and to rest the little grey cells
ill see you in five minutes
oh lá lá
i must thank you
for a most timely deliverance
my pleasure i heard your sos do you
think it was put there deliberately
of course it was
but it will take more than a serpent
to interrupt the investigation
of hercule poirot
how is the sleuthing going
with eminence and discretion
no one to put the hand grips on
not yet
oh er
there is a dead cobra over there
do me the kindness of having it removed
please thank you very much
come race
a cobra oh cripes
never have i seen such a reptile
in a first class cabin never
whos next pennington
we know hes a wrong un
oh hes a dangerous one
monsieur poirot i presume
excusez nous madame
perhaps you will permit us to join you
of course
well
your cabin is next to madame doyles
nestce pas
it is
did you hear anything strange
late last night
i certainly did
i am a very light sleeper
i was awakened by a popping sound
a popping sound
exactly just like a champagne cork
coming out of a bottle
an indifferent champagne
you understand
not a great vintage
that makes a much more discreet sound
could it have been a small pistol
instead of an old champagne cork
very possibly
though im sure you must appreciate
that i have a minimal familiarity
with firearms
we have found it we have found it
oh goody goody
oh goody goody gumdrops
this certainly takes the camels hump
oh yes and no mistake gentlemen
gentlemen im sure we have
found what youre looking for
thank you mr choudry
no mention
ah without question
the pistol of mademoiselle jackie
new derringer 22 four shot
two bullets fired
a mans handkerchief looks like blood
and a marble ashtray
to send it to the bottom
and my stole
this is yours madam
well of course its mine
i missed it last night in the saloon
look the murderer mustve wrapped it around
the pistol to deaden the noise of the shots
impertinence that stole was
given to me in romania
by crown prince carol himself
people are no respecters
of other peoples property
nor indeed of other peoples jewellery
what can you be referring to monsieur
im referring to the potsdam pearls
madame
which belong to madame doyle
and which have been abducted
abducted
dérobé purloined
pinched
and why are you looking at me
in that toofamiliar continental way
what have these pearls to do with me
ah i am the nasty
little heavesdropper madame
i heard that you much admire
these pearls
that you would give every tooth
in your head to possess them
that bloody bowers
it is my theory that you have
an obsessive love of jewellery madame
that you coveted madame
doyles pearls
and that you determined to possess them
even if this meant robbery or murder
you do not deny it madame
i can picture you walking the deck
last night
waiting for madame doyle to be asleep
go to bed
quite by chance
you see the shooting in the saloon
look jackie
ill kill you first
jackie
when the room is empty you seize
the opportunity of taking the gun
you go to madame doyles cabin
knowing that her husband will not be there
you shoot her and then you take
the pearls from her bedside table
you will withdraw that
or i shall prosecute you for slander
with the utmost vigour
it will not equal the vigour
with which i shall search this boat
and in particular your cabin
madame for those pearls
i give you a good afternoon
you perfectly foul french upstart
belgian upstart please madame
was it necessary to be
so rough on the old lady
i mean really you seem to be
accusing everybody
with reason mon colonel what you
think old ladies dont commit murder
i am convinced she has the pearls
the only question is
did she kill to acquire them
monsieur choudry
marhaban hello
yes colonel
we will depart immediately
ive already given the orders
at this very moment
the engineer is building up steam
why the sudden rush
i tell you mon vieu old man i feel
the presence of evil all about me
the sooner we reach wadi halfa
the better
ill lock these up in a safe place
then we must commence our search
for the pearls
thats the last of the crews cabins
maybe she threw them overboard
you forget that we have not yet
examined penningtons cabin
thats right lets do it now
ahoy there
so our journey is continuing
good afternoon madame
will you not join me
for a little refreshment
this marvellous little man here
has just made me
the most extraordinary concoction
out of native fruit juices
its called a golden sobek
and is named after the god of
the ancient city of crocodilopolis
not for me thank you very much
sometimes i do take the hair of the dog
but never the scale of the crocodile
race
and how are you getting along
with your investigation
of this tragic affair
monsieur porridge
ah normalment madame
normally as they say
oh the crime passionnel
the primitive instinct to kill
so closely allied to the sex instinct
i have every sympathy
for that poor halfcrazed jackie
her emotions are a turmoil
her hot latin blood raging
to be avenged on the woman
who stole her man
yes of course but it could
have been someone else
with a motive at least as good
oh who
you madame otterbourne
what are you talking about
oh come come
both your daughter and you know
that you cannot libel the dead
now you will never have to pay
those huge damages she was asking for
yes but one would hardly kill for that
would one not
well
ill have another golden whathaveyou
you know mrs otterbourne
it is you that i can see looking
into the saloon through the windows
at that as you put it
poor halfcrazed jacqueline
shooting monsieur doyle
and then when everyone has gone
running in to take up the gun
and then stealing forth
to kill madame doyle
no my world is the world of grand love
and passionate romance
not grubby murders
now if youll please leave me alone
well if we have disturbed you
we are both desolate
life can be so cruel
you must be brave very brave
to bear the calumnies of life
here barman
this crocodile has lost its croc
what a perfectly dreadful woman
why doesnt somebody shoot her i wonder
well perhaps one day the subscribers
of the lending libraries
will club together and hire an assassin
so madame van schuyler
is foolish enough
to play games with hercule poirot
you realise of course you have
no actual proof that she stole them
the fact that the pearls have been
returned does not mean for a moment
that she did not kill
while stealing them in the first place
pennington
we must find that document he was
trying to induce madame doyle to sign
whats this
poirot
yeah
ho well that proves that mademoiselle
jackie was not the only passenger
who was travelling armed
still linnet doyle was not shot
with a thing this size
no obviously not
oh làlà làlà làlà
quelle pagaille what a mess
oh oh oh
your eyes are better tell me
what the hell is going on
were going through your private
papers sir isnt that obvious
youre what
it may be the custom in paris
to go through peoples things
but were not in paris now
brussels sir the country is
i dont care if its borneo
you have no right to be in my cabin
no right at all
we have every right
pending the arrival of the police
the company has commissioned us
to investigate this murder
which has nothing to do with my papers
on the contrary
they prove that
in spite of madame doyles marriage
you are still trying
to control her money
so what theres no law against it
there is a law against
swindling your client
and my people dont like
to see it contravened
your people who the hell are they
i represent mrs doyles english lawyers
and quite frankly were not at all happy
about the way you and your partner
have been handling her affairs
go to hell
now look here
her affairs are in perfect order
oh i wish that were true
you see i think you came over here
in order to get her signature
on this power of attorney
you failed and so you went
to the temple of amun
and you climbed
to the top of the tall pillar
there you dislodged a stone which fell
and which narrowly avoided killing her
you cant pin that on me now get out of
here ive heard enough of this garbage
you may have to one day
listen to a little more of such garbage
from the lips of a public prosecutor
oh this is yours i believe
belgium
let us change for dinner
jai faim im hungry
poirot you have a woman
femme is woman
jai faim i am peckish
oh i must have a word
with that little one
i will join you at the table
mon colonel
be good enough to order me
les morilles morel mushroom
les morilles oh morayeel
well how goes it with you
ma petite
badly monsieur poirot
i feel so ashamed
his wifes dead and
now hes available to you again
is it so wrong of me to hope
hell come back
i still love him
and now he needs me more than ever
oh monsieur poirot could i
could you arrange for me to see him
just for five minutes please
i dont see why not
that is if he wishes
and the herr doctor raises no objection
i will make some inquiries
ah gut the temperature is down
alright herr poirot ive no objection
provided the visit is short
fünf minuten at the most ja
merci docteur
mademoiselle jackie
you can see him now
oh thank you
hello jackie
simon
im very sorry about linnet
thank you
simon i didnt kill her
i swear that
you dont have to say it
i know
forgive me please
jackie
last night i was mad
i might have killed you
what with a rotten little peashooter
like that
will they be able
will you walk again
dont be a chump
as soon as we get to wadi halfa
theyll dig the damn thing out
and ill be as right as rain
ah ja yeah
remember fünf minuten ja
oh simon im so dreadfully sorry
there now
theres nothing to apologise for
questce que cest que ça
whats this
i asked for a plate of morilles
whats that when its at home
mushrooms
oh im sorry
i thought you wanted a moray eel
thats the best they could do
ive ordered you a new bottle of wine
why
because the remains of last nights bottle
was a little mouldy when he poured it out
mouldy
yes you know
it had a lot of bits in it
but thats the normal sediment
for a great bottle of château pétrus
will you join me in some
no thanks
you stick to your wine
ill stick to my whisky
you drink whisky all the wine
oh how strange of course
may i
you know poirot the way i see it
everybody could have done it
and everybody had a reason for doing it
its incredible
absolument
good evening
good evening
good evening madam please
come quick quick
fetch dr bessner
yes sir
you see what this is
money looks like a piece of a thousand
franc note it has to be blackmail
she must have known something
about linnet doyles murderer
what idiots we have been
ah nom de rien
goshdarnit
what did she say this afternoon
if i had been unable to sleep
if i had stayed on deck
i could then perhaps
have seen the assassin enter
or leave madame doyles cabin
but that is precisely what happened
she did see the assassin
and its because of her greed
that she now lies dead
much good that does us we still
dont know who killed either woman
no no no thats not quite right
you see we have been running
in the wrong direction you and i
we know almost all there is to know
except that what we know seems
seems incredible
impossible
ah killings
killings all the time killings
ja
dead no more than an hour
the throats been cut
with a very thin knife
one like this
thats very interesting doctor
are you quite sure that
none of yours are missing
was what
so now you think that i
ludwig bessner
have killed this miserable
little femme de chambre maid
oh gott im himmel
god in heaven
what do i have to do with the squalid
affairs of the lower classes
it is well known they do not have
neuroses just animal passions
take the body to the ice room
yes sir
so you think you know huh
i must confess
i dont see any real light myself
dr bessner has just told me
what happened to the maid
i must speak with you
and mr doyle at once
i wouldnt go in there if i were you
dr bessner is rather cross
my good man i know that but a little
kraut crossness wont stop me now
you see i know
mr doyle i know who
killed louise bourget
what you say you know
who killed louise
ah ja not to shout
and you frau otterbourne
you cannot be here i forbid it
my patient is resting
but i must you see
its vitally important
you see i know all all i tell you
now look i will not take
that pushing mit ellbogenelbows
mr doyle i tell you that i
salome otterbourne
have succeeded
where frail men have faltered
i am a finer sleuth
than even the great hercule porridge
mrs otterbourne
for gods sake calm down
now tell us the whole story
from the beginning
i refuse to speak in front of him
now look you will not speak at all eh
new raus raus out his temperature is
rising with all this disturbance
doctor it will rise even more
if we dont hear what she has to say
herr doyle
we are talking about
the murderer of my wife
oh ja ja alright
you can stay drei minuten
three minutes
and you now you speak softly eh
odious little man
madam do i understand that you have
evidence to show who killed mrs doyle
you do and i have
you will agree will you not
that whoever killed louise bourget
also killed linnet doyle
that is quite possible
well
i saw who killed louise bourget
with my own eyes
pray continue madame
i happened to be in the stern
of the boat talking to one of the crew
who was showing me
a most intriguing sight
a buffalo and a camel yoked together
tilling the soil
you saw this by moonlight
of course madame
yes i did
i have amazingly good eyesight
anyway i left him
and suddenly as i rounded the corner
i heard a scream
it came from louise bourgets cabin
then i saw the cabin door open
as the door opened wider
i saw that it was
penningtons
i heard a big boom
what now has happened
mrs otterbournes been shot
mr pennington
yes
this is your gun i believe
anybody could have taken that gun from my cabin
everybody knew it was there
i was saying just the other night
i always carry a gun with me on my travels abroad
it is time for these murders to stop
already i have unfortunately
delayed too long
i would like to see everybody
please in the saloon
when all will be revealed
in er 30 minutes
i cant believe it mother dead
why
she must have found something out
oh god poor darling
i loved her in spite of it all
and now shes gone
i cant take it in
suddenly im
all alone
no youre not
ill look after you
oh jim
poor mother
youd never have got away from her
not while she was alive
madame mesdemoiselles messieurs
the game is over
i hercule poirot now know
beyond a shadow of a doubt
who killed madame doyle louise bourget
and madame otterbourne
foolishly i began this investigation
with the preconceived idea
that there must have been a witness
to the shooting scene between
mademoiselle jackie and simon doyle
that this person must have taken
the gun from here
after everyone had left the saloon
and must have used it
to kill madame doyle
and to attempt to frame
mademoiselle jackie
you see mes amis
my friends
it is not as though there were
any lack of suspects among you
she might have been killed by someone
trying to shut her defamatory mouth
or by someone whose father had been
ruined by madame doyles father
or by someone obsessed
with the idea of robbery
or by someone who bitterly resented
anyone inheriting that amount of money
or by someone who was desperately
trying to save her mother
from financial ruin
or yet
by someone anxious to escape
exposure as a fraudulent trustee
or by someone who simply mistook
the identity of the victim
and then i remembered
something very important
on the night of the killing
i slept heavily
not lightly as is my custom
why
because my wine had been drugged
by someone who did not wish me to be
present at the nights events
this was the easiest thing in the world
the bottles stand open on the
dining room table all day long
you mon colonel
you even sent the bottle back
saying to use your words
that it was mouldy
and this in itself plainly implies
premeditation on someones part
it means that yesterday before 730
when dinner was served
the crime had already been decided upon
i began to think back on something that has
been puzzling me from the beginning
if the intention was to implicate
mademoiselle jackie
why had the gun been removed
from madame doyles cabin
and then i understood
the murderer had removed the gun
because he or she had to remove it
there was no other course
and there was more
dr bessner
you examined madame doyles body
ja
you will remember that there were
signs of scorching round the wound
in other words
the gun had been placed very close
to her head before being fired
that is correct
but when we recovered
the gun from the nile
it was wrapped in this
brocade stole
and had evidently been fired
through its folds
presumably in order to deaden
the sound of the shot
dr bessner if it had been fired
through the stole
there would have been no scorching
on madame doyles temple
in other words the shot that killed
madame doyle could not have been fired
through the stole
and then perhaps
it was the other one
the one which jacqueline
de bellefort fired at simon doyle
jackie
but no we have a witness for that
we know its not so
therefore there was a third shot
one of which we know nothing
but there were only two shots
missing from the gun
the next curious circumstance occurred
in madame doyles cabin
in it i found two bottles
of coloured nail polish
one bottle was labelled rose but
the few drops remaining in that bottle
were not pale pink
but bright red
and instead of the usual smell
of pear drops vinegar
mes amis it was red ink
which formed an inevitable link
with this handkerchief
which we found
together with the gun
wrapped up in the stole
and ink washes easily out of linen
leaving a pale pink stain
then something happened which put
the matter beyond all doubt
louise bourget was killed because
she was blackmailing the murderer
we know this not only because of
the fragment of a thousand franc note
which we found clutched
between her dead fingers
but also because of some
rather curious words she used
only this morning
naturally
if id been unable to sleep
naturally if i had
been unable to sleep
if i had stayed on deck
i might then perhaps have seen the
assassin enter or leave madames cabin
now what exactly did that tell us
what exactly did she tell
us with that
that she had stayed on deck
she did see the murderer
yes but you still fail to see
my point mon colonel excuse me
why did she say that to us
as a hint
as a hint of course
but why hint to us
she knows who the murderer is
alright she can do one of two things
she can tell us
or else she can keep quiet
and demand money
from the person concerned later
but she does
neither of these two things
she uses the conditional tense
if you please if i had been
this can mean only one thing
shes hinting alright yes
but shes hinting to the murderer
in other words
he was present at the time
but apart from you and me
only one other person was present
precisely simon doyle
what
yes you are under the constant
supervision of dr bessner
she had to speak then
she might not have got another chance
dont be so bloody ridiculous
bloody rid oh i dont think im being ridiculous
i remember very clearly your answer
i will look after you
no one is accusing you of anything
this is exactly the assurance
that she wanted and which she got
oh mr p you really have made a fool
of yourself this time and no mistake
i mean ive got plenty of witnesses to prove
that i couldnt possibly have killed linnet
i know you have
but you did kill her
and louise bourget saw you
oh what nonsense
i tell you that herr doyle
could not have moved about the boat
with a fractured leg
i tell you that i ludwig bessner
would testify to this
to any court in the world
in that case i would have to say
that your testimony is irrelevant
irrelevant
unanwendbar
unanwendbar me
i have testified
in some of the most complex
psychological cases of the century
my testimony alone saved
strutzrumple
the dresden sachertorte murderer
from execution
and in the case
calmezvous calmezvous
your testimony is irrelevant because
you started to tend to monsieur doyle
five minutes after he had been shot
but i tell you he could not have
moved during those five minutes
i agree if hed been shot at
that time but had he been
consider what had actually
been seen
mademoiselle rosalie saw
jacqueline fire her pistol
she saw doyle collapse to the ﬂoor
and then turning away to seek help
she ran into monsieur ferguson
who had heard the shot
all he saw was doyle clutching
a redstained handkerchief to his leg
he quite naturally assumed
that doyle had been shot
but the assumption was wrong
the bullet had not gone into doyle
but elsewhere
and now what happens
doyle insists that jackie be taken away
to her cabin and not be left alone
and so jackie is helped
to her cabin
by mademoiselle rosalie
and monsieur ferguson
then mademoiselle rosalie
goes to fetch miss bowers
accordingly
all the activity is centred
on the starboard side
of the boat
miss bowers
two minutes are all
that doyle needs
he takes of his shoes
picks up the gun from under the sofa
where jackie had
thoughtfully thrown it
so that it would be forgotten
until later
and runs like a hare
along the port deck
he then enters his wifes cabin
doyle then takes madame van schuylers
stole which he had previously hidden
and wrapping up the gun in it
in order both to muffle sound
and to prevent scorching
fires a bullet into his own leg
he removes one of the spent cartridges
which he disposes of
and inserts a fresh one thus
indicating should the gun be found
that only two bullets
had been fired from it
he then rewraps the gun in the stole
adds the stained handkerchief
and a marble ashtray to make sure
that it all sinks to the bottom
and throws the whole bundle
out of the window into the nile
and now he lies back
on the sofa
clasping a fresh handkerchief
to his leg
this time in genuine agony
cest extraordinaire
nestce pas
its impossible
i can scarcely believe it
of course it is
absolutely bloody impossible
why do you say its impossible
you yourself told me
that you heard softly running feet
what reason was there for
anyone to run
yes i know but to do all that
on the spur of the moment
once and for all mon colonel
it was not on the spur of the moment
it was carefully planned
by doyle
oh doyle he merely acted the part
it was planned by his accomplice
mademoiselle jacqueline de bellefort
you must be mad
no im not mad
thats the truth
who gave doyle his alibi
you did by firing that shot
and who gave you your alibi
doyle by insistingb that
someone stay with you all night
its not true its not
it is true why bother to deny it
you and doyle were lovers
you still are lovers
the plan was that simon would kill
his wife inherit the money
and then aftewvards at some later date
marry his old love
it was a very brilliant concept
your persecution of madame doyle
simons feigned rage
your selection of mademoiselle rosalie
as a witness
and all that buildup to the shooting
the exaggerated hysteria
there was only one risk
you really took
and that was that simons wound
simply had to be disabling
oh and er pardon me
but one piece of foolishness
which was the drawing of the letter j
on the wall of the cabin
so melodramatic it could only have
one effect
that of exonerating you
and who would want to do that
except an accomplice
but then the plan began
to go wrong did it not
louise bourget has
been wakeful
she sees doyle
run into his wifes cabin
she hears the shot and sees
him return to the saloon
she makes her greedy bid
for hush money
and in doing so
signs her own death wanant
herr doyle could not have killed her
because he could not have moved
i will swear to that
you would be right
she was killed by mademoiselle jackie
no
yes i am afraid there is no doubt
just before dinner
she asked to see monsieur doyle
quite foolishly as it turns out
i agreed and brought them together
the one apparently guiltridden
and distraught the other comforting
oh simon im so dreadfully sorry
there now
however im sure as soon as
weve gone the tone changes
its going fine darling
were nearly there
like hell it is louise knows
she saw me
shes trying to blackmail us
ill have to shut her up
cant we pay her
all our lives
jackie are you sure
give me some money
why
thats what shes waiting for
itll put her off guard where is it
in my jacket in the wardrobe
i love you
i know
are we insane
oh i dont know
but we cant stop now
jackie
wish me luck
unfortunately for her
in her haste
she leaves a tiny fragment
of a thousand franc note behind
clutched in the dead
womans fingers
but even more unfortunately
she is seen by madame otterbourne
leaving the cabin
she is unaware of this at the time
and returns to dr bessners cabin
to replace the scalpel
then having changed for dinner
somewhat ﬂushed and out of breath
she hurries into the dining room
as for madame otterbourne
when she hears of the murder
of louise bourget from dr bessner
she suddenly realises that she has
actually seen the murderer
leaving the scene of the crime
what you say you know
who killed louise
calm not to shout
and you frau
you cannot be here i forbid it
it seemed strange to me
at the time
that doyle should be shouting
so loudly at madame otterbourne
now of course
i realise that what he was doing
was shouting a warning to jackie
next door
mrs otterbourne for gods sake
calm down
now tell us the whole story
from the beginning
and why did he ask her to start at
the beginning and tell the whole story
obviously to give jackie time to act
which she did like lightning
herr doyle
we are talking about
the murderer of my wife
mr pennington
she boasted once that her father
had taught her to be a crack shot
and her boast was not an idle one
i saw it
she dropped the gun and
bolted into her own cabin next door
it was highly risky
but it was her only possible chance
voila mes amis that is all
congratulations mr p
on a highly amusing theory
oh its more than a theory
unfortunately it is the truth
then what happened to the first bullet
the one that jackie fired at me
oh thats a good question yes
can you all see this table
theres a newlymade bullet hole
just there
of course you had time to dispose of
the bullet and throw it into the nile
what pifﬂe
oh no its not pifﬂe
remember we have proof
that all three bullets came
from mademoiselle jacquelines gun
suppose thats true monsieur poirot
wheres the proof
that simon fired the other two
well thats right youve no proof
youve absolutely no proof at all
well produce some never fear
you wont get away with this
no well youll never convince
a jury without proof
and where do you intend to get it mr p
from linnet
oh no not from linnet
from you
from me what do you mean
its a bluff simon
its very far from being a bluff
there is a very simple test
which is now accepted as conclusive
evidence in any court in the world
its called a moulage test
moulage test
yes moulage
you know when you fire a gun
tiny grains of powder become embedded
in the skin
and they can now be removed
by a thin layer of wax
thats a moulage test
oh mon colonel
will you administer this
when you wish
i assume of course that youre
willing to submit to such a test
there is no pain involved
just a little warmth
jackie what
what can we do
nothing its over
i dont mind so much monsieur
about me i mean
you do mind dont you a bit
yes
and dont judge simon too harshly
he never had any money
and linnet simply dazzled him
with all that wealth
simon do you remember what you said
i said if this was a book
id marry linnet and shed die
within a year and leave me everything
thats when i saw the idea
come into his head
i was terrified i knew
hed try some perfectly absurd way
he even had the idea
of putting a cobra in her bed
well you found another use
for that serpent mademoiselle
im glad it didnt kill you monsieur
ooof
truly
so you
you see
i had to help him
ive always had to help him
oh jackie i love you
i love you
stop
monsieur poirot
quelle tragédie
a splendid piece of detection
poirot i must say
you know i couldnt possibly have
carried out that moulage test
i have no wax
you astonish me mon colonel
you absolutely astonish me
goodbye monsieur poirot
im afraid the description
of your cases
will have to wait until another time
oh quel dommage madame
a pity
i was hoping to recount to you
my recent extraordinary experience
on the orient express
come on bowers time to go
this place is beginning
to resemble a mortuary
thank god youll be in one yourself
before too long
bloody old fossil
temper temper bowers
what you need is a nice cool holiday
i was thinking of a trip
through the gobi desert
monsieur poirot
i wanted you to be the first to know
weve just got engaged
oh mes félicitations mademoiselle
monsieur
congratulations
and bonne chance to both of you
thank you
goodbye monsieur poirot
goodbye sir
colonel race
good luck
oh mes petits a word of advice
kids
as they say in america take it easy
well try
what are you thinking
i was thinking of moliére
la grande ambition des femmes
est dinspiner lamour
