gregory  come baaack 
my power returns with the rise of the blood moon 
hell awakens 
  is master gregory here 
  partially 
master gregory  do you not hear the bells 
the bells are ringing in my ear 
in the village in the old church  there is
a child no more than ten years of age 
she is    infected 
you may note i am presently
not dealing with the other worldly 
on your feet  sir  since you re
requested for duty 
my only oath is to this stool 
it s an oath i intend not to break 
the mark on your hand tells me you re a knight 
have you no honor 
this man says an innocent is at risk 
  and you do nothing 
  on the contrary 
i m doing my best to ignore him 
  i beg of you  do not do this 
  don t worry  boy  this won t be an execution 
merely an education 
fill it 
i was begging for your life  not his 
the trick is not to feeding him with a cup 
the trick is not to spill 
thank you 
mr  bradley  why you do not tell me
the bells are ringing 
apologies  master

  come on 
the ward residence 
who is asking 
i understand there is a seventh
son of the seventh son   that lives here 
do not say there is not  for i know that there is 
i m in a hurry 
bit hungry as well 
my compliments to the cook 
you re welcome 
so    
which one is the seventh 
what is your name  boy 
thomas ward 
he is strong  does a lot of work
around the farm 
the deeming has begun 
that s the man    from my visions 
it s too dangerous 
  he is a spook 
  it is a noble profession 
and your last apprentice  and the one before him 
what happened to them 
  and now you come here for my son 
  i m supposed to go with him 
he s a bit scrawny for a seventh son 
i dreaded the thought of this day   
   but i knew it would come 
then you understand 
i know you better than you think i do  tom 
be wise 
be careful 
remember   all you ever need  is inside you 
just don t be afraid to look 
the pendant  that i can t take   
wear it 
always 
keep him safe 
alas  good lady  that is a vow i cannot make 
my queen 
  at last  you have returned 
  the spook  what has he done to you 
not just me  all of us 
burned  starved  and forced into hiding 
the spook has no mercy 
my spial follows him 
you need not fear gregory any longer 
my beauuutiful sissster 
thank you  my queen 
make way  make way 
it is near impossible to battle demons
with wet feet 
here 
this is to beat your boots paced 
i will pick up provisions 
  provisions 
  liquids 
need it to ward off evil spirits 
fermented liquids 
if i forget  pick up grease  salt  flour and bacon 
starting to wish i was the sixth son 
burn that witch 
wait 
if she is a witch  then i count it off with her 
who are you  
i am master gregory s apprentice 
it s true  i saw the spook going into the tavern 
and in my expert opinion   
   she is extremely dangerous 
  shall we touch your master 
  no  no  i can take her away and dispose her 
but i ll need salt  flour and grease 
and throw in some bacon as payment 
so what are you going
to do with me  mr  apprentice 
i m not sure yet 
  you don t believe that i m a witch 
  you don t look like a witch 
do you really think you ll make it as a spook 
that s the idea 
you seem too nice 
you know that all of his apprentices
were killed  don t you 
what s your name 
  tom  what s yours 
  i ll tell you next time 
  next time 
  i read fortunes 
we will meet again  just don t tell
your master about me 
why not 
you don t like secrets 
  close your eyes 
  why 
just    close your eyes 
mother 
yes  it s me 
  how is it possible  you look    
  is this your daughter 
are you a loyal girl  like your mother 
so this is your spy that follows gregory 
i like her shoes 
a human father 
lizzie  you surprise me 
help yourself to the blood cakes  little one 
they give you strength 
soon the blood moon will be full 
and as it grows stronger  so do all of us 
we must call the others 
pendel mountain welcomes you  brothers and sisters 
your queen has returned 
do not dally  mr  ward 
what kind of forest is this 
when you address me   address me
as master gregory 
so  um    master gregory    if  um   
if i m your new apprentice    
   what happened to the old one 
  wrong question 
wrong questions  get wrong answers 
so he s dead 
it s just a gast  level six creature 
these woods are filled with them 
try not to upset it  he ll leaves you alone 
what do you know of what a    spook actually done 
you kill creatures of the dark 
your answer    could fill me with confidence 
we deal with creatures of the dark 
some are less harmful  such as gasts 
the most dangerous  such as witches 
we trap or kill 
my last apprentice wrote this all down 
yeah  he s dead 
well  i   i m just saying  maybe he
didn t do everything right 
william bradley was the finest apprentice i ve ever had 
he died at the hands of mother malkin 
the witch queen  thought she was just a legend 
you live in the world now  where
legend and nightmare are real 
malkin is alive 
we journey to her fortress in pendel mountain 
where she no doubt hides 
mr ward 
you passed out 
you ve spells  boy  what kind 
sometimes i   
   i see things 
things that haven t happened yet 
could be of use  too 
not the passing out part of course 
but the visions  perhaps 
  what is that 
  you mean  who  
this is tusk  as loyal as he is ugly 
these things that you see in your visions    
   can you alter them or they are fixed 
i    i don t know  i am merely trying 
with a little help    most of life s curses can be a gift 
here are my beauties  returned  as i knew
they would 
tend of them  tusk 
  what is this place 
  home sweet home 
this is incredible 
we must arm ourselves for the
journey to pendel mountain 
come  mr ward 
the falcons 
an order of noble knights who dedicated
to combating the forces of darkness   
   and responsible for passing their knowledge and
skills to other seventh sons of seventh sons 
it    it says here that there are thousands of you 
that is a very old tapestry 
they all died or returned to darkness 
when you deal with dark  dark gets in you 
so    you re the only one left 
so you are the only one left  master gregory 
thank you    for reminding me 
  how long does this apprenticeship suppose to last 
  ten years 
for my last apprentice 
but for you  i have less than one week 
  why so short 
  that is when the blood moon will be full 
happens once a century 
the last time it started many years of war 
witches laid waste to cities 
the world is still recovering 
if we do not stop mother malkin 
before the next red moon sets   
  how can we    possibly   
  enough  no more questions 
we leave at dawn  stay in your chamber 
master gregory  if you want me to learn 
you have to explain things 
no time  we must get to pendel mountain
before malkin sends her dominion 
there are witches that need killing 
keen witches 
help me 
heeeelp meeeee   
help 
you were told to stay in your chamber 
that was your first test  mr  ward 
and not surprisingly  you failed 
test number two 
the rowan staff  cut by the first falcon knight 
finest fighting staff there is 
master it  then can you master any weapon 
show what you are 
i paid good money for you  i think your father
deceived me of your worth 
are not you the seventh son of the seventh son  
you ought to be seven times as strong
as a normal man 
your mom    she did not put much of a fight
to keep you  did she 
you re worthless 
there is not enough time  you ll be dead in a week 
good aim 
i was aiming for your head 
missed 
teach me 
please 
to the blood moon s rise and malkin s arrival   
   the creatures of the dark will be
more frequent and more powerful 
these are her lieutenants 
this is radu  he has an army of assassins 
throw the knife 
go 
salt  and iron  they are crucial 
salt glows  iron leads away the strength
of any creature of the dark 
tincture of copper  for flesh wounds 
silverbane  repels witches 
ogre scrotum  for your own enjoyment  follow 
  stone chuckers  they not to be confused
with cattle rippers    what s the difference 
stone chuckers chuck stones 
cattle rippers rip cattle 
they names are fairly self evident 
verbanum  guards against spells 
  that is disgusting  what does that kill 
  cowardice 
sarakin  takes the form of a leopard 
virahadra is the king of swords 
you consistency is admirable  mr  ward 
of all of them  malkin is the strongest 
she is the queen 
you know  i ve seen    mother malkin
in my visions 
this gonna take a lot more than    salt
and iron to defeat her 
you leave malkin to me 
continue your studies 
my queen 
a gift to commemorate your return 
my finest assassins 
radu    you spoil me 
you must keep your gifts 
you will need them more than i 
have you forgotten 
there are spooks buried all over this mountain 
who thought they could slay me 
when the blood moon if full 
gregory will be the next 
did you forget me 
never  never look at me 
your finest assassins 
you may keep them 
mother 
she is dangerous 
she is my sister 
she healed me  alice 
by the time the moon is full 
she will rule this land 
and we will be there by her side 
no hiding from men  no more fearing them 
just fearing her 
i would never let her hurt you 
now go  keep an eye on that spook 
what are you doing here 
swimming  in moonlight 
turn around 
what was that 
it is said that when a witch
first touches by moonlight   
the man with whom she s
meant to walk hand in hand    
   there is a blue spark 
so you are a witch 
my father is a gypsy  and my mother is a witch 
so that makes me a witch 
she is all i have 
we re not all evil  you know  that s your master
would have you believe 
some of us are good 
some are bad 
and the rest are simply unaware 
and what kind are you 
so where are you headed 
the pendel mount 
why do you want to be like him 
he treats you worse than a dog 
calls witches  abominations 
have you been spying on us 
yes 
for whom 
someone who calls people abominations 
what is that 
that    is tusk 
he s having a bad dream by the sounds of it 
i wonder what monsters have nightmares about 
humans  probably 
have you been writin  down what you have learned
in your journal  as i have instructed 
  i ve a good memory for facts 
  do you now 
you remember the difference
between a ghost and a gast 
a ghost is a full spirit  a gast is a fragment
of a spirit that moved on 
correct 
tusk 
aim  tusk  for god s sake 
  what is that 
  the bell 
i m being summoned 
tusk  just make yourself scarce 
  are you gregory  
  that depend on who s inquiring 
you are cordially invited to the walled city 
the inquisitor has instructed me
to return you there  now 
that will cost us two days journey 
if it s anything less than a boggart  we are on our way 
  what is a boggart 
  you do not want to know 
the devil is upon us 
there will be slaughter 
the signs of evil are everywhere 
and now we have this beast  unlike anything
we have seen before 
no priest dares go near it 
i thought perhaps you might    better protect us 
flattery is fine  gold is finer 
  it feels a bit light 
  you ll get the rest when the job is done 
of course 
malkin s most bloodthirsty lieutenant 
he has killed more of my kind  than
all the rest altogether 
his name is urag 
it took three regiments to secure the creature 
  that was the only one to survive 
  leave us 
secure the doors 
i fight him alone 
  why 
  ancient code of honor 
more important thing  i prefer
not to split the reward 
you ve chosen the wrong profession  boy 
the cage  grab him in the cage 
jump 
silverbane 
we are not finished  oil 
we must kill him for good 
throw the cauldron 
do it 
unless you prefer to eat his heart 
i can t do this 
i m not like you 
not yet 
but you will be 
send them away 
i am training you to kill witches 
if you cannot do that  you are useless to me 
yes  that s right  go soak  boy 
hold 
  my queen 
  sarakin 
virahadra  king of swords 
strix  my brave warlock 
good  now all are here but urag 
where is he 
where is your master 
what s wrong 
i can t do what he does 
good 
is it 
to be no good at something bad is good 
it s not that simple 
i looked up in an old spell book
about blue spark 
sometimes it s about destiny 
sometimes it s just   dust on witches  fingers 
so it    didn t mean anything 
your master was in love with a witch once 
when he was very young 
  we all have secrets 
  what s yours 
close your eyes 
close your eyes 
i want to stay here forever 
a failed spook and a half witch 
what would we do 
oh  my mother taught me how to steal 
  i m rather good at it  when i want to be 
  that you are 
don t laugh 
what would you have us do 
let me take you away from here 
somewhere safe  somewhere    
   somewhere where none of this matters 
that sounds nice 
but there is no place holding that 
i have to go back to him 
i don t wanna leave you 
you can t hide from destiny 
i too was once young 
did not listen  was arrogant  like you 
i once loved a witch 
yes  malkin 
she was not always evil 
fear and hatred created her 
she grew in to what she was perceived to be  deadly 
once she    discovered that i had married    
she could not endure all my happiness 
she    murdered my wife in cold blood 
i captured her 
i was clever  i lied to her 
told her i still loved her 
i    had my chance to kill her  but
i showed her mercy instead 
tricked her  locked away in a cage
buried under ground 
i thought that prison would hold her to eternity 
but i was wrong 
wrong  everyone she kills in her wake is my burden 
i want you to meet my wife  mr  ward 
this    is rebecca 
this    is why i ve been so hard on you  tom 
do not    make the same mistake 
if you see a witch    kill it 
my daughter has spotted them  they moving closer 
you may do as you wish  with the boy  my darling   
i want gregory 
alive 
beyond the forest   pendel mountain  still three days 
tusk 
dependable as death you are 
  what the hell was that 
  a boggart 
subterranean beast  nasty temper  blind as a bat 
  how do you fight a boggart 
  you don t  you run 
tusk  run 
follow 
  you taught boggarts are blind  
  their sense of smell  extraordinary 
jump 
we seem to be having a boggart problem 
much thanks 
don t worry  we re safe now 
boggarts  they hate water 
mr ward 
mr  ward 
on the subject of boggarts 
i m beginning to find you a tad unreliable 
tom 
alice has no place in your thoughts 
your master wants to hunt us  burn us 
eat our hearts 
how about i feed you your own 
the stone  it belongs to my queen 
how did you get it 
don t get up  i m fine 
i m fine  i was just killing that
enormous    scary    monsters 
you do not die easy  do you  mr  ward 
and you slay the inslayable 
  where did you get that 
  my mother gave it to me 
what s funny 
you  mr  ward 
  what s this thing 
  that thing  the umbranstone 
the witches  most sacred talisman 
it strengthens their powers 
makes their illusions seem more real 
why would my mom have it 
mother malkin  she had the stone once 
in her hand it has tremendous power 
but it was stolen from her by another witch 
only then was i able to defeat her  to trap her 
are you telling me that my mother is a witch 
so that is what you are 
a witches  son who is a spook s apprentice 
now that s funny 
that must account your visions 
come on 
we have a job to do 
what happened to urag 
he burned him alive 
i m sorry you had to witness that 
spook is a cruel man 
he would do the same to you  if he had the chance 
so with that    apprentice 
tom is good 
  such a shame he will die 
  i don t want him to die 
we could save him 
tom loves you 
your mother saw it in his heart 
even a umbranstone cannot hide such thing 
your mother found it  around tom s neck 
get back what was stolen from me 
and your boy will be spared 
how do i know you are telling the truth 
get it back 
let us show them what we do
to cities that burn witches 
we will avenge our brother s death 
let us give the world a taste of what is to come 
mum  what s that 
hell  it s here 
  i m going back 
  no 
keep her safe 
mam 
a witch defend this city 
that witch 
treacherous thief 
you abandoned your people while we
were being destroyed 
and for what 
they will hate you once they know what you are 
you gave away the one thing
that could have saved you 
and that gift will be the death of your son 
you are a slave to darkness  mother malkin 
not it s queen 
  you do the shopping for the pain 
  no 
make it more human 
we ve lost all our possessions  but
somehow you still have that 
that s good luck  i guess 
you must never have more than
one sip of this a day 
  why not 
  because it is mine 
resilient as you are ugly  old friend
what  what is it 
something wrong 
stay here  we will look ahead 
  come on 
  i have to stay here  they ll be back soon 
i ve changed my mind 
let s run away 
do you love me 
yes 
mr  ward  go gather wood  we re going to have a fire 
tom  please 
i said  get the wood 
stand back  sir 
  don t make me do this 
  she s a spy 
  she is not the enemy 
  we have a mission  mr  ward 
this is your most important test 
  right now 
  don t hurt him 
run 
damn it  boy  the stone 
she s stolen it 
now tell me she is innocent 
i not lose this one 
tom  grab the staff 
sadly  gregory  my orders are to deliver you alive 
mom    
i don t understand 
  how can you be here 
  i m not  tom 
i passed on from this world 
i stood against mother malkin 
and i failed 
but you will not fail 
you re a seventh son  tom 
but you are also the son of a witch 
there is never been anyone like you 
only you can wheel the umbranstone   
   and end her reign of darkness before it begins 
empty your heart of grief 
fill it with courage 
you re ready now 
go 
find the stone 
fight 
you don t die easy  do you 
we have the master  where is the apprentice 
  dead  smashed on the rocks 
  what 
i told them to follow you 
you would never do that 
i did it for you 
look at your queen  and find peace 
gregory 
tonight    
   his reign of terror ends 
join us 
you and i will rule this world 
united    for eternity 
look    at me 
look at me 
the darkness is in you now 
join us 
for a worthy enemy   
   now honored and welcome 
the war is over 
now we are together 
traitor 
don t kill her  please 
mother 
where is my stone 
i lost it 
i took it to protect you 
you fight me as a dragon  not as a man 
have you no honor 
you know nothing of dragons 
or true honor 
should have stayed a dragon 
what have you done 
she s everything to me 
i thought betrayal was a sin
only committed by humans 
alone   
i do this alone 
i was a fool 
you tricked me 
so you could trap me in that hole 
you made me believe that you loved me 
i truly loved you once 
that is still there 
gone 
as my hatred is 
i    will    haunt    you 
in the old days    
   there was a ceremony 
flags magnificent horns 
too bad it s sitting just the two of us 
did it hurt 
no 
so you choose this life 
it chose me 
and the blue spark    
it was just dust 
do what you will 
i know how you feel 
we will meet again 
time has come  mr  ward 
goodbye  tusk 
forgive me 
perhaps i was not clear  it is i who ride 
this is now your home 
i trust you will take care of it 
and tusk 
yes  old friend 
  where will you go 
  wrong question 
wrong questions give wrong answers 
tusk  give us a hand 
remember what i taught you 
ignore it
