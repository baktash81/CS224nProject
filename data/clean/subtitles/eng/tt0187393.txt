the new york and
pennsylvania assemblies
are debating independence
what about the middle colonies
in chestertown
they burned the customs house
and tar and feathered
two magistrates
they died of they died of burns
damn fools
who the writers or the magistrates
what does it say about
the continental congress
it says here theyll make
a declaration of independence by july
peter cuppin joined the continentals
hes 17 a year younger than i
well the assemblys been convened
so ive been called to charles town
were going to charles town
we are
we leave in the morning
charlotte
the children are here
thank you
aunt charlotte
margaret william look at you
missed you
theyre huge
what have you been feeding them
well theyre from good stock
on their mothers side of course
thank you come inside
wait until you see what i have
presents presents for us
move slowly
keep an eye on these heathens
will you
sorry
i have this for you susan
it belonged to your mother
shes still not talking
no
it does me good to see you
look theres gabriel
gabriel
hang king george
harry burwell is here recruiting
the governor has vowed if the
assembly votes a single shilling
to the continental army
hell dissolve the body
wouldnt that force our delegates in
philadelphia to vote for independence
yes
send us off to war alongside
massachusetts
get king george
hang them all
hang the lot of them
thats enough
very well children inside
come along now inside now
burwell will be counting on your vote
and hell expect you
to be the first to enlist
yes i imagine so
im sorry the heathens are
they have long needed
a woman in their lives
a mother
especially susan
my name is peter howard
i lost most of my hearing
and my left leg
fighting for the crown
in the french and indian war
and how did king george reward me
he cuts off my other leg
with his taxes
miss howard isnt it
you know who i am gabriel martin
the last time you saw me
i was 11 and you put ink in my tea
i believe that was one of my younger
brothers perhaps samuel or nathan
it was you and it turned
my teeth black for a month
and send a message to king george
he will never forget
our first order of business
and our last if we vote a levy
order order
mr simms you do not have the floor
first an address by colonel
harry burwell of the continental army
colonel burwell
you all know why im here
im not an orator
and i would not try to convince you
of the worthiness of our cause
im a soldier
and we are at war
from philadelphia we expect
a declaration of independence
8 of the 13 colonies have
levied money
in support of a continental army
i ask that south carolina be the ninth
massachusetts and virginia
may be at war
but south carolina is not
hear hear
this is not a war for the independence
of one or two colonies
but for the independence
of one nation
and what nation is that
an american nation
there is no such nation
and to speak of one is treason
we are citizens
of an american nation
and our rights are being threatened
by a tyrant 3000 miles away
would you tell me please
mr howard
why should i trade one tyrant
3000 miles away
for 3000 tyrants one mile away
an elected legislature can trample
a mans rights as easily as a king can
captain martin
i understood you to be a patriot
if you mean by patriot am i angry
about taxation without representation
well yes i am
should the american colonies govern
themselves independently
i believe they can and they should
but if youre asking me am i willing
to go to war with england
then the answer is
most definitely no
this from the same captain benjamin
martin whose fury was so famous
during the wilderness campaign
i was intemperate in my youth
temperance can be
a disguise for fear
mr middleton i fought
with captain martin
under washington
in the french and indian war
theres not a man in this room
or anywhere for that matter to whom
i would more willingly trust my life
there are alternatives to war
we take our case before the king
we plead with him
we tried
well then we try again and again
if necessary to avoid a war
i was at bunker hill
the british advanced three times
we killed 700 at pointblank range
and still they took the ground
that is the measure of their resolve
if your principles dictate
independence
then war is the only way
it is come to that
hear hear
i have seven children
my wife is dead
now whos to care for them
if i go to war
wars are not fought
only by childless men
granted
but mark my words
this war will be fought
not on the frontier
or on some distant battlefield
but amongst us
among our homes
our children will learn of it
with their own eyes
and the innocent will die
with the rest of us
i will not fight
and because i will not fight
i will not cast a vote
that will send others to fight
in my stead
and your principles
im a parent i havent got
the luxury of principles
we must vote to levy
28 to 12 the levy passed
you intend to enlist
without my permission
yes i do
father i thought you were
a man of principle
when you have a family of your own
perhaps youll understand
when i have a family of my own
i wont hide behind them
hes as imprudent as his father was
at his age
regrettably so
ill see to it that he
serves under me
make him a clerk or quartermaster
something of that sort
good luck
dear thomas
though many seasons have passed
it seems like only yesterday when we
last saw each other in charles town
with sadness i learned
of its recent fall to the british
under general cornwallis
i received a letter
from aunt charlotte
saying she closed her home
in charles town after the city fell
and moved to her plantation
on the santee
here in the north our campaign has
been marked by defeat and privation
our losses have been grievous
my good friend peter cuppin
fell at elizabethtown
his death has been difficult to bear
we will march south
with general gates
to fight the redcoats
under cornwallis
thank you sir
i envy you
your youth and distance from this
cruel conflict of which i am a part
but i am fortunate to be
serving the cause of liberty
and though i fear death
each day in prayer i reaffirm
my willingness
to give my life in its service
pray for me
but above all pray for the cause
your loving brother gabriel
what are you doing

by order of king george
all slaves of the american colonies
who fight for the crown
will be granted their freedom

the privilege
of fighting in the kings army
rebel dispatches sir

colonel this is a uniformed
dispatch rider carrying a marked case
he cannot be held as a spy

colonel
father

something of loyalty

by the rules of war

how many were there
were they militia
were they regulars
i dont really remember how many
maybe one
one man really
he was in the flank
all around us
amongst us
i could barely see him
he was there then he was gone
he just vanished
sounds more like a ghost than a man
a ghost
he was like a ghost
enough
bordon take a patrol
capture this ghost before
word of his exploits spread
whos this
sir this is captain wilkins
he was with the loyalist colonial
militia he might be of use
another colonial
captain wilkins
where do your loyalties lie
to king and country
why should i trust a man whod
betray his neighbors
those neighbors of mine who stand
against england
deserve to die a traitors death

in open field its madness
halt

present
fire
this battle was over before it began
retreat
retreat
these rustics are so inept
nearly takes the honor
out of victory
nearly
hello general gentlemen
a glorious day
for his majesty and england
colonel tavington
always too early
always too eager for glory
for victory my lord
i believe we took the field
next time youll wait
for my command
it appears that colonel tavington
prefers to follow his own commands
general ohara tells me
youve earned the nickname
the butcher among the populous
well discuss it tomorrow
gentlemen my compliments
to a victory
hear hear
hold him firm
wheres your commanding officer
that tent there
its a lost cause
benjamin martin
im in no mood for a lecture
wheres your general gates now
the last anyone saw
riding hard northeast
his staff 100 yards behind
trying to catch up
so whos in command
i am
i think
what are my orders
were a breath away from losing
this war benjamin
in the north washington is
reeling from morristown
hes running and hiding
from 12000 redcoats
in the south cornwallis has
broken our back
captured over 5000 of our troops
when he took charles town
and he destroyed the only army
between him and new york
nothing will stop him from
heading north to finish off washington
unless we can keep cornwallis
in the south till the french arrive
theyve promised a fleet
and 10000 troops
when
six months at the earliest
you trust the french
to keep their word
absolument
benjamin martin
major jean villeneuve
french seventh light foot
he will help train the militia
the hero of fort wilderness
your reputation precedes you
you really expect to hold cornwallis
here using just militia
not me you
theyre not soldiers theyre farmers
theyd be better off letting
the british march through
theyd be better off
but the cause wouldnt
how many men
does cornwallis have
8000 infantry
around 600 cavalry
im giving you a field commission
as a colonel
might i request that you transfer
my son under my command
sir no i
thats done
thank you
colonel ive been a soldier
for two years
as a scout horseman
marksman scavenger
is that so
id be of better use with regulars
whered you learn all that
riding shooting scavenging
my father taught me
teach you any humility
he tried it didnt take
he also taught you every trail
between here and charles town
which is why he transferred you
well put the word out
start on the south side of
well cover more ground
if we split up
very well corporal you take
harrisville pembroke wakefield
ill start on the north side
meet at the mission in black swamp
corporal
be careful
yes sir
you have children
french
it skirts the mountain and then
extends down towards
the headwater here
and right across to the far bank
of the ohio river
its 100000 acres
its an imposing land grant my lord
you will be a country unto yourself
his majesty is most generous
though your service in this war
more than warrants such a gift
yes this is how his majesty
rewards those
who fight for him as gentlemen
i dare to presume my own meager
contributions will be rewarded one day
you may presume too much
his majesty like history
judges us by the outcome of the war
and the manner in which
it was fought
we serve the crown and we must
conduct ourselves accordingly
surrendering troops
will be given quarter
these brutal tactics must stop
is it not enough that i have
never lost a battle
you serve me
and the manner in which
you serve me reflects upon me
i wouldve thought that a gentleman
from a family as esteemed as yours
would understand that
my late father squandered any esteem
in which we were held
along with my inheritance
i advance myself
only through victory
you advance yourself
only through my good graces
these colonials are our brethren
and when this conflict is over we
will reestablish commerce with them
do you understand colonel
perfectly my lord
reverend with your permission
id like to make an announcement
young man this is a house of god
i understand that reverend
i apologize
the south carolina militia is
being called up
im here to enlist every man willing
son
we are here to pray
for the souls of those men
hanging outside
yes pray for them
but honor them by
taking up arms with us
and bring more suffering
to this town
if king george can hang those men
he can hang any one of us
dan scott
barely a week ago you railed
for two hours about independence
mr hardwick how many times
have i heard you
speak of freedom
at my fathers table
half the men in this church
including you father
and you reverend
are as ardent patriots as i
will you now when you are needed
most stop at only words
is that the sort of men you are
i ask only that you act
upon the beliefs
of which you have
so strongly spoken
and in which you
so strongly believe
whos with us
mr howard
sir
may i have permission to
write to anne
may i have permission to write anne
yes
you have permission
to write me
oh write her
very well
thank you sir
reverend
a shepherd must tend his flock
and at times fight off the wolves
are you sure this is the right place
to recruit for a militia
god save king george
i think we came to the right place
any bounty
no scalp money this time rollins
but you can keep or sell me the muskets
and gear of any redcoat you kill
they hanged my brother
down in acworth
every damned one of them redcoats
deserves to die
sign up
with all my ailments
i wouldnt make it through
the first skirmish no sir
but you can have my negro
hell fight in my stead
occam get over here
aint overly smart
hes strong as a bull
can you write
no no sir
well then make your mark
why
i just signed him over to you
if youre willing make your mark
thatll do
ill kill me some redcoats
i believe you would
how old are you
not quite old enough
but his time will come
john billings
i was hoping youd turn up
theres a story going around
about 20 redcoats
got killed by a ghost
or some damn thing
carried a cherokee tomahawk
arent you a little old to be
believing in ghost stories
how many did you get
twelve
good
these men
theyre not the sort we need
theyre exactly the sort we need
theyve fought
this kind of war before
what about me
am i one of that sort
hell no
your sort gives that sort a bad name
i want accuracy and precision
make ready
take aim
fire
dear anne
our force continues to grow
as long as we continue to fight
others will come to fight beside us
i long to see you and speak to you
im hopeful that our duties
will bring me near you
until then i am and will remain
most affectionately yours
gabriel
we surrender
no god stop
for the love of god we
these men were about to surrender
perhaps
we will never know
this is murder
hell reverend theyre redcoats
theyve earned it
were better than that
what do you know about war
i know the difference
between fighting
go back to church
quiet
hes right
quarter will be given to british
wounded and any who surrender
they gave no quarter when they fired on
a ship carrying my wife and daughters
i watched from 200 yards off
as they were burned alive
all my sympathy but my order stands
damn your sympathy
who are you to give such an order
i know what you did
to my countrymen at fort wilderness
were militia
this is not regular army
every man here is free to
come and go as he pleases
but while youre here
you will obey my command
or i will have you shot
damn dogs
shoot the damn things
stay that pistol
they wont let you near the wagon
rum madeira
no wonder they were guarding it
officers uniforms
what you think all this is worth
its the personal correspondence
of lord cornwallis
this is his journal
i say we drink the wine eat the dogs
and use the papers for musket wadding
eat the dogs
dog is a fine meal
good heavens
i have some maps here for you
put them down over there
thank you
here a proper musket for you
i dont know about you but i dont like
the idea giving muskets to slaves
your sense of freedom is
as pale as your skin
dont listen to them
if we win this war
a lot of things will change
what will change
they call this the new world
its not its the same as the old
but well have a chance
to build a new world
a world where all men are
created equal under god
equal
sounds good
ive just been in the mind
of a genius
cornwallis knows more about warfare
than we could learn in a dozen lifetimes
thats cheerful news
his victories at camden and
charles town were perfect perfect
and he knows it whats more
perhaps thats his weakness
sir
pride
prides a weakness
personally i would prefer stupidity
pride will do
finished my lord
ive taken it in at the back
added wider epaulets
and looped gold braiding
its a horse blanket
i dont know my lord
its really quite nice
very nice my lord
very well its a nice horse blanket
colonel tavington
why after six weeks
am i still attending a ball
in south carolina
when i should be attending balls
in north carolina
first the theft of my baggage
including my memoirs
on which i spent countless hours
then half the bridges and ferries
between here and charles town burned
if you cant protect our supply lines
against militia
how do you intend doing so against
the regulars or the french
they wont fight like regulars
we cant find them
colonel theyre militia
theyre farmers with pitchforks
theyre rather more than that
im afraid
made so by their commander
this ghost
oh ghost ghost ghost
you created this ghost colonel
your brutality swelled his ranks
without them this ghost
wouldve disappeared
and id be
in north carolina by now
in my defense my lord
oh enough enough
a fine soldier you are
bested by a bedtime story
give me the horse blanket
ohara our supply ship appears
to have arrived
yes my lord it has
then why am i still wearing this rag
your replacement wardrobe is
aboard ship but
colonel tavington thought it best to
secure our arms and munitions first
they are being unloaded
you look good in that color
it stinks
well its had a dead man in it
the beasts took your dogs too
yes
fine animals
a gift from his majesty
dead now for all i know
is there no decency
oh fireworks lovely
mr howard
ive come to call on anne
ive come to call on anne
well of course you
call yourself a man
father stop it you heard him

bundling bags are a wonderful
tradition i dont mind in the least

its very good
im pleased that you like it
peter
dont worry i sew better
than my mother did
i hope so
if youre just gonna stand there
why dont you read it for us
i cant read
i can
take notice
by order of general washington
and the continental congress
all bound slaves who give
minimum one year service
in the continental army
will be granted freedom
and be paid a bounty of five
shillings for each month of service
did you hear that
first theyll free them
then theyll pay them
only another six months
what will you do with freedom
i made this for you
look after your mother
you know peter
i cant pay you for this
benjamin you pay me what you can
when you can
im obliged
gabriel sure reminds me a lot of you
no no hes more like his mother
corporal
take your time dogs
sir
this road is closed
these wagons now belong to
the continental army
ready arms
by twos
theres no need for your men to die
leave the wagons and go
this is the kings highway
and i advise you and your men
to make way
charge
fire
retreat
save yourselves
retreat
ambush ambush
i have the count
22 are dead
18 wounded and 20 are missing
im through
he wont be the last to leave
trust me
soon my countrymen will arrive
the french army is
to hell with you
and to hell with the french army
we dont need them
we got benjamin martin
we know what he done to the french
father
men always buy you drinks because
of what happened at fort wilderness
strangers know more
about you than i do
tell me what happened
your mother asked me that question
around about the time you were born
i was drunk and foolish enough
to answer it
the french and the cherokee
had raided along the blue ridge
the english settlers had sought refuge
at fort charles
by the time we got there
the fort was abandoned
theyd left about a week before
but what we found was
go on
theyd killed all the settlers
the men
with the women and
some of the children they had
we buried them all
what was left of them
we caught up with them
at fort wilderness
we took our time
we cut them apart slowly
piece by piece
i can see their faces
i can still hear their screams
all but two we let them live
we sent the heads on a pallet
with the two that lived
back to fort ambercon
the eyes tongues fingers
we put in baskets
sent them down the asheulot
to the cherokee
soon after the cherokee broke
their treaty with the french
thats how we justified it
we were
heroes
and men bought you drinks
not a day goes by where i dont ask
gods forgiveness for what i did
thomas was my brother
as well as your son
you may not believe this but i want
satisfaction as much as you do
but not at the expense of our cause
there will be a time for revenge
but until then stay the course
your mother said that when
id get drunk or lose my temper
shed say it to me
when i picked on thomas
i miss him
the british got 18 of our men
at fort carolina
theyll be hung one at a time until
they give up the rest of us
reverend
can you write a letter for me
to my wife and boy
yes of course i will
but first let us pray
my lord
there is a rider at the gates
a civilian carrying a white flag
i am occupied
he has a pair of dogs with him
great danes
and dear lord
protect us in this
our hour of need
this we ask in the name
of the father the son
and the holy ghost
wait here
general lord cornwallis will be
with you shortly
jupiter mars come boys
come
my good boys my brave boys
you seem to be well fed
i thank you for that
im afraid i dont know your name
im a colonel in the continental army
my rank should be sufficient for now
as you wish
please be seated
thank you
would you as the initiating officer
care to begin
i will unless youd like to
claim aggrieved status
yes i would like to claim
aggrieved status
very well sir proceed
you have in your possession
belongings of mine including clothing
furniture personal effects
of a nonmilitary nature
which id like returned to me
indeed i will do so
as soon as possible
thank you
now we come to the matter
of the specific targeting
of officers during engagements
you must know that in civilized
warfare officers in the field
must not be accorded inappropriate
levels of hostile attention
to your mind what are appropriate
levels of hostile attention
imagine the chaos that would follow
from leaderless armies
having at each other
there must be gentlemen in command
to lead
and where necessary
restrain their men
restrain them from say targeting
civilians women children and such
thats a separate issue
no i consider them linked
and as long as your soldiers
attack civilians
i will order the shooting
of officers at every engagement
and my men are excellent marksmen
very well
now let us move on to
prisoner exchange
sir
you have 18 of my men
i want them back
i do have 18 criminals
under sentence of death
but i hold no prisoners of war
if thats your position
18 of your officers will have to die
nineteen if you hang me
with my men
my officers
sir
top of the ridge to your left
below the tree line
their names and ranks
they refused to give names there are
9 lieutenants 5 captains 3 majors
and one fat colonel
who called me
a cheeky fellow
this is not the conduct
of a gentleman
if the conduct of your officers is
the measure of a gentleman
ill take that as a compliment
get my men
arrange the exchange
my lord
thank you sir
release the prisoners
what is this
prisoner exchange
he has 18 of our officers
who is he i recognize him
hes the commander of the militia
your ghost
stay that sword colonel
he rode in under a white flag
for formal parley
this is madness
if you harm him
you condemn our officers
with respect sir hes killed as many
officers in the last two months
he has shown no aggression here
hence he cannot be touched
has he not
you
so youre the ghost are you
i remember you
on that farm that stupid little boy
did he die
you know
its an ugly business
doing ones duty
but just occasionally
its a real pleasure
before this war is over
im going to kill you
why wait
soon
move out
but i still think its imperative
to push north
one of our captured officers my lord
my reputation suffers
because of your incompetence
that man insults me
quite impressive for a farmer with
a pitchfork wouldnt you say
i want you to find that man
i want you to capture him
the man has
the loyalty of the people
they protect him protect his family
protect the families of his men
i can capture him for you
but to do so requires the use
of tactics that are somewhat
what was the word
your lordship used
brutal i think
go on
i am prepared to do
what is necessary
i alone will assume the full mantle
of responsibility for my actions
free of the chain of command
rendering you blameless
however
if i do this
you and i both know that i can
never return to england with honor
what i wonder is to become of me
when this war is over here
in the colonies
the new aristocracy
will be landowners
tell me about ohio
make way
as you were
wilkins a plantation seven miles
from wakefield on the santee
east of black swamp
who lived there
benjamin martin

my wife in alexandria is with child
my first
i fight for that child
benjamin nothing will replace
your sons
but if you come with us
you can justify their sacrifice
why
why do men feel
they can justify death
is it arrogance or
i have long feared
that my sins would return
to visit me
and the cost is more than i can bear
benjamin we have a chance
greene and dan morgan are
down from virginia
if we win this next battle victory
in the war is within our grasp
go then
seek your victory
im small issue to it
youre wrong benjamin
you matter to your men
and to others as well
your victories
and your losses
are shared by more than you know
stay with us
stay the course
i have run my course
you men will be leaving with us
prepare the baggage
jean
you will be missed tomorrow colonel
missed my lord
your wound
its nothing my lord
i am as ever ready to serve
very well
make sure you do
i stand on the eve of the greatest
victory of my career dont fail me
my efforts in no small measure
have brought you here
i grant you that small measure
in spite of your failure
to deliver the ghost to me
thus far
i will not tolerate
a premature charge
born of your eagerness for glory
wait for my order
or you may abandon
any hope of ohio
tomorrows battle can alter
the course of the war
general greene what exactly is
the task before us
gentlemen
cornwallis has us cornered
not only does he outnumber us
but nearly half of our force
is militia
unreliable at best
excuse me sir
you underestimate our militia
all of you do
weve seen our militia lines break
time and again
kips bay princeton
but the british have seen that too
cornwallis own letters bear out that
he has no respect for the militia
what are you suggesting ben
im suggesting we use that
i know you men have sacrificed
a lot so far
but all im asking is that you
let the front line of the militia
fire two shots tomorrow
a lot can happen in the time it takes
to fire two shots
especially against british regulars
indeed thats why im not asking you
to fire three
if i die i will die well dressed
fire
battalion
company halt
harry
will you give this to my children

you dream general
kill me before the war is over
will you
it appears you are not
the better man
youre right
my sons were better men
sound the retreat
sound
retreat
dear charlotte
the war has turned
general cornwallis took flight
with his army and moved north
we continued to engage the british
and in the following months
cornwallis entrenched himself
at yorktown virginia
washington escaped from the north
and surrounded cornwallis
who could not retreat to the seas
it was blocked off by
our longlost friends
who had finally arrived
vive la france
vive la liberté
my lord i beseech you
you must order the surrender
how could it come to this
an army of rabble
peasants
everything will change
everything has changed
though he eventually surrendered
cornwallis himself hid in shame
appointing his subordinate to
relinquish his sword
with the war ending
and our militia disbanding
i take measure of what
we have lost
and what we have won
my hope and prayer is that
the sacrifices borne by so many
will spawn and fulfill the promise
of our new nation
tell the children and especially
susan that i will keep my promise
as i will be returning
to you all soon
where will you go now
home start over
your wifes expecting a child
isnt she
she gave birth to a son
three weeks ago
whatd you name him
we named him gabriel
thank you harry
gabriel is a good name for a farmer
it is it is
jean
ben
gabriel said if we won the war
we could build a whole new world
just figured wed get started
