and she ll always be
looking down on us 
and protect us  forever 
come  into bed 
good night  good night  meg 
it helps her to know mother s there 
good night 
so what was in the mail 
 the new york and
pennsylvania assemblies   
   are debating independence   
what about the middle colonies 
 in chestertown 
they burned the customs house   
   and tar and feathered
two magistrates 
they died of    they died of burns   
damn fools 
who  the writers or the magistrates 
what does it say about
the continental congress 
it says here they ll make
a declaration of independence by july 
peter cuppin joined the continentals 
he s 17  a year younger than i 
well  the assembly s been convened 
so i ve been called to charles town 
  we re going to charles town 
  we are 
we leave in the morning 
charlotte 
the children are here 
thank you 
aunt charlotte 
margaret  william  look at you 
missed you 
they re huge 
what have you been feeding them 
well  they re from good stock 
on their mother s side  of course 
thank you  come inside 
wait until you see what i have 
  presents  presents for us 
  move slowly 
keep an eye on these heathens 
will you 
sorry 
i have this for you  susan 
it belonged to your mother 
she s still not talking 
no 
it does me good to see you 
look  there s gabriel 
gabriel 
hang king george 
harry burwell is here recruiting 
the governor has vowed if the
assembly votes a single shilling   
   to the continental army 
he ll dissolve the body 
wouldn t that force our delegates in
philadelphia to vote for independence 
yes 
send us off to war alongside
massachusetts 
get king george 
  hang them all 
  hang the lot of them 
that s enough 
very well  children  inside 
come along now  inside now 
burwell will be counting on your vote 
and he ll expect you
to be the first to enlist 
yes  i imagine so 
i m sorry  the heathens are   
they have long needed
a woman in their lives 
a mother 
especially susan 
my name is peter howard 
i lost most of my hearing
and my left leg   
   fighting for the crown
in the french and indian war 
and how did king george reward me 
he cuts off my other leg
with his taxes 
miss howard  isn t it 
you know who i am  gabriel martin 
the last time you saw me 
i was 11 and you put ink in my tea 
i believe that was one of my younger
brothers  perhaps samuel or nathan 
it was you  and it turned
my teeth black for a month 
  and send a message to king george
he will never forget 
our first order of business   
and our last  if we vote a levy 
order  order 
mr  simms  you do not have the floor 
first  an address by colonel
harry burwell of the continental army 
colonel burwell 
you all know why i m here 
i m not an orator 
and i would not try to convince you
of the worthiness of our cause 
i m a soldier 
and we are at war 
from philadelphia  we expect
a declaration of independence 
8 of the 13 colonies have
levied money   
   in support of a continental army 
i ask that south carolina be the ninth 
massachusetts and virginia
may be at war   
   but south carolina is not 
hear  hear 
this is not a war for the independence
of one or two colonies   
   but for the independence
of one nation 
and what nation is that 
an american nation 
there is no such nation
and to speak of one is treason 
we are citizens
of an american nation 
and our rights are being threatened   
   by a tyrant 3000 miles away 
would you tell me  please 
mr  howard   
   why should i trade one tyrant
3000 miles away   
   for 3000 tyrants one mile away 
an elected legislature can trample
a man s rights as easily as a king can 
captain martin   
   i understood you to be a patriot 
if you mean by  patriot   am i angry
about taxation without representation 
well  yes  i am 
should the american colonies govern
themselves independently 
i believe they can  and they should 
but if you re asking me am i willing
to go to war with england   
   then the answer is
most definitely no 
this from the same captain benjamin
martin whose fury was so famous   
   during the wilderness campaign 
i was intemperate in my youth 
temperance can be
a disguise for fear 
mr  middleton  i fought
with captain martin   
   under washington
in the french and indian war 
there s not a man in this room   
   or anywhere for that matter  to whom
i would more willingly trust my life 
there are alternatives to war 
we take our case before the king 
  we plead with him 
  we tried 
well  then  we try again and again
if necessary to avoid a war 
i was at bunker hill 
the british advanced three times 
we killed 700 at point blank range
and still they took the ground 
that is the measure of their resolve 
if your principles dictate
independence   
   then war is the only way 
it is come to that 
hear  hear 
i have seven children 
my wife is dead 
now  who s to care for them
if i go to war 
wars are not fought
only by childless men 
granted 
but mark my words 
this war will be fought 
not on the frontier   
   or on some distant battlefield   
   but amongst us 
among our homes 
our children will learn of it
with their own eyes 
and the innocent will die
with the rest of us 
i will not fight 
and because i will not fight 
i will not cast a vote   
   that will send others to fight
in my stead 
and your principles 
i m a parent  i haven t got
the luxury of principles 
we must vote to levy 
28 to 12  the levy passed 
you intend to enlist
without my permission 
yes  i do 
father  i thought you were
a man of principle 
when you have a family of your own 
perhaps you ll understand 
when i have a family of my own 
i won t hide behind them 
he s as imprudent as his father was
at his age 
regrettably so 
i ll see to it that he
serves under me 
make him a clerk or quartermaster 
something of that sort 
good luck 
dear thomas 
though many seasons have passed   
   it seems like only yesterday when we
last saw each other in charles town 
with sadness  i learned
of its recent fall to the british   
   under general cornwallis 
i received a letter
from aunt charlotte   
   saying she closed her home
in charles town after the city fell   
   and moved to her plantation
on the santee 
here in the north  our campaign has
been marked by defeat and privation 
our losses have been grievous 
my good friend  peter cuppin 
fell at elizabethtown 
his death has been difficult to bear 
we will march south
with general gates   
   to fight the redcoats
under cornwallis 
thank you  sir 
i envy you   
   your youth and distance from this
cruel conflict of which i am a part 
 but i am fortunate to be
serving the cause of liberty 
and though i fear death   
   each day in prayer i reaffirm
my willingness   
   to give my life in its service 
pray for me 
but above all  pray for the cause 
your loving brother  gabriel

who fight for the crown   
   will be granted their freedom
with our victory

he cannot be held as a spy 
well  we won t hold him 
we re going to hang him 
  colonel   
  father 
oh  i see  he s your son 
perhaps you should ve taught him
something of loyalty 
colonel  i beg you  please reconsider 
by the rules of war   
would you like a lesson  sir 
in the rules of war 
or perhaps your children would 
no lesson is necessary

colonel william tavington 
green dragoons 
what happened  who did this 
him 
it was mad 
i couldn t tell you who it was 
calm down  calm down  man 
twenty of his majesty s soldiers
are dead 
and i need to know how 
  he said there was   
  were you there 
then let him speak 
take your time and tell me 
how many were there 
were they militia 
were they regulars 
i don t really remember how many 
maybe one 
one man  really 
he was in the flank 
all around us 
amongst us 
i could barely see him 
he was there  then he was gone 
he just vanished 
sounds more like a ghost than a man 
a ghost 
he was like a ghost 
enough 
bordon  take a patrol 
capture this ghost before
word of his exploits spread 
  who s this 
  sir  this is captain wilkins 
he was with the loyalist colonial
militia  he might be of use 
another colonial 
captain wilkins 
where do your loyalties lie 
to king and country 
why should i trust a man who d
betray his neighbors 
those neighbors of mine who stand
against england   
   deserve to die a traitor s death 
we ll see 
mr  martin 
miss charlotte 
you re safe now  try to sleep 
good night 
good night 
father 
yes

you did what i told you to do 
you did what you had to 
there was no wrong in it 
i m glad i killed them 
i m glad 
get some rest 
samuel 
you ve done nothing for which
you should be ashamed 
i ve done nothing 
and for that  i am ashamed 
we ll go to saint helena 
that s a free slave island
just north of charles town 
right under the british noses 
  they won t think of look   
  i m joining up with them 
gabriel

i m going back 
i m a soldier  it s my duty 
your duty is to your family

   goodbye 
thank you 
halt 
make ready 
take aim 
fire 
i m not going back 
no  i didn t expect you would 
that gates is a damn fool 
he spent too many years
in the british army 
going muzzle to muzzle with redcoats
in open field  it s madness 
halt 
make ready 
present 
fire 
this battle was over before it began 
retreat 
retreat 
these rustics are so inept 
nearly takes the honor
out of victory 
nearly 
hello general  gentlemen 
a glorious day
for his majesty and england 
colonel tavington 
always too early 
always too eager for glory 
for victory  my lord 
i believe we took the field 
next time  you ll wait
for my command 
it appears that colonel tavington
prefers to follow his own commands 
general o hara tells me   
   you ve earned the nickname
 the butcher  among the populous 
we ll discuss it tomorrow 
gentlemen  my compliments 
  to a victory 
  hear  hear 
hold him firm 
  where s your commanding officer 
  that tent there 
it s a lost cause 
benjamin martin 
i m in no mood for a lecture 
where s your general gates now 
the last anyone saw 
riding hard northeast   
   his staff 100 yards behind 
trying to catch up 
so who s in command 
i am 
i think 
what are my orders 
we re a breath away from losing
this war  benjamin 
in the north  washington is
reeling from morristown 
he s running and hiding
from 12 000 redcoats 
in the south  cornwallis has
broken our back 
captured over 5000 of our troops
when he took charles town 
and he destroyed the only army
between him and new york 
nothing will stop him from
heading north to finish off washington 
unless we can keep cornwallis
in the south till the french arrive 
they ve promised a fleet
and 10 000 troops 
when 
six months at the earliest 
you trust the french
to keep their word 
absolument 
benjamin martin 
major jean villeneuve 
french seventh light foot 
he will help train the militia 
the hero of fort wilderness 
your reputation precedes you 
you really expect to hold cornwallis
here using just militia 
not me  you 
they re not soldiers  they re farmers 
they d be better off letting
the british march through 
they d be better off 
but the cause wouldn t 
how many men
does cornwallis have 
8000 infantry 
around 600 cavalry 
i m giving you a field commission
as a colonel 
might i request that you transfer
my son under my command 
sir  no  i   
that s done 
thank you 
colonel  i ve been a soldier
for two years 
as a scout  horseman 
marksman  scavenger 
  is that so 
  i d be of better use with regulars 
where d you learn all that
riding  shooting  scavenging 
my father taught me 
teach you any humility 
he tried  it didn t take 
he also taught you every trail
between here and charles town   
   which is why he transferred you 
we ll put the word out 
start on the south side of   
we ll cover more ground
if we split up 
very well  corporal  you take
harrisville  pembroke  wakefield 
i ll start on the north side 
meet at the mission in black swamp 
corporal 
be careful 
yes  sir 
you have children 
french 
it skirts the mountain and then   
   extends down towards
the headwater here   
   and right across to the far bank
of the ohio river 
it s 100 000 acres 
it s an imposing land grant  my lord 
you will be a country unto yourself 
his majesty is most generous 
though your service in this war
more than warrants such a gift 
yes  this is how his majesty
rewards those   
   who fight for him as gentlemen 
i dare to presume my own meager
contributions will be rewarded one day 
you may presume too much 
his majesty  like history 
judges us by the outcome of the war   
   and the manner in which
it was fought 
we serve the crown  and we must
conduct ourselves accordingly 
surrendering troops
will be given quarter 
these brutal tactics must stop 
is it not enough that i have
never lost a battle 
you serve me   
   and the manner in which
you serve me reflects upon me 
i would ve thought that a gentleman
from a family as esteemed as yours   
   would understand that 
my late father squandered any esteem
in which we were held   
   along with my inheritance 
i advance myself
only through victory 
you advance yourself
only through my good graces 
these colonials are our brethren 
and when this conflict is over  we
will re establish commerce with them 
do you understand  colonel 
perfectly  my lord 
reverend  with your permission 
i d like to make an announcement 
young man  this is a house of god 
i understand that  reverend 
i apologize 
the south carolina militia is
being called up 
i m here to enlist every man willing 
son   
   we are here to pray   
   for the souls of those men
hanging outside 
yes  pray for them 
but honor them by
taking up arms with us 
and bring more suffering
to this town 
if king george can hang those men 
he can hang any one of us 
dan scott   
   barely a week ago you railed
for two hours about independence 
mr  hardwick  how many times
have i heard you   
   speak of freedom
at my father s table 
half the men in this church 
including you  father   
   and you  reverend   
   are as ardent patriots as i 
will you now  when you are needed
most  stop at only words 
is that the sort of men you are 
i ask only that you act
upon the beliefs   
   of which you have
so strongly spoken   
   and in which you
so strongly believe 
who s with us 
mr  howard 
sir   
   may i have permission to
write to anne 
  may i have permission to write anne 
  yes 
you have permission   
   to write me 
oh  write her 
very well 
thank you  sir 
reverend 
a shepherd must tend his flock 
and  at times  fight off the wolves 
are you sure this is the right place
to recruit for a militia 
god save king george 
i think we came to the right place 
  any bounty 
  no scalp money this time  rollins 
but you can keep or sell me the muskets
and gear of any redcoat you kill 
they hanged my brother
down in acworth 
every damned one of them redcoats
deserves to die 
  sign up 
  with all my ailments   
   i wouldn t make it through
the first skirmish  no  sir 
but you can have my negro 
he ll fight in my stead 
occam  get over here 
ain t overly smart 
he s strong as a bull 
can you write 
no  no  sir 
  well  then  make your mark 
  why 
i just signed him over to you 
if you re willing  make your mark 
that ll do 
i ll kill me some redcoats 
i believe you would 
how old are you 
not quite old enough 
but his time will come 
john billings 
i was hoping you d turn up 
there s a story going around
about 20 redcoats   
   got killed by a ghost
or some damn thing 
carried a cherokee tomahawk 
aren t you a little old to be
believing in ghost stories 
how many did you get 
twelve 
good 
these men 
they re not the sort we need 
they re exactly the sort we need 
they ve fought
this kind of war before 
what about me 
am i one of that sort 
hell  no 
your sort gives that sort a bad name 
i want accuracy and precision 
make ready 
take aim 
fire 
dear anne 
our force continues to grow 
as long as we continue to fight 
others will come to fight beside us 
i long to see you and speak to you 
i m hopeful that our duties
will bring me near you 
until then  i am and will remain
most affectionately yours 
gabriel 
we surrender 
no  god  stop 
for the love of god  we   
these men were about to surrender 
perhaps 
we will never know 
this is murder 
hell  reverend  they re redcoats 
they ve earned it 
  we re better than that 
  what do you know about war 
i know the difference
between fighting   
go back to church 
quiet 
he s right 
quarter will be given to british
wounded and any who surrender 
they gave no quarter when they fired on
a ship carrying my wife and daughters 
i watched from 200 yards off
as they were burned alive 
  all my sympathy  but my order stands 
  damn your sympathy 
who are you to give such an order 
i know what you did
to my countrymen at fort wilderness 
we re militia 
this is not regular army 
every man here is free to
come and go as he pleases 
but while you re here   
   you will obey my command
or i will have you shot 
  damn dogs 
  shoot the damn things 
  stay that pistol 
  they won t let you near the wagon 
  rum  madeira 
  no wonder they were guarding it 
officers  uniforms 
what you think all this is worth 
it s the personal correspondence
of lord cornwallis 
this is his journal 
i say we drink the wine  eat the dogs
and use the papers for musket wadding 
eat the dogs 
dog is a fine meal 
good heavens 
i have some maps here for you 
put them down over there 
thank you 
here  a proper musket for you 
i don t know about you  but i don t like
the idea giving muskets to slaves 
your sense of freedom is
as pale as your skin 
don t listen to them 
if we win this war 
a lot of things will change 
what will change 
they call this the new world 
it s not  it s the same as the old 
but we ll have a chance
to build a new world 
a world where all men are
created equal under god 
equal 
sounds good 
i ve just been in the mind
of a genius 
cornwallis knows more about warfare
than we could learn in a dozen lifetimes 
that s cheerful news 
his victories at camden and
charles town were perfect  perfect 
and he knows it  what s more 
perhaps that s his weakness 
sir 
pride 
pride s a weakness 
personally  i would prefer stupidity 
pride will do 
finished  my lord 
i ve taken it in at the back   
   added wider epaulets
and looped gold braiding 
  it s a horse blanket 
  i don t know  my lord 
it s really quite nice 
  very nice  my lord 
  very well  it s a nice horse blanket 
colonel tavington 
why  after six weeks   
   am i still attending a ball
in south carolina   
   when i should be attending balls
in north carolina 
first  the theft of my baggage   
   including my memoirs 
on which i spent countless hours 
then half the bridges and ferries
between here and charles town burned 
if you can t protect our supply lines
against militia   
   how do you intend doing so against
the regulars or the french 
they won t fight like regulars 
we can t find them 
colonel  they re militia 
they re farmers with pitchforks 
they re rather more than that 
i m afraid 
made so by their commander 
this ghost 
oh  ghost  ghost  ghost 
you created this ghost  colonel 
your brutality swelled his ranks 
without them this ghost
would ve disappeared   
   and i d be
in north carolina by now 
in my defense  my lord   
oh  enough  enough 
a fine soldier you are 
bested by a bedtime story 
give me the horse blanket 
o hara  our supply ship appears
to have arrived 
yes  my lord  it has 
then why am i still wearing this rag 
your replacement wardrobe is
aboard ship  but   
   colonel tavington thought it best to
secure our arms and munitions first 
they are being unloaded

peter 
don t worry  i sew better
than my mother did 
i hope so 
if you re just gonna stand there   
   why don t you read it for us 
i can t read 
i can 
 take notice 
by order of general washington
and the continental congress   
   all bound slaves who give
minimum one year service   
   in the continental army   
   will be granted freedom   
   and be paid a bounty of five
shillings for each month of service   
did you hear that 
first they ll free them 
then they ll pay them 
only another six months 
what will you do with freedom 
i made this for you 
look after your mother 
you know  peter   
   i can t pay you for this 
benjamin  you pay me what you can 
when you can 
i m obliged 
gabriel sure reminds me a lot of you 
no  no  he s more like his mother 
corporal 
take your time  dogs 
sir 
this road is closed 
these wagons now belong to
the continental army 
ready arms 
by twos 
there s no need for your men to die 
leave the wagons and go 
this is the king s highway 
and i advise you and your men
to make way 
charge 
fire 
retreat 
save yourselves 
retreat 
ambush  ambush 
i have the count 
22 are dead 
18 wounded and 20 are missing 
i m through 
he won t be the last to leave 
trust me 
soon my countrymen will arrive 
  the french army is   
  to hell with you 
and to hell with the french army 
we don t need them 
we got benjamin martin 
we know what he done to the french 
father 
men always buy you drinks because
of what happened at fort wilderness 
strangers know more
about you than i do 
tell me what happened 
your mother asked me that question
around about the time you were born 
i was drunk and foolish enough
to answer it 
the french and the cherokee
had raided along the blue ridge 
the english settlers had sought refuge
at fort charles 
by the time we got there 
the fort was abandoned 
they d left about a week before 
but what we found was   
go on 
they d killed all the settlers 
the men 
with the women and   
   some of the children  they had   
we buried them all 
what was left of them 
we caught up with them
at fort wilderness 
we took our time 
we cut them apart slowly 
piece by piece 
i can see their faces 
i can still hear their screams 
all but two  we let them live 
we sent the heads on a pallet   
   with the two that lived
back to fort ambercon 
the eyes  tongues  fingers   
   we put in baskets 
sent them down the asheulot
to the cherokee 
soon after  the cherokee broke
their treaty with the french 
that s how we justified it 
we were   
   heroes 
and men bought you drinks 
not a day goes by where i don t ask
god s forgiveness for what i did 
thomas was my brother 
as well as your son 
you may not believe this  but i want
satisfaction as much as you do 
but not at the expense of our cause 
there will be a time for revenge 
but until then  stay the course 
your mother said that when
i d get drunk or lose my temper 
she d say it to me
when i picked on thomas 
i miss him 
the british got 18 of our men
at fort carolina 
they ll be hung one at a time until
they give up the rest of us 
reverend   
   can you write a letter for me 
  to my wife and boy 
  yes  of course i will 
but first let us pray 
my lord   
   there is a rider at the gates 
a civilian carrying a white flag 
i am occupied 
he has a pair of dogs with him 
great danes 
and dear lord   
   protect us in this 
our hour of need 
this we ask in the name
of the father  the son   
and the holy ghost 
wait here 
general lord cornwallis will be
with you shortly 
jupiter  mars  come  boys 
come 
my good boys  my brave boys 
you seem to be well fed 
i thank you for that 
i m afraid i don t know your name 
i m a colonel in the continental army 
my rank should be sufficient for now 
as you wish 
please be seated 
thank you 
would you  as the initiating officer 
care to begin 
i will  unless you d like to
claim aggrieved status 
yes  i would like to claim
aggrieved status 
very well  sir  proceed 
you have in your possession
belongings of mine including clothing   
   furniture  personal effects
of a non military nature   
   which i d like returned to me 
indeed  i will do so
as soon as possible 
thank you 
now we come to the matter
of the specific targeting   
   of officers during engagements 
you must know that in civilized
warfare  officers in the field   
   must not be accorded inappropriate
levels of hostile attention 
to your mind  what are appropriate
levels of hostile attention 
imagine the chaos that would follow   
   from leaderless armies
having at each other 
there must be gentlemen in command
to lead   
   and  where necessary 
restrain their men 
restrain them from  say  targeting
civilians  women  children and such 
that s a separate issue 
no  i consider them linked 
and as long as your soldiers
attack civilians   
   i will order the shooting
of officers at every engagement 
and my men are excellent marksmen 
very well 
  now  let us move on to   
  prisoner exchange 
sir 
you have 18 of my men 
i want them back 
i do have 18 criminals
under sentence of death   
   but i hold no prisoners of war 
if that s your position 
18 of your officers will have to die 
nineteen  if you hang me
with my men 
my officers 
sir 
top of the ridge  to your left 
below the tree line 
their names and ranks 
they refused to give names  there are
9 lieutenants  5 captains  3 majors   
   and one fat colonel
who called me   
   a cheeky fellow 
this is not the conduct
of a gentleman 
if the conduct of your officers is
the measure of a gentleman   
   i ll take that as a compliment 
get my men 
  arrange the exchange 
  my lord 
thank you  sir 
release the prisoners 
  what is this 
  prisoner exchange 
he has 18 of our officers 
who is he  i recognize him 
he s the commander of the militia 
  your ghost 
  stay that sword  colonel 
he rode in under a white flag
for formal parley 
this is madness 
if you harm him 
you condemn our officers 
with respect  sir  he s killed as many
officers in the last two months 
he has shown no aggression here 
hence he cannot be touched 
has he not 
you 
so you re the ghost  are you 
i remember you 
on that farm  that stupid little boy 
did he die 
you know   
   it s an ugly business 
doing one s duty 
but just occasionally   
   it s a real pleasure 
before this war is over 
i m going to kill you 
why wait 
soon 
move out 
but i still think it s imperative
to push north 
one of our captured officers  my lord 
my reputation suffers
because of your incompetence 
that man insults me 
quite impressive for a farmer with
a pitchfork  wouldn t you say 
i want you to find that man 
i want you to capture him 
the man has
the loyalty of the people 
they protect him  protect his family 
protect the families of his men 
i can capture him for you 
but to do so requires the use
of tactics that are somewhat   
what was the word
your lordship used 
 brutal   i think 
go on 
i am prepared to do
what is necessary 
i alone will assume the full mantle
of responsibility for my actions   
   free of the chain of command   
   rendering you blameless 
however   
   if i do this   
   you and i both know that i can
never return to england with honor 
what  i wonder  is to become of me 
when this war is over here
in the colonies   
   the new aristocracy   
   will be landowners 
tell me about ohio 
make way 
as you were 
wilkins  a plantation seven miles
from wakefield  on the santee

what did she say

   that she loves you
and misses you   
   but understands
why you can t be with her 
my lord  she said that 
isn t that something 
tavington has a list of our men 
he s burning our homes   
   killing whomever resists

on a man

i d understand

benjamin  nothing will replace
your sons 
but if you come with us 
you can justify their sacrifice 
why 
why do men feel
they can justify death 
is it arrogance or 
i have long feared   
   that my sins would return
to visit me 
and the cost is more than i can bear 
benjamin  we have a chance 
greene and dan morgan are
down from virginia 
if we win this next battle  victory
in the war is within our grasp

  i m small issue to it

   and your losses   
   are shared by more than you know 
stay with us

you men will be leaving with us

make sure you do 
i stand on the eve of the greatest
victory of my career  don t fail me 
my efforts in no small measure
have brought you here 
i grant you that small measure   
   in spite of your failure
to deliver the ghost to me 
thus far 
i will not tolerate
a premature charge   
   born of your eagerness for glory 
wait for my order 
or you may abandon
any hope of ohio 
tomorrow s battle can alter
the course of the war 
general greene  what exactly is
the task before us 
gentlemen 
cornwallis has us cornered 
not only does he outnumber us   
   but nearly half of our force
is militia 
unreliable  at best 
excuse me  sir 
you underestimate our militia 
all of you do 
we ve seen our militia lines break
time and again 
kips bay  princeton 
but the british have seen that too 
cornwallis  own letters bear out that
he has no respect for the militia 
what are you suggesting  ben 
i m suggesting we use that 
i know you men have sacrificed
a lot so far 
but all i m asking is that you   
   let the front line of the militia
fire two shots tomorrow 
a lot can happen in the time it takes
to fire two shots 
especially against british regulars 
indeed  that s why i m not asking you
to fire three 
if i die  i will die well dressed 
fire

you re right 
my sons were better men 
sound the retreat 
sound   
   retreat 
dear charlotte 
the war has turned 
general cornwallis took flight
with his army and moved north 
we continued to engage the british 
and in the following months   
   cornwallis entrenched himself
at yorktown  virginia 
washington escaped from the north   
   and surrounded cornwallis 
who could not retreat to the seas 
it was blocked off by
our long lost friends   
   who had finally arrived 
vive la france 
vive la liberté 
my lord  i beseech you 
you must order the surrender 
how could it come to this 
an army of rabble 
peasants 
everything will change 
everything has changed 
though he eventually surrendered   
   cornwallis himself hid in shame   
   appointing his subordinate to
relinquish his sword 
with the war ending 
and our militia disbanding   
   i take measure of what
we have lost   
   and what we have won 
my hope and prayer is that
the sacrifices borne by so many   
   will spawn and fulfill the promise
of our new nation 
tell the children  and especially
susan  that i will keep my promise   
   as i will be returning
to you all soon 
where will you go now 
home  start over 
your wife s expecting a child 
isn t she 
she gave birth to a son
three weeks ago 
what d you name him 
we named him gabriel 
thank you  harry 
gabriel is a good name for a farmer 
it is  it is 
jean 
ben 
gabriel said if we won the war   
   we could build a whole new world 
just figured we d get started
