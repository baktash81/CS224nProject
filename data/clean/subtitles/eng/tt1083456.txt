i m getting scared  hold my purse   
  two weeks  shawn  two weeks 
  i know 
two weeks out of the best
years of our lives 
two weeks we re never
gonna get back  like  ever 
i know 
so are you guys psyched
for cheer camp or what 
it s  like  all i think about 
know how martin luther king
had a dream  well  i do too 
to kick ass at cheer camp  and if
that makes me shallow  then fine 
  call me and dr  king shallow 
  that doesn t make you shallow 
that makes you real 
we have got to do better
than last year 
we could take a dump in our pants
and still do better than last year 
  i m just saying 
  but we re better this year 
and if we work hard 
i think we have a real shot 
i don t know 
there s 300 girls up there   
who want it just as much
as we do 
  and who are much better than us 
  three hundred girls 
who want it just as much as we do 
and are much better than us 
tell you what  man 
that d be the place to be 
instead of sweating our balls off
in the desert with coach shit shit 
  so let s go 
  what 
let s go to cheer camp 
be cheerleaders 
  cheerleaders 
  yes 
oh  my god 
are you coming out to me 
i m so proud of you  man 
and you know what 
i kind of always knew 
will you shut up  all right 
i m too straight to be gay 
i could suck knob
and still be straight 
i could have one in my mouth
and two in each hand   
      and still win a straight award 
  all right 
which is why i wanna go
to cheer camp  think 
three hundred hotties
we ve never been with before 
i wonder if they let guys
go to cheer camp 
name  name  give me a name 
  carly  she s the captain 
  hey  carly 
yeah  i know  it s the most beautiful
name you ve ever heard   
my eyes look like forever   
and you love every bone in my body 
especially yours 
no  but that s good 
mind if i use it 
no  no  no lines 
we wanted to wish you
luck at cheer camp 
sure  you do  i know your game 
no girl left unturned 
  what 
  how dare you 
no  we just see how hard
you ladies cheer out there   
and we really hope
that you do good 
yeah  do us proud  you know  beat
the skirts off those 300 other girls 
and guys  are there guys there 
do guys go 
  what about guys 
  it s a good question 
there s girls and guys that go 
i don t know if guys 
yes  the good teams are all co ed 
that s interesting  i just didn t
know that  i was just pondering 
carly  come here  we re working on
a new mount bianca came up with 
  yeah 
  coming 
i m gonna walk away backwards 
so you guys don t talk about my ass 
man  she s got nice lumps 
either one of us ever hit that 
i don t think so  i think
she respects herself too much 
right 
who wants to deal with that drama 
so  what do you think
about cheer camp 
  what do you mean  what do i think 
  let s go 
  we re not cheerleaders 
  we re athletes  we can do anything 
they don t just let anybody go 
you ve gotta be part of a squad 
let s join a squad 
how hard can this be 
a couple of flips  a pyramid 
 black sheep 
three hundred honeys
on our biscuits 
  what about football camp 
  screw football 
the only reason we started playing
was to pull chicks 
you can t honestly tell me you enjoy
running in blazing hot pads   
trying to catch a pass two seconds
before some 2000 pound mongoloid   
      crashes into your nutter butters 
  el paso  here we come 
not if it comes to us first 
oh  shit 
  i m on fire 
  mookie 
  water  water  water 
  i ll put you out 
i m a hero 
screw football  let s go cheer 
shawny shawn 
we need to convince
the squad they need us 
  not gonna be easy 
  that s why we go to poppy 
  i wish there was another way 
  there s not 
  but i wish there was 
  but there s not  we re here 
  i wish we weren t 
  but we are 
hi  sis 
why am i looking at you  speak 
poppy  you re getting so big now 
how old are you 
i m 60  can we get past
the small talk 
the only time you come to see me
is when you need something 
what  tug mags 
mike s hard lemonade 
  another ride to the clinic 
  poppy 
no  we wanna go to that
cheerleading camp you re going to 
since you re killing on the jv squad
and so advanced beyond your years   
we thought you d get us
up to speed 
hey  buddy 
you can piss on my face   
just don t tell me it s raining 
you guys have been through
every girl at your school   
and you re looking
for fresh muff 
some itchy itchy nah nah 
wall to wall carpet 
okay  seriously  how old are you 
tell you what  i ll teach you
some basic cheerleader moves 
high v s  low v s 
touchdown  baskets 
don t the guys just throw
the girls up and then catch them 
pretty much  but i ll let you practice
on me and tell you what they re called 
in exchange  i get shawn s room 
  no 
  done 
those are my terms 
  we ll take them 
  dude  i ve got my own bathroom 
dude  after cheer camp  you won t
even need your own bathroom 
what  what does that even mean 
poppy  you got yourself a deal 
teach us  we go see carly 
  wrong  gossip girl 
  what 
carly s not one of your humpety hump
football groupies 
she s too smart to buy that you guys
wanna be cheerleaders 
okay  so  what s the play 
  here she comes  here she comes 
  go  go  get up there 
oh  rats 
  we got our frisbee stuck 
  how are we gonna get it down 
  go space shuttle 
  that s what i m thinking 
good idea 
  ready 
  okay 
 one  two  three  four  five  six
seven  grab  drop  catch 
  great job 
  go  buddy 
do they always get
so excited like that 
haven t you ever seen them
do their touchdown dances 
i mean  they flip all over the place 
you d think they were cheerleaders 
  no 
  you guys really like cheering 
that wasn t cheering 
just goofing around 
you nailed a backward sponge
and go cradle 
no  we threw my sister up in the air
to get our frisbee 
it was either that
or we get three ladders 
come on  guys 
you love cheering  don t run from it 
this is a safe place 
we kind of do  it s so much
more athletic than football 
if it were up to us  we d go
with you ladies to cheer camp 
but we re football meatheads 
we gotta march in lockstep
to what society expects 
don t tell anyone  okay 
totally ruin our rep 
  we ll catch you later 
  have a good summer 
we re gonna go watch
a bears  game on tv 
 go  bears 
i m supposed to believe
the biggest jocks in school   
all along really wanted
to be cheerleaders 
don t get caught up in the lockstep
of society s expectations 
they tossed poppy
like 20 feet in the air 
look  carly 
we don t have any muscle 
if you really wanna do better this year 
they re our only hope 
unless you guys wanna try steroids 
which i m totally open to 
  i m just saying 
  i don t care  i don t trust those guys 
they re not coming  i m the captain 
miss klingerhoff is the coach 
let s see what she thinks 
what a fantastic idea 
it s exactly what this squad needs
to just push it over the top 
but miss klingerhoff 
they have never done it before 
they don t know any of our cheers 
and  come on  it s nick and shawn 
don t judge a book
by its cover  carly 
you never really know what a book
is about until you get to page 50 
fifty 
  wouldn t guess a page over 40 
  more like 35 
my chickens 
you come here  you 
all right  one down  one to go 
what are we gonna say to coach
shit for words to get out of football 
what every kid says to get out
of everything he doesn t wanna do 
so not only do i find out yesterday
i m adopted   
the people i ve called mom and
dad are infertile imposters   
who bought me outside a meth clinic
for two boxes of sudafed   
but i also get
this news dropped on me 
my birth father  bruce   
well  he needs a kidney
and i m the only match 
and apparently bruce needs it stat 
you need it stat  bruce  huh 
i needed a father stat
instead of the stay at home dad   
who showers me with love every
day  this goddamn spermless liar 
so now i gotta be at kaiser
permanente tomorrow at 6 a  m 
i know  bruce couldn t even afford
a real hospital 
managed care  it s ironic  huh 
never managed to care for me 
you shitting me 
are you saying you can t go to camp

coach 
because it s eating me up inside 
it s eating me up 
shit 
  cheer camp  cheer camp

  one  two 
cheer camp  one  two 
you might have everyone else fooled 
but not me 
well  if being a fool

not only is that move nearly impossible
to execute  it s extremely dangerous 
that move is prohibidado
