wheres the car wheres the car
im getting scared hold my purse
two weeks shawn two weeks
i know
two weeks out of the best
years of our lives
two weeks were never
gonna get back like ever
i know
so are you guys psyched
for cheer camp or what
its like all i think about
know how martin luther king
had a dream well i do too
to kick ass at cheer camp and if
that makes me shallow then fine
call me and dr king shallow
that doesnt make you shallow
that makes you real
we have got to do better
than last year
we could take a dump in our pants
and still do better than last year
im just saying
but were better this year
and if we work hard
i think we have a real shot
i dont know
theres 300 girls up there
who want it just as much
as we do
and who are much better than us
three hundred girls
who want it just as much as we do
and are much better than us
tell you what man
thatd be the place to be
instead of sweating our balls off
in the desert with coach shitshit
so lets go
what
lets go to cheer camp
be cheerleaders
cheerleaders
yes
oh my god
are you coming out to me
im so proud of you man
and you know what
i kind of always knew
will you shut up all right
im too straight to be gay
i could suck knob
and still be straight
i could have one in my mouth
and two in each hand
and still win a straight award
all right
which is why i wanna go
to cheer camp think
three hundred hotties
weve never been with before
i wonder if they let guys
go to cheer camp
name name give me a name
carly shes the captain
hey carly
yeah i know its the most beautiful
name youve ever heard
my eyes look like forever
and you love every bone in my body
especially yours
no but thats good
mind if i use it
no no no lines
we wanted to wish you
luck at cheer camp
sure you do i know your game
no girl left unturned
what
how dare you
no we just see how hard
you ladies cheer out there
and we really hope
that you do good
yeah do us proud you know beat
the skirts off those 300 other girls
and guys are there guys there
do guys go
what about guys
its a good question
theres girls and guys that go
i dont know if guys
yes the good teams are all coed
thats interesting i just didnt
know that i was just pondering
carly come here were working on
a new mount bianca came up with
yeah
coming
im gonna walk away backwards
so you guys dont talk about my ass
man shes got nice lumps
either one of us ever hit that
i dont think so i think
she respects herself too much
right
who wants to deal with that drama
so what do you think
about cheer camp
what do you mean what do i think
lets go
were not cheerleaders
were athletes we can do anything
they dont just let anybody go
youve gotta be part of a squad
lets join a squad
how hard can this be
a couple of flips a pyramid
black sheep
three hundred honeys
on our biscuits
what about football camp
screw football
the only reason we started playing
was to pull chicks
you cant honestly tell me you enjoy
running in blazing hot pads
trying to catch a pass two seconds
before some 2000pound mongoloid
crashes into your nutter butters
el paso here we come
not if it comes to us first
oh shit
im on fire
mookie
water water water
ill put you out
im a hero
screw football lets go cheer
shawny shawn
we need to convince
the squad they need us
not gonna be easy
thats why we go to poppy
i wish there was another way
theres not
but i wish there was
but theres not were here
i wish we werent
but we are
hi sis
why am i looking at you speak
poppy youre getting so big now
how old are you
im 60 can we get past
the small talk
the only time you come to see me
is when you need something
what tug mags
mikes hard lemonade
another ride to the clinic
poppy
no we wanna go to that
cheerleading camp youre going to
since youre killing on the jv squad
and so advanced beyond your years
we thought youd get us
up to speed
hey buddy
you can piss on my face
just dont tell me its raining
you guys have been through
every girl at your school
and youre looking
for fresh muff
some itchyitchynahnah
walltowall carpet
okay seriously how old are you
tell you what ill teach you
some basic cheerleader moves
high vs low vs
touchdown baskets
dont the guys just throw
the girls up and then catch them
pretty much but ill let you practice
on me and tell you what theyre called
in exchange i get shawns room
no
done
those are my terms
well take them
dude ive got my own bathroom
dude after cheer camp you wont
even need your own bathroom
what what does that even mean
poppy you got yourself a deal
teach us we go see carly
wrong gossip girl
what
carlys not one of your humpetyhump
football groupies
shes too smart to buy that you guys
wanna be cheerleaders
okay so whats the play
here she comes here she comes
go go get up there
oh rats
we got our frisbee stuck
how are we gonna get it down
go space shuttle
thats what im thinking
good idea
ready
okay
one two three four five six
seven grab drop catch
great job
go buddy
do they always get
so excited like that
havent you ever seen them
do their touchdown dances
i mean they flip all over the place
youd think they were cheerleaders
no
you guys really like cheering
that wasnt cheering
just goofing around
you nailed a backward sponge
and go cradle
no we threw my sister up in the air
to get our frisbee
it was either that
or we get three ladders
come on guys
you love cheering dont run from it
this is a safe place
we kind of do its so much
more athletic than football
if it were up to us wed go
with you ladies to cheer camp
but were football meatheads
we gotta march in lockstep
to what society expects
dont tell anyone okay
totally ruin our rep
well catch you later
have a good summer
were gonna go watch
a bears game on tv
go bears
im supposed to believe
the biggest jocks in school
all along really wanted
to be cheerleaders
dont get caught up in the lockstep
of societys expectations
they tossed poppy
like 20 feet in the air
look carly
we dont have any muscle
if you really wanna do better this year
theyre our only hope
unless you guys wanna try steroids
which im totally open to
im just saying
i dont care i dont trust those guys
theyre not coming im the captain
miss klingerhoff is the coach
lets see what she thinks
what a fantastic idea
its exactly what this squad needs
to just push it over the top
but miss klingerhoff
they have never done it before
they dont know any of our cheers
and come on its nick and shawn
dont judge a book
by its cover carly
you never really know what a book
is about until you get to page 50
fifty
wouldnt guess a page over 40
more like 35
my chickens
you come here you
all right one down one to go
what are we gonna say to coach
shitforwords to get out of football
what every kid says to get out
of everything he doesnt wanna do
so not only do i find out yesterday
im adopted
the people ive called mom and
dad are infertile imposters
who bought me outside a meth clinic
for two boxes of sudafed
but i also get
this news dropped on me
my birth father bruce
well he needs a kidney
and im the only match
and apparently bruce needs it stat
you need it stat bruce huh
i needed a father stat
instead of the stayathome dad
who showers me with love every
day this goddamn spermless liar
so now i gotta be at kaiser
permanente tomorrow at 6 a m
i know bruce couldnt even afford
a real hospital
managed care its ironic huh
never managed to care for me
