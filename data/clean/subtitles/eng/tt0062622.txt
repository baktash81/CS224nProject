you dished the problem too soon 
i can t show my cool 
a dish was looking  you know

you had eyelid spasms and you sweated 
she was looking at me 
i was flirting with my eyes

tv is so important 
if not for us 
it could have been much worse 
sir  2002 needs
signatures from all precinct heads
in order to keep on going 
if you don t sign  it won t be approved 
since the others have signed 
it must be useful 
perhaps we cannot see them 
but some cases cannot be
explained by science 
a one person department is unusual 
but inspector yau can
communicate with that world 
for him to keep order there 
we don t see any problem 
no    
i won t sign 
you say that because
you re not the ones with problems
