i do like his cereal though
ill give him that
oh my gosh
dont cops run red lights
oh yeah some do
but not your dad
my memories keep begging
for someone else
i know this feeling yes
i know it very well
why cant i go back
to brooklyn middle
youve given it
two weeks
were not having
this conversation
i just think that
this new school is elitist
elitist
and i would prefer to be
at a normal school
among the people
the people
these are your people
im only here cause
i won that stupid lottery
no way you passed the entry
test just like everybody else okay
you have an opportunity here
you wanna blow that huh
you wanna end up
like your uncle
whats wrong with uncle aaron
hes a good guy
we all make choices in life
it doesnt feel
like i have
a choice right now
you dont
i love you miles
yeah i know dad
see you friday
you gotta say i love you back
dad are you serious
i wanna hear it i love you dad
you wanna hear me say it
youre dropping me off at a school
i love you dad
look at this place
dad i love you
dad i love you
thats a copy
tie your shoes please
i love you dad
hey good morning
how you doin
weekend was short huh
thats a copy
oh my gosh this is th
this is embarrassing
we wore
the same jacket
hey your shoes untied
yeah
yeah im aware
its a choice
theory is that
all matter is composed
of at least three
fundamental particles
who can solve this for xy
and that is known
as a syllogism
read two chapters
of great expectations
a takehome quiz
on volumetric pressure
fivepage essay
with your conclusions stressed
countless other possibilities
there could be a universe
where i am wearing red
or wearing leather pants
mr morales movin in the dark
youre late again
einstein said
time was relative right
maybe im not late
maybe you guys are early
sorry
it was just so quiet
would you like
to keep standing there
or do you wanna sit down
our universe is in fact
one of many parallel universes
happening
at the exact same time
thanks to everyone here at
the fisk family foundation
i liked your joke
really
i mean it wasnt funny
thats why i laughed
but it was smart
so i liked it
i dont know i dont think
ive seen you before
every choice that we make
would create countless
other possibilities
a whatif to infinity
a zero
a few more of those
youd probably have
to kick me outta here huh
maybe im just not right
for this school
if a person wearing a blindfold
picked the answers
on a trueorfalse quiz
at random
do you know
what score they would get
thats right
the only way to get
all the answers wrong
is to know
which answers are right
youre trying to quit
and im not gonna let you
im
assigning you a personal essay
not about physics
but about you
and what kind of person
you want to be
unh unh
unh unh
come on
ha sicker than
your average
poppa twist cabbage
off instinct

we interrupt this
broadcast for a special report
sad news tonight
the hero known as spiderman
has died
after injuries related to
another powerful earthquake
in brooklyn
multiple sources are confirming
that peter parker
a 26yearold grad student
and parttime photographer
operated as spiderman
for at least a decade
im not runnin
runnin runnin
no im not afraid
of the fall
im not scared
he is survived
by his wife mary jane
and his aunt may parker
our hero spiderman is gone
im not scared
my husband peter parker
was an ordinary person
he always said it couldve been
anyone behind the mask
he was just the kid
who happened to get bit
im going to miss him
yeah
we were friends
you know
can i return it
if it doesnt fit
it always fits
eventually
he didnt ask for his powers
but he chose to be spiderman
my favorite thing about peter
is that he made us each
feel powerful
we all have powers
of one kind or another
of the dark
but in our own way
we are all spiderman
and were all
counting on you
theyre counting on me
probably not you specifically
i think its a metaphor
im sorry mr parker
that thing you gave me
that key
i think i really messed it up
i wanna do what you asked
i really do
but
im sorry
im not sure
im the guy
i cant do this
without you
hey kid
whoa
what did i do to him
no
who are you
all right people
lets do this one last time
my name is peter b parker
i was bitten by
a radioactive spider
and for the last 22 years
i thought i was
the one and only spiderman
what a day
im pretty sure
you know the rest
you see i saved the city
fell in love i got married
saved the city some more
maybe too much
my marriage got testy
made some dicey money choices
dont invest
in a spiderthemed restaurant
then like 15 years passed
blah blah blah super boring
i broke my back
a drone flew into my face
i buried aunt may
my wife and i split up
but i handled it
like a champion
cause you know what
no matter
how many times i get hit
i always get back up
and i got a lot of time
to reflect and work on myself
did you know that seahorses
that they mate for life
could you imagine
a seahorse seeing
another seahorse
and then making it work
she wanted kids and
and it scared me
im pretty sure
i broke her heart
flash forward im in
my apartment doing pushups
doing ab crunches
getting strong
when this weird thing
happened
and i gotta say weird things
happen to me a lot
but this was real weird
ow
you see i was in new york
but things were different
also i was dead
and blond
i was kind of perfect
it was like
looking in a mirror
i have a feeling that
the thing
that brought me here
was the thing
that got him killed
you wanna know
what happened next
me too
who are you
what are
you doin over there
freeze pdny
stop
are you kidding me right now
stop stop
i gotcha i gotcha
hey kid drop the body
hey kid get over here

im not
im trying to save you
hey maybe you
guys can go around
all right thanks new york

kid electrocuted me
with his hands
youre like me
i got some questions
why do you look like
peter parker

then why arent you dead
and why is your hair different
why are you older
and why is your body
aa different shape
pretty sure
you just called me fat
no no you just
atleast you dont look
so hot either kid
most superheroes dont wear
their own merch
are you a ghost
no
are you a zombie
stop it
am i a zombie
youre not even close
are you from another dimension
like a parallel universe
where things are like
this universe but different
and youre spiderman
in that universe
but somehow traveled
to this universe
but you dont know how
wow that was really
just a guess
we learned about it
in physics
quantum theory
this is amazing
you can teach me
like peter said he would
before he died yeah right
yeah exactly
look i made a promise
to him
heres lesson number one
kid
dont watch the mouth
watch the hands
peter seriously
trust me kid
thisll all make you
a better spiderman
hey are you okay
no im not
whats going on
with your body
i dont think my atoms
are real jazzed
about being
in the wrong dimension
look im not looking
for a side gig
as a spiderman coach
i got a lot going on
in my dimension
with great power
comes great
dont you dare
finish that sentence
dont do it
im sick of it
want my advice
go back to being a regular kid
i dont have a choice
kingpins got
a supercollider
hes trying to kill me

who cares about that
wheres the collider
brooklyn under fisk tower
goodbye
where you going
when it runs again
ill jump in
and get back to my life
you cant let them run it
im supposed to destroy it
so it never runs again
or everyones gonna die

but theres always a little bit
of time before everybody dies
and thats when i do
my best work
arent you gonna
need this
aw you have a goober
give it
wwwait no not so fast

to destroy the collider
i need it to go home
no ill swallow it
dont play with me

see this is why
i never had kids
cant we make another one

thanks to you
i have to resteal what
your guy stole from alchemax
and make another one of these
if i dont turn off the collider
after you leave
everyone in this city
my parents my uncle and
millions of others will die
and youre just gonna
go home
and leave me here
to figure this out for myself
