i just think that
this new school is elitist 
 elitist  
and i would prefer to be
at a normal school
among the people 
 the people  
these are your people 
i m only here  cause
i won that stupid lottery 
no way  you passed the entry
test just like everybody else  okay 
you have an opportunity here 
you wanna blow that  huh 
you wanna end up
like your uncle 
what s wrong with uncle aaron 
he s a good guy 
we all make choices in life 
it doesn t feel
like i have
a choice right now 
you don t 
i love you  miles 
yeah  i know  dad 
see you friday 
you gotta say  i love you  back

tie your shoes  please 
 i love you  dad  
hey  good morning 
how you doin  
weekend was short  huh 
 that s a copy  
oh  my gosh  this is th
this is embarrassing 
we wore
the same jacket 
hey  your shoe s untied 
yeah 
yeah  i m aware 
it s a choice 
theory is that
all matter is composed
of at least three
fundamental particles
who can solve this for xy 
and that is known
as a syllogism 
read two chapters
of great expectations 
a take home quiz
on volumetric pressure 
five page essay
with your conclusions stressed 
countless other possibilities 
there could be a universe
where i am wearing red 
or wearing leather pants 
mr  morales  movin  in the dark 
you re late again 
einstein said
time was relative  right 
maybe i m not late 
maybe you guys are early 
sorry 
it was just so quiet 
would you like
to keep standing there 
or do you wanna sit down 
our universe is  in fact 
one of many parallel universes
happening
at the exact same time 
thanks to everyone here at
the fisk family foundation
i liked your joke 
really 
i mean  it wasn t funny 
that s why i laughed 
but it was smart 
so i liked it 
i don t know  i don t think
i ve seen you before   
every choice that we make
would create countless
other possibilities 
a what if to infinity 
a zero 
a few more of those 
you d probably have
to kick me outta here  huh 
maybe i m just not right
for this school 
if a person wearing a blindfold
picked the answers
on a true or false quiz
at random 
do you know
what score they would get 
50  
that s right 
the only way to get
all the answers wrong
is to know
which answers are right 
you re trying to quit 
and i m not gonna let you 
i m
assigning you a personal essay 
not about physics 
but about you 
and what kind of person
you want to be 
unh  unh

that s when
he s gotta stick it out 
we interrupt this
broadcast for a special report 
sad news tonight 
the hero known as spider man
has died
after injuries related to
another powerful earthquake
in brooklyn 
multiple sources are confirming
that peter parker 
a 26 year old grad student
and part time photographer
operated as spider man
for at least a decade 
i m not runnin 
runnin   runnin 
no  i m not afraid
of the fall
i m not scared
he is survived
by his wife  mary jane 
and his aunt  may parker 
our hero  spider man  is gone 
i m not scared
my husband  peter parker 
was an ordinary person 
he always said it could ve been
anyone behind the mask 
he was just the kid
who happened to get bit 
i m going to miss him 
yeah 
we were friends 
you know 
can i return it
if it doesn t fit 
it always fits
eventually 
he didn t ask for his powers 
but he chose to be spider man 
my favorite thing about peter
is that he made us each
feel powerful 
we all have powers
of one kind or another 
of the dark
but in our own way 
we are all spider man 
and we re all
counting on you 
they re counting on me 
probably not you specifically 
i think it s a metaphor 
i m sorry  mr  parker 
that thing you gave me 
that key 
i think i really messed it up 
i wanna do what you asked 
i really do 
but
i m sorry 
i m not sure
i m the guy 
i can t do this
without you 
hey  kid 
whoa 
what did i do to him  
no 
who are you 
all right  people 
let s do this one last time 
my name is peter b  parker 
i was bitten by
a radioactive spider 
and for the last 22 years 
i thought i was
the one and only spider man 
what a day 
i m pretty sure
you know the rest 
you see  i saved the city 
fell in love  i got married 
saved the city some more 
maybe too much 
my marriage got testy 
made some dicey money choices 
don t invest
in a spider themed restaurant 
then like 15 years passed 
blah  blah  blah  super boring 
i broke my back 
a drone flew into my face 
i buried aunt may 
my wife and i split up 
but i handled it
like a champion 
 cause  you know what 
no matter
how many times i get hit 
i always get back up 
and i got a lot of time
to reflect and work on myself 
did you know that seahorses 
that they mate for life 
could you imagine 
a seahorse seeing
another seahorse
and then making it work 
she wanted kids and
and it scared me 
i m pretty sure
i broke her heart 
flash forward  i m in
my apartment doing push ups 
doing ab crunches 
getting strong 
when this weird thing
happened 
and i gotta say  weird things
happen to me a lot 
but this was real weird 
ow 
you see  i was in new york 
but things were different 
also  i was dead 
and blond 
i was kind of perfect 
it was like
looking in a mirror 
i have a feeling that
the thing
that brought me here
was the thing
that got him killed 
you wanna know
what happened next 
me  too 
who are you 
what are
you doin  over there 
freeze  p d n y 
stop 
are you kidding me right now 
stop  stop 
i gotcha  i gotcha 
hey  kid  drop the body 
hey  kid  get over here 
come on  now

dragging a homeless corpse
behind a train

hey  maybe you
guys can go around

what was that 
kid electrocuted me
with his hands 
you re like me 
i got some questions 
why do you look like
peter parker

like a parallel universe
where things are like
this universe but different 
and you re spider man
in that universe 
but somehow traveled
to this universe 
but you don t know how 
wow  that was really
just a guess 
we learned about it
in physics 
quantum theory 
this is amazing 
you can teach me
like peter said he would 
before he died  yeah  right 
yeah  exactly 
look  i made a promise
to him 
here s lesson number one 
kid 
don t watch the mouth 
watch the hands 
peter  seriously
trust me  kid 
this ll all make you
a better spider man 
hey  are you okay 
no  i m not 
what s going on
with your body 
i don t think my atoms
are real jazzed
about being
in the wrong dimension 
look  i m not looking
for a side gig

at the beginning one last time 
my name is gwen stacy 
i was bitten by
a radioactive spider 
and for the last two years 
i ve been the one
and only spider woman 
you guys know the rest 
i joined a band 
saved my dad 
i couldn t save my best friend 
peter parker 
so now i save everyone else 
and i don t do friends
anymore 
just to avoid
any distractions 
and one day
this weird thing happened 
and i mean  like 
really weird 
i was blown into last week 
literally 
i landed in new york 
but not my new york 
lucky for these folks 
spider man was there
to save the day 
my spider sense told me
to head to visions academy 
you guys are early 
wasn t sure why
until i met you 
oh 
i like your haircut 
you don t get to like
my haircut 
let s go 
how many more spider people

i killed spider man 
why did i just see two more 
there s three  actually 
no  this is good 
this is very  very good 
this means

it means my collider works 
all we have to do is kill
a couple of spiders 
and the collider will bring
your family back 
as many families
as you want 
tomorrow  at my collider 
our collider 
he broke this 
yeah  he s actually
really embarrassed about it 
so just keep
it between us  okay 
i know where we
can make a new one 
and we won t let him
break it this time 
i m sorry about your friend 
thanks  miles 
i know
how hard this is 
to have to figure
this stuff out on your own 
it s kinda nice not being
the only spider person around 
yeah 
if you ever decide
to do friends again 
i could always open up a slot 
i ll keep you posted 
cool 
we should probably go 
peter  we re
literally on the doorstep 
bad idea  bad idea 
just relax 
this is a bad idea 
you guys are all very sweet 
but no more fans today 
please 
i m not ready for this

but he figured the only one
who could stop this guy
was spider man

outnumbered 
don t be
so sure 
you might need these 
you think you re the only people
who thought to come here
