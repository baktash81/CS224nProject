tj
x im over here x
there he is
we toasted his ass
i got us a bike
pussies
look who it is frankenstein uncuff me
so i can beat the shit out of you
relax x you just graduated
at the head of your ciass
what are you talking about
you almost got us killed
we knew the army was moving
excuse me
it was my idea to send you as
a decoy how do you like that
youre pretty fast for an old man
get up
walk with me
i believe under the right
circumstances a man can change
for instance last night you exhibited
courage leadership
and willingness to protect
a man you hardly knew
so give me a medal
id rather give you a job
look at me do i look like a fan
of law enforcement
this is your lucky day xander
this is your chance
to pay your uncle sam
for all your wonderful freedoms youve enjoyed
the jobs not that difficult
i want you to meet people and
find out whatever you can about them
what type of people
dangerous dirty tattooed
uncivilized your kind of people
hold up
my kind of people would say
kiss my ass scarface
usually id take my gun
press it to your temple
and ask you very politely
to do what i want
but youre not afraid of death
that puts us in a quandary
we better call this a day then
not just yet
you ever watch lions at the zoo
you can tell which were captured
in the wild by the look in their eyes
the wild cat
she remembers running across the plain
the thrill of the hunt
four hundred pounds of killing fury
locked in a box
but after a while
their eyes glaze over
and you can tell
their soul has died
the same thing happens to a man
leavenworth federal penitentiary
is no joke
theyll take a wild man and
throw him in solitary just for fun
no more mountains to board
no more oceans to surf
just a 6by8 cell with no window
and only a bucket to shit in
you can avoid that
by doing me this favor
you dont have shit on me
i noticed you have three xs
tattooed on the back of your neck
i think thats rather appropriate since
youre looking at three strikes
grand theft reckless endangerment
and that bridge stunt of yours
makes you a threetime loser
maybe you ought to call yourself
triple x
but if you do what i want ill make
all your transgressions go away
and let you get back
to that pathetic excuse of a life
or you think maybe
i should be like you
get all shot up for the old
stars and stripes
i bet that flag is a real comfort
every time you look in the mirror
a small price i paid for putting
foot to ass for my country
so whats it going to be triple x
you want to get on a plane
or is kiss my ass scarface
your final answer

imagine a city like prague vanishing
in a cloud of poison gas
then hamburg london washington
