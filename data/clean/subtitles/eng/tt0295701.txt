you know what  funny guy

last thing you re going to smell

virg  give me a hand

every man for himself 
i ll get us some wheels 
hang in there 
good luck 
the guy on the bike 
that s the drug lord 
let s get him 
t j  
x  i m over here  x 
there he is 
we toasted his ass 
i got us a bike 
pussies 
look who it is  frankenstein  uncuff me
so i can beat the shit out of you 
relax  x  you just graduated
at the head of your ciass 
what are you talking about 
you almost got us killed 
 we knew the army was moving 
 excuse me 
it was my idea to send you as
a decoy  how do you like that 
 you re pretty fast for an old man 
 get up 
walk with me 
i believe under the right
circumstances  a man can change 
for instance  last night you exhibited
courage  leadership   
   and willingness to protect
a man you hardly knew 
 so give me a medal 
 i d rather give you a job 
look at me  do i look like a fan
of law enforcement 
this is your lucky day  xander 
this is your chance
to pay your uncle sam   
   for all your wonderful freedoms you ve enjoyed 
the job s not that difficult 
i want you to meet people and
find out whatever you can about them 
what type of people 
dangerous  dirty  tattooed 
uncivilized  your kind of people 
hold up 
my kind of people would say 
 kiss my ass  scarface  
usually i d take my gun 
press it to your temple   
   and ask you very politely
to do what i want 
but you re not afraid of death 
that puts us in a quandary 
 we better call this a day  then 
 not just yet 
you ever watch lions at the zoo 
you can tell which were captured
in the wild by the look in their eyes 
the wild cat 
she remembers running across the plain 
the thrill of the hunt 
four hundred pounds of killing fury
locked in a box 
but after a while 
their eyes glaze over   
   and you can tell
their soul has died 
the same thing happens to a man 
leavenworth federal penitentiary
is no joke 
they ll take a wild man and
throw him in solitary just for fun 
no more mountains to board 
no more oceans to surf 
just a 6 by 8 cell with no window
and only a bucket to shit in 
you can avoid that
by doing me this favor 
you don t have shit on me 
i noticed you have three x s
tattooed on the back of your neck 
i think that s rather appropriate since
you re looking at three strikes 
grand theft  reckless endangerment 
and that bridge stunt of yours   
   makes you a three time loser 
maybe you ought to call yourself
 triple x  
but if you do what i want  i ll make
all your transgressions go away   
   and let you get back
to that pathetic excuse of a life 
or you think maybe
i should be like you 
get all shot up for the old
stars and stripes 
i bet that flag is a real comfort
every time you look in the mirror 
a small price i paid for putting
foot to ass for my country 
so  what s it going to be  triple x 
you want to get on a plane   
   or is  kiss my ass  scarface 
your final answer 
prague  czech republic

 conversation   a word
with four syllables 
do you want some ice

this would work a lot faster  princess 
if i had an account number

you had to shoot a cop  how
  not as bad as i think   could they be 
okay  look 
we ve got a complication 
there s a girl  yelena 
there s always a girl 
she wants out and i sent her back in
to get more intel for you 
there s no time to play favorites 
the cards have been dealt 
what do you mean
the cards have been dealt 
you don t even know her  man 
oh  by the way  that bank number
you gave us 
your friends and yelena have made
some large cash transfers   
   to a group of russian scientists
known to specialize and traffic   
   in biologicai  weapons 
 she had nothing to do with it 
 go home 
 she ain t   
 that s an order 
how s it going 
life is shit 
yeah  well what can you do 
through this door 
you are with us to the end 
 are you sure that s what you want 
 i m sure 
this is  ahab   think of it as
solar powered submarine 
it can circumnavigate the globe
to reach its target 
it need only surface to gather sunshine
and to do its business 
what is it  what s its business 
dropping off presents to all
the good little boys and girls 
my team will be finished tomorrow 
how about you 
we re finished now 
nikolai 
bring the rockets 
the detonator is for you 
yorgi  the binary agents are mixing   
   it will kill us all 
looks like little white mouse 
bye bye  little mouse 
my god 
they did their job
and now they were liability 
we don t need anyone
talking about our business 
the gas gets sucked through the
extractor fans  passed into water   
   and broken down to become 
once again  completely harmless 
so qulet 
i know now why they call it
silent night 
let s get some food 
find out what s going on 
what the hell was that 
that works 
fire in the hole 
sova  what are you doing here  man 
first you set me up in the bar 
then you shoot me in the back 
my boss does it to me 
i did it to you  it s a vicious circle 
 you think it s funny 
 no 
you didn t take it personally 
did you 
i did what i had to do to get in 
we re on the same side 
i m sorry  i switched sides 
you pushed me too far  my government
doesn t pay as well as yorgi 
my government pays twice as much  
think you could just walk
into the spy business   
    and have all the angies figured out 
 what are you going to do  shoot me 
where  in the head  to be quick 
or in the chest for an open casket 
so i can see your heart 
can i think about it 
what are you doing  
i heard you talking  i could tell
where you were in the room 
what are you doing with the ivans 
what s going on 
there s something i didn t
have the time to tell you 
i m an agent as well 
i m an agent for fsb 
russian intelligence 
you know  like your cia 
 i ve been undercover for two years 
 two years 
what was your plan 
let them die of old age 
there was no plan 
a year ago  intelligence gets
reorganized  i stop getting orders 
they forget about me  and i did what
i must to survive  you understand 
what do i understand 
i ve been an agent for a week 
but my boss needs to know
what we know now 
 okay 
 okay 
the submarine s purpose is to deploy
a nerve agent called silent night 
it s been missing since
the sovlet union s collapse in  91 
it can kill millions 
we knew they were up to something 
you found out 
 that s excellent work  triple x 
 there was never a sweeper team 
if i said don t jump off
the empire state building    
 you re right  i d definitely do it 
 i inspired you 
i m an authority figure 
that s what i m supposed to do 
look  my men are on this now 
  it s time for you to come home  
 what about yelena 
i m not authorized to give her asylum 
but i promise it ll be done
by the time you get here

how soon can yorgi launch this thing 
you were told to go home

if they get ahead of schedule 
it s everyone s 
he s got an army  a fortress 
you don t stand a chance 
i ve risked my life for stupid reasons 
this is the first one that makes sense 
this is not one of your stunts 
you ll die in this  you know that 
if you don t go back in there   
   he ll know something s wrong 
you can t ask me to go back there 
you can t 
you want to know something ironic 
i volunteered for this assignment 
i wanted to make a difference 
i fought for it 
then finish it

yelena  my sweet dove 
did you get confused 
your assignment was to kill the cop
after he killed x 
not good for undercover agent
from russian intelligence 
i knew about you all along   
   and it was my pleasure to twist
you and use you how i saw fit 
and you 
of all people 
i thought you d understand   
   what i m trying to accomplish 
can you imagine 
imagine a city like prague vanishing   
   in a cloud of poison gas 
then hamburg  london  washington 
imagine not knowing who did it  or why 
and so they turn on each other 
these guys attack those guys 
those guys invade these guys 
soon  whole world implodes 
imagine governments disappearing 
and in the end   
   imagine facing absolute 
beautiful freedom 
but neither of you will be there
to see it 
like viktor 
like koiya
