now fair hippolyta
our nuptial hour draws on a pace
four happy days
bring in another moon
but o me thinks how slow
this old moon wanes
she lingers my desires
like to a step dame or a dowager
long withering out
a young mans revenue
four days will quickly
steep themselves in night
four nights will quickly
dream away the time
and then the moon
like to a silver bow
newbent in heaven
shall behold the night
of our solemnities
happy be theseus
our renowned duke
thanks good egeus
whats the news with thee
full of vexation come i
with complaint against my child
my daughter hermia
egeus
stand forth demetrius
my noble lord
this man hath
my consent to marry her
stand forth lysander
this man hath bewitched
the bosom of my child
thou thou lysander
thou hast given her rhymes
and interchanged love tokens
with my child
with cunning hast thou filched
my daughters heart
turned her obedience
which is due to me
to stubborn harshness
and my gracious duke
be it so she will not
here before your grace
consent to marry
with demetrius
i beg the ancient
privilege of athens
as she is mine
i may dispose of her
and that shall be either
to this gentleman
or to her death
according to our law
immediately provided
in that case
what say you hermia
relent sweet hermia
and lysander yield
thy crazed title
to my certain right
you have her fathers love
demetrius
let me have hermias
do you marry him
cur cur
scornful lysander
true he hath my love
and what is mine
my love shall render him
and she is mine
and all my right of her
i do estate unto demetrius
i am my lord
as well derived as he
as well possessed
my love is more than his
and which is more than
all these boasts can be
i am beloved
of beauteous hermia
why should not i
then prosecute my right
demetrius
ill avouch it to his head
made love to
nedars daughter helena
and won her soul
and she sweet lady dotes
devoutly dotes
dotes in idolatry
upon this spotted
and inconstant man
i must confess
i have heard so much
i do entreat your grace
to pardon me
i know not by what power
i am made bold
nor how it may concern
my modesty
in such a presence here
to plead my thoughts
but i beseech your grace
that i may know
the worst that may
be fall me in this case
either to die the death
or to abjure forever
the society of men
and therefore fair hermia
question your desires
know of your youth
examine well your blood
whether if you yield not
to your fathers choice
you can endure
the livery of a nun
for aye to be
in shady cloister mewed
to live a barren sister
all your life
chanting faint hymns
to the cold fruitless moon
so will i grow
so live so die mylord
ere i will yield
my virgin patent up
unto his lordship
whose unwished yoke
my soul consents
not to give sovereignty
take time to pause
by the next new moon
upon that day
either prepare to die
for disobedience
to your fathers will
or else to wed demetrius
as he would
or on dianas altar to protest
for aye austerity
and single life
for you fair hermia
look you arm yourself
to fit your fancies
to your fathers will
come hippolyta
demetrius come
and come egeus
i have some private schooling
for you both
how now my love
why is your cheek so pale
how chance the roses there
do fade so fast
be like for want of rain
which i could well beteem them
from the tempest of my eyes
aye me
for aught
that i could ever read
could ever hear
by tale or history
the course of true love
never did run smooth
if there were
a sympathy in choice
war death or sickness
did lay siege to it
making it momentary as a sound
swift as a shadow
short as any dream
as brief as the lightning
in the collied night
that in a spleen
unfolds both heaven and earth
and ere a man hath power
to saybehold
the jaws of darkness
to devour it up
so quick bright things
come to confusión
therefore hear me hermia
i have a widow aunt
a do wager of great revenue
and she respects me
as her only son
helena demetrius
demetrius
demetrius
ohh
demetrius
how happy some
oer other some can be
through athens i am thought
as fair as she
but what of that
demetrius thinks not so
he will not know what all
but he do know
love looks not with the eyes
but with the mind
and therefore is winged cupid
painted blind
god speed fair helena
whit her away
call you me fair
that fair again unsay
demetrius loves your fair
ohappy fair
sickness is catching
o were favor so
yours would i catch
fair hermia ere i go
oteach me how you look
and with what art
you sway the motion
of demetrius heart
his folly helena
is no fault of mine
none but your beauty
would that fault were mine
take comfort
he no more shall see my face
lysanderand myself
shall fly this place
helen
to you our minds we will unfold
tomorrow night
when phoebe doth behold
her silver visage
in the watery glass
a time that lovers flights
doth still conceal
through athens gates
have we devised to steal
and thence from athens
turn away our eyes
to seek new friends
and stranger companies
egeus hermia
ohh
hermia
farewell sweetplay fellow
pray thou for us
and good luck grant thee
thy demetrius
egeus hermia
ohh

we will meet
and there we may rehearse
most obscenely
and courageously
take pains
be perfect
adieu
ere demetrius looked
on hermias eyne
he hailed down oaths
that he was only mine
and when this hail
some heat from hermia felt
so he dissolved
and showers of oaths did melt
i will go tell him
of fair hermias flight
then to the wood this very night
will he pursue her
get off
get off there
ah fie
oh sweet beauty
how now spirit
whit her wander you
over hill over dale
through bush
through a briar
over park over pale
through flood through a fire
i do wander everywhere
swifter than the moons sphere
and i serve the fairy queen
to dew her orbs upon the green
either i mistake your shape
and making quite
or else you are that shrewd
and knavish sprite
called robin goodfellow
are not you he
that frights the maidens
of the villagery
psst
skims milk and sometimes
labors in the quern
and bootless makes
the breathless housewife churn
are not you he
thou speaksta right
i am that merry wanderer
of the night
i jest to oberon
and make him smile
when i a fatand
beanfed horse beguile
neighing in likeness
of a filly foal
and sometimes
ugh
farewellthou lob of spirits
ill be gone
the queen and all herelves
come here anon
the king doth keep
his revels here tonight
take heed the queen come
not within his sight
for oberon
is passing fell
and wrath
hey
go on
ill met by moonlight
proud titania
whatjealous oberon
fairies skip hence
i have forsworn
his bed and company
tarry
rashwanton
am not i thy lord
then i must be thy lady
why art thou here
come from
the farthest steppe of india
but that for sooth
the bouncing amazon
your buskind mistress
and your warrior love
to theseus must be wedded
and you come to give their bed
joy and prosperity
how canst thou thus
for shame titania
glance at my credit
with hippolyta
knowing i know
thy love to theseus
these are the forgeries
of jealousy
and never since
the middle summers spring
met we on hill
in dale forest or mead
by paved fountain
or by rushy brook
but with thy brawls
thou hast disturbed our sport
therefore the winds
piping to us in vain
as in revenge
have sucked up from the sea
contagious fogs
which falling in the land
hath every pelting river
made so proud
that they have overborne
their continents
and this same progeny
of evils comes
from our debate
from our dissensión
we are their parents
and original
do you amend it then
it lies in you
why should titania
cross her oberon
i do but beg
a little changeling boy
to be my henchman
set your heart at rest
the fairyland buys
not the child of me
his mother was
a votaress of my order
and in the spiced indian air
by night full often
hath she gossiped by my side
and sat with me
on neptunes yellow sands
marking the embarked traders
on the flood
when we have laughed
to see the sails conceive
and growbigbellied
with the wanton wind
but she being mortal
of that boy did die
and for her sake
do i rear up her boy
and for her sake
i will not part with him
how long within this wood
intend you stay
perchance till after
theseuswedding day
if you will patiently
dance in our round
and see our moonlight revels
go with us
give me that boy
and i will go with thee
not for thy fairy kingdom
fairies away
we shall chide downright
if i longer stay
well go thy way
thou shalt not from this grove
till i torment thee
for this injury
my gentle puck come hit her
thou rememberest
since once i sat
upon a promontory
and heard a mermaid
on a dolphins back
uttering such dulcet
and harmonious breath
that the rude sea
grew civil a ther song
that verytime i saw
but thou couldst not
flying between the cold
moon and the earth
cupid all armed
a certain aim he took
and loosed his love shaft smartly
from his bow
yet marked i where
the bolt of cupid fell
it fell upon
a little western flower
before milkwhite
now purple with loveswound
fetch me that flower
the juice of it
on sleeping eyelids laid
will make all man all woman
madly dote
upon the next live creature
that it sees
fetch me this herb
and be thou here again
ere the leviathan
can swim a league
ill puta girdle
round about the earth
in 40 minutes
having once this juice
ill watch titania
when shes asleep
and drop the liquor of it
in hereyes
the next thing then
she waking looks upon
she shall pursue it
with the soul oflove
and ere i take this charm
from off her sight
ill make her render up
herpage to me
ill make her render up
herpage to me
i love thee not
therefore pursue me not
where is lysanderand fair hermia
thou toldst me they were
stolen unto this wood
and here am i
and wode within this wood
because i cannot meet my hermia
hence
get thee gone
and follow me no more
do i entice you
do i speak you fair
or rather do i not
in plainest truth tell you
i do not
nor i cannot love you
and even for that
do i love you the more
i am your spaniel
and demetrius
the more you beat me
i will fawn on you
use me but as your spaniel
spurn me strike me
neglect me lose me
but give me leave
unworthy as i am
to follow you
what worser place
can i beg in your love
than to be used
as you use your dog
tempt not too much
the hatred of my spirit
for i am sick
when i do look on thee
and i am sick
when i look not on you
do
impeach your modesty
too much
to leave the city
and commit yourself
into the hands of one
that loves you not
to trust the opportunity
of night
and the ill counsel
of a desert place
with the richworth
of your virginity
your virtue
is my privilege
for that
it is not night
when i do see your face
therefore i think
i am not in the night
nor doth this wood
lack worids of company
for you in my respect
are all the worid
ill run from thee
and hide me in the brakes
and leave thee to
the mercy of wild beasts
the wildest hath not
such a heart as you
run when you will
the story shall be changed
apollo flies
and daphne holds the chase
the dove pursues the griffin
i will not stay thy questions
let me go
or if thou follow me
do not believe
but i shall do thee
mischief in the wood
aye in the temple
in the town in the field
you do me mischiefoh
fie demetrius
your wrongs do set
a scandal on my sex
oh
we cannot fight for love
as men may do
we should be wooed
and were not made to woo
ill follow thee
and make a heaven of hell
to die upon the hand
i love so well
fare thee well nymph
ere he shall leave this grove
thou shalt fly him
and he shall seek thy love
hast thou the flower there
ahh
i know a bank where
the wild thy me blows
where oxlips and
the nodding violet grows
quite over canopied
with the luscious woodbine
with sweetmuskroses
and with eglantine
there sleeps titania
sometime of the night
lulled in these flowers
with dances and delight
and there the snake
throws her enameled skin
weed wide enough
to wrap a fairy in
with the juice of this
ill streak her eyes
and make her full
of hateful fantasies
take thou some of it
and seek through this grove
a sweet athenian lady
is in love
with a disdainful youth
anoin this eyes
but do it when
the next thing he espies
maybe the lady
thou shalt know the man
by the athenian garments
he hath on
and look
thou meet me ere
the firstcock crow
fear not my lord
your servant shall do so
hello my queen
how sweet hello
sing me now asleep
then to thy offices
and let me rest
hence away
now all is well
one a loof stands sentinel
what thou seest
when thou dost awake
do it for thy true love take
love
and languish for his sake
be it ounce orcator bear
pard or boar
with bristled hair
in thy eye that doth appear
when thou wakest
it is thy dear
wake when some vile thing
is near
fairlove
you faint when wandering
in the wood
and to speak troth
i forgot our way
oh
well rest us hermia
if you think it good
and tarry for the comfort
of the day
be it so lysander
well find you out a bed
for i upon this bank
shall rest my head
lysander
one turfshall serve
as pillow for us both
one heart one bed
two bosoms and one troth
nay good lysander
for my sake my dear
lie further off yet
do not lie so near
ohtake the sense
sweet of my innocence
i mean
that my heart unto yours is knit
so that but one heart
we can make of it
two bosoms
interchained with an oath
so then two bosoms
in a single troth
then by your side
no bedroom me deny
for lying so hermia
i do not lie
lysander riddles very prettily
mmm
nay gentle friend
mmm
for love and courtesy
lie further off
in human modesty
such separation
as may well be said
becomes a virtuous bachelor
and a maid
so far be distant
and good night sweet friend
thy love neer alter
till thy sweet life end
amen
amen to that fair prayer
say i
and then end life
when i end loyalty
here is my bed
sleep give thee all his rest
with half that wish
the wishers eyes be pressed
through the forest have i gone
but athenian found i none
on whose eyes i might approve
this flowers force
in stirring love
night
and silence
but who is here
weeds of athens
he doth wearoh
this is he my master said
despised the athenian maid
and there the maiden
sleeping sound
on the dank and dirty ground
pretty soul
she durst not lie
with this lacklove
this killcourtesy
churl
upon thy eyes i throw
all the power
this charm doth owe
when thou wakest
let love forbid
sleep his seaton thy eyelid
and so awake when i am gone
for i must now
to oberon
i charge thee hence
and do not haunt me thus
ohwilt thou darkling leave me
do not so
stay on thy peril
i alone will go
i am out of breath
in this fond chase
the more my prayer
the lesser is my grace
happy is hermia
where soeer she lies
for she hath blessed
and attractive eyes
how came her eyes so bright
not with salt tears
if so my eyes are oftener
washed than hers
no
no no
no
i am asugly
as a bear
for beasts that meet me
run away for fear
lysander
dead or asleep
lysander if you live
good sir awake
oh
and run through fire
i will for thy sweet sake
where is demetrius
oh how fit a word
is that vile name
to perish on my sword
do not say so lysander
say not so
what
though he love your hermia
lord what though
yet hermia still loves you
then be content
content with hermia
no i do repent
the tedious minutes
i with her have spent
not hermia but helena i love
who will not change
a raven for a dove
wherefore was i
to this keen mockery born
when at your hands
did i deserve such scorn
ist not enough
ist not enough young man
that i did never
no nor never can
deserve a sweetlook
from demetrius eye
but you must flout
my insufficiency
oh but fare you well
per force i must confess
i thought you lord
of more true gentleness
she sees not hermia
hermia sleeps thou there
and never mayst thou come
lysander near
and all my powers
address your love and might
to honor helen
and to be her knight
aye me
for pity
what a dream was here
ohh
lysander look how i do quake
with fear
lysander
lysander
lysander
heres a marvelous
convenient place
for our rehearsal
this green plot
shall be our stage
this hawthorn brake
our tiring house
and we will uh
do it in action
as we will do it
before the duke
peterquince
what sayest thou
bully bottom
there are things in this
comedy of pyramus and
thisby
thisby that will never please
first pyramus must draw a sword
to kill himself
which the ladies cannot abide
by our lady a parlous fear
i believe we must
leave the killing out
when all is done
not a whit
i have a device to make all well
write me a prologue
and let the prologue seem to say
we will do no harm
with our swords
and that pyramus is not
killed indeed
and for the more better assurance
tell them that i pyramus
am not pyramus
but bottom the weaver
this will put them out of fear
ohwell we will have
such a prologue
and it shall be written
in uh 8 and 6
no make it 2 more
let it be written
in 8 and 8
but there is 2 hard things
that is to bring
the moonlight into a chamber
for you know pyramus
and thisby meet by moonlight
doth the moon shine
that night we play our play
a calendar a calendar
calendar
look in the almanac
find out if the moon shine

it doth shine that night
why then may you leave
a casement
of the great chamber window
open where we play
and the moon may shine in
at the casement
two hard things
we must have a wall
in the greatchamber
for pyramus and thisby
says the story
did talk through
the chink of a wall
you can never bring in a wall
what say you bottom
some man
or other must present wall
uh sam sam
and let him have some plaster
or some loam or some
rough cast about him
to signify wall
and let him hold his fingers thus
and through that cranny
shall pyramus and
starvelingthisby
thisby whisper
you can never bring in a wall
no no no
a and if this maybe
then all is well
pyramus you begin
and when you have
spoken your speech
enter into that brake

to fright me if they could
but i will not stir
from this place
do what they can
and i will sing
that they shall hear
i am not afraid
the woosel cock
so black of hue
with orangetawnybill
the throstle
with his note so true
the wren with little quill
what ángel wakes me
from my flowery bed
the finchthe sparrow
and the lark
the plainsong cuckoo gray
whose note so many
a man doth mark
and dares not answer nay
i pray thee gentle mortal

mine earis much enamored
of thy note
so is mine eye
enthralled to thy shape
and thy fair virtues
force per force
doth move me on the first view
to sayto swear
i love thee
m mme thinks mistress
you should have
little reason for that
and yet
to say the truth
reason and love keep little
company together nowadays
nay i can gleek
upon occasión
thou art as wise
as thou art beautiful
not so neither
if i have wit enough
to get out of this wood
i have enough to serve
mine own turn
out of this wood
do not desire to go
oh
aah
thou shalt remain here
whether thou wilt or no
ill give thee fairies
to attend on thee
and they shall fetch thee jewels
from the deep
and sing while thou
on pressed flowers dost sleep
and i will purge
thy mortal grossness so
that thou shalt
like an airy spirit go
peaseblossom cobweb
ready
and i
moth and mustardseed
and i
and i
where shall we go
be kind and courteous
to this gentleman
hop in his walks
and gambol in his eyes
feed him with apricocks
and dewberries
with purple grapes
green figs
and mulberries
nod to him elves
and do him courtesies
i cry your worships mercy
heartily
i beseech your worships name
cobweb

that next came in her eye
which she must dote on
in extremity

i took him sleeping
that is finishedtoo
demetriusso bitter

if thou hast slain lysander
in his sleep
being oer shoes in blood
plunge in the deep
and kill metoo
this is the same athenian
this is the woman
uhhuh
but not this the man
the sun was not
so true unto the day
as he to me
would he have stolen away
from sleeping hermia

i had rather give
his carcass to my hounds
ohh out dog
