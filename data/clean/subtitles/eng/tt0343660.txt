cool local places

snorkeling
mountain climbing
we went cliff diving
well we got a little drunk
he gave me
a back rub
we slow danced
in the rain
but it wasnt just about the sex
he pounded me like a mallard duck
it ended kind of weird though
when i asked for his number
he said hes
married
gay
entering the priesthood
he doesnt believe in phones
he just kind of ran away

a little fling but

of recent physical intimacy
shut up because here comes
onetimeonly opportunity
what i will do now is go into
your office and become naked
next move is up to you
i may not be as limber
as i once was
but i make up for it with enthusiasm
and willingness to experiment
i dont know if you realize
im not into guys
hey mr peanut butter cups

couldnt get enough of that spam
fry some up and throw
some eggs on it

a walrus this morning
and i thought i got most of it
off of me but guess i didnt
i love that smell
no you dont
fish dont even like that smell
no i do my dads a fisherman
he and my brother doug they go
out to sea for months at a time
and i miss them so much while theyre
gone that when they come back
i just hold on to them
for five minutes each
and they smell just like your hands
its the best smell in the world
well my fingers are available
for your sniffing pleasure
anytime you need them
wanna
okay
sea lions are known
for their athleticism
and dolphins are known
for their intelligence
walruses are known for their
tusks
their tusks also their male parts
can get pretty gigantic
yeah yeah its the second biggest
out of all the mammals
whats the first
i think tattooface
i like your laugh
i like you making me laugh
i hate to break this up
but were setting up for lunch
oh okay sorry sue
and the real cool thing about walruses
is theyre very mysterious
mysterious
yeah yeah
we dont really know what
theyre like in the wild
dont they just sleep on icebergs
and yawn all the time
all we really see is what they do
outside of the water
but who knows what
they do under the ice
where they spend
twothirds of their lives
well maybe theyre intimidating the
other creatures with their big winkies
that is one theory
i have to go
where you going
its my dads birthday and we go
every year and we pick a pineapple
its a tradition
that sounds nice okay well
i had a great time
me too
okay
would you like to have breakfast

actually im not drunk at all
noreen and neither are you

your ability to stay awake
and have guiltfree
vigorous sex with me

lucy is a very special person
very different from other people
okay
about a year ago lucy was
in a terrible car accident
she and her father went up
north shore to get a pineapple
her father broke some ribs but lucy
suffered a serious head injury
she lost her shortterm memory
so she cant remember anything
no no no she has all of her
longterm memory
thats a different part
of the brain
her whole life up to the night before
the accident she remembers
she just cant retain
any new information
its like her slate gets wiped clean
every night while she sleeps
hold on this sounds like something
i would tell a psycho girl
so shed stop calling me
am i the psycho girl
i wish i was making this up
she has no memory
that she ever met you
what about the
pineapplepicking thing
she says that every day
because each morning
she wakes up thinking its
october 13th of last year
she comes for breakfast because
thats what she did on sundays
and october 13th
was a sunday
she has no idea
its more than a year later
she reads the newspaper
its a special paper her father
puts on their porch
its from the day of her accident
he got hundreds of them printed
lucy does the same thing every day

to convert shortterm memory into
longterm memory while you sleep
the conditions come to be known
as goldfield syndrome
whos goldfield
a brilliant lithuanian psychiatrist
he himself suffered
temporallobe damage
took him four years
to publish his findings
because he had to keep
starting over from scratch
obviously your sense of humor
is still intact and thats here
magnificent amygdala as well

hygienic facility shirts are required

where i first saw your face
we liked each other right away
but you didnt remember me
the very next day
forgetful lucy
has got a nice caboosey
i used to trick you into pulling
your car over so we could chat
but my favorite time was when you
beat the shit out of ula with a bat
and we drove up to see dr keats
and found out why doug always
has to change his sheets
forgetful lucy
cracked her head like gary busey
but i still love her so
and ill never let her go
even if while im singing this song
shes wishing i had
jocko the walrus schlong
forgetful lucy
her lips are so damn juicy

youre an art teacher and you go
to the hukilau every sunday
and you make waffle houses
and you like casablanca lilies
stalker
no dont you remember me a little
i may not be able to kick your ass
but my sister can
thanks buddy
little sammy sosas a bit shook up
but shell be okay
shes watching the tape as we speak
hows my temporal lobe
looking there doc
dont worry youre not gonna suffer
any shortterm memory loss
but was your head shaped like an egg
before she hit you
dont make fun of henry
its not his fault its shaped like that
note the intense overreaction
thats the roids talking
doug once again off the juice
its not juice
its a protein shake
henry the boys tell me youre setting
sail for alaska to study walruses
when does that adventure begin
that actually began
ten years ago thats when i started
planning and building my boat
all i know is out of all mammals
they have the secondlargest penis
i have the first
thats my joke
did you tell lucy about this trip
well
actually theres nothing to tell
because i decided not to go
i mean lucy needs me here
im just worried about
going away for a year
and ruining all the progress
shes made
i know you think im crazy
but i think deep down inside
shes starting to remember me
no henry
thats what you want to believe
its what we all want to believe
but its never gonna happen
okay i gotta go to work
will you tell her ill be back later
to pick her up
see you guys dont tell anyone
your sister beat me up
he could go to the moon and back and
lucy would never even know he left
sometimes i wish my wife
had goldfield syndrome
that way she wouldnt remember
when i called her mother
a loud obnoxious drunk with a face
like j edgar hoovers ass
all right theres your medicine
little fellow
ula get back to cleaning the pool
if thats one of your special brownies
dont let any of the dolphins eat that
how do you think i get them to
double flip and play with white kids

oh its fine dont worry
good
what brings your royal cuteness
out here
i needed to see you
okay what you got there
its my journal i write in it every night
oh you dont like the video
no i love it
its just sometimes when i watch it
i feel like im being told about my life
from someone else
and when i read this
its like im telling myself
when did you start this up
right after you gave me the video
really
i was so nervous to come here
and meet the guy that makes me
fall in love with him every day
well you probably thought
i couldnt live up to the hype
no i was nervous because
because i came here
to break up with you
you had plans and a life
before you met me
and now all you have time for
is to make me fall in love with you
thats not all i do
i gave a penguin a bath today
which ill have to do again tomorrow
i look at my dad and my brothers
lives and i wont do that to you
what do you want me to do be some
chapter in your scrapbook and go
no
my plan is to erase you completely
so its as if you never existed
why are you doing this
because you have to understand
that there is no future with me
dont you want to have a career
and marriage and children
i asked you to marry me you said yes
kids yeah id love to do it
but how is that going to work
im gonna wake up every morning with
an enormous belly and no memory
of how it happened
i have to make a new journal
that doesnt have you in it
but before i do
i really want you to read
what i wrote about you
i will read about it tomorrow
when you forget about all this
breaking up stuff okay
im not going to forget it
i wrote it down i wont let myself
and im gonna do it whether
you want me to or not
ill be at my house
