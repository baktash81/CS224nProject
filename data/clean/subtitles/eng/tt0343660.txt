  oh  yeah 
  well  what happened 
  i met this guy 
it was the best week of my life 
it was just a little
vacation romance 
but he was so sweet 
he took me to all these
cool local places 
we went scuba diving   
  snorkeling 
  mountain climbing 
we went cliff diving 
well  we got a little drunk 
  he gave me   
  a back rub 
we slow danced   
   in the rain 
but it wasn t just about the sex 
he pounded me like a mallard duck 
it ended kind of weird  though 
when i asked for his number 
he said he s   
  married 
  gay 
  entering the priesthood 
  he doesn t believe in phones 
he just kind of ran away 
you know  it was just
a little fling  but   
i won t forget my week   
   with henry roth 
  henry roth 
  harry 
harry paratesticles 
  henry roth

she has yet undertaken   
   and its completion will signal
that she s ready   
   for our great journey
to bristol bay   
   whose unspoiled walrus habitat
will yield an abundance of

is afraid of commitment 
let me guess 
your high school sweetheart
got drunk at party   
   then cheated on you
with whole wrestling team 
close  actually  it was my
college girlfriend tracy 
and it wasn t a wrestling team 
it was her academic advisor

  older women  about 50 years older 
i hope you shot the stupid tramp 
what s with the  tramp 
and the  bitches  talk 
  are you drunk or something 
  i apologize for nasty talk 
i am grouchy due to lack
of recent physical intimacy 
shut up  because here comes
one time only opportunity 
what i will do now is go into
your office and become naked 
next move is up to you 
i may not be as limber
as i once was   
   but i make up for it with enthusiasm
and willingness to experiment 
i don t know if you realize 
i m not into guys 
hey  mr  peanut butter cups 
hey  mr  could kill me in one punch 
how you doing

  you got it 
  all right  mahalo 
  hi  lucy 
  hi  nick

it s kind of a hinge 
  now  why didn t i think of that

an outsider s perspective 
fresh eye never hurts 
i m lucy

a walrus this morning   
   and i thought i got most of it
off of me  but guess i didn t 
  i love that smell 
  no  you don t 
  fish don t even like that smell 
  no  i do  my dad s a fisherman 
he and my brother doug  they go
out to sea for months at a time 
and i miss them so much while they re
gone that when they come back   
   i just hold on to them
for five minutes each 
and they smell just like your hands 
it s the best smell in the world 
well  my fingers are available   
   for your sniffing pleasure
anytime you need them 
  wanna 
  okay 
sea lions are known
for their athleticism   
   and dolphins are known
for their intelligence 
  walruses are known for their   
  tusks 
their tusks  also their male parts
can get pretty gigantic 
yeah  yeah  it s the second biggest
out of all the mammals 
  what s the first 
  i think tattoo face 
i like your laugh 
i like you making me laugh 
i hate to break this up 
but we re setting up for lunch 
oh  okay  sorry  sue 
and the real cool thing about walruses
is they re very mysterious 
  mysterious 
  yeah  yeah 
we don t really know what
they re like in the wild 
don t they just sleep on icebergs
and yawn all the time 
all we really see is what they do
outside of the water   
   but who knows what
they do under the ice   
   where they spend
two thirds of their lives 
well  maybe they re intimidating the
other creatures with their big winkies 
that is one theory 
  i have to go 
  where you going 
it s my dad s birthday  and we go
every year and we pick a pineapple 
  it s a tradition

noreen  and neither are you   
   because there s no alcohol
in these drinks 
sadly  i ve used this technique
many times 
it helps lovely tourists 
such as yourself   
   loosen up without impairing
your ability to stay awake   
   and have guilt free 
vigorous sex with me 
  wow 
  i m sorry 
i m not a cliff diver  either 
i m afraid of heights 
well  since it s my last night in town   
   can i pretend you didn t just say that
and still have sex with you anyway 
i can t do it  i m sorry 
well  can you at least point me in
the direction of someone who can 
that guy over there

hi

my fingers are extra fishy today 
if you care to take a whiff 
what was that 
i was petting my walrus all morning
and thinking of you the whole time 
okay  pervert 
i think that you should leave 
what  i was joking because
of what we talked about yesterday 
yesterday 
i ve never even met you 
  nick  i need help 
  coming  lucy 
nick  put that down 
i ll handle it 
  you  follow me 
  wait a    what s going on 
i was kidding around with you 
what s happening here 
is she crazy or something 
lucy is a very special person 
very different from other people 
okay 
about a year ago  lucy was
in a terrible car accident 
she and her father went up
north shore to get a pineapple 
her father broke some ribs  but lucy
suffered a serious head injury 
she lost her short term memory 
so she can t remember anything 
no  no  no  she has all of her
long term memory 
that s a different part
of the brain 
her whole life  up to the night before
the accident  she remembers 
she just can t retain
any new information 
it s like her slate gets wiped clean
every night while she sleeps 
hold on  this sounds like something
i would tell a psycho girl   
   so she d stop calling me 
am i the psycho girl 
i wish i was making this up 
she has no memory
that she ever met you 
what about the
pineapple picking thing 
she says that every day 
because each morning   
   she wakes up thinking it s
october 13th of last year 
she comes for breakfast because
that s what she did on sundays   
   and october 13th
was a sunday 
she has no idea
it s more than a year later 
she reads the newspaper 
it s a special paper her father
puts on their porch 
it s from the day of her accident 
he got hundreds of them printed 
lucy does the same thing every day 
  hello 
  back here 
  hi  dad 
  oh  hi  sweetie

the lady at the farmers  market
gave it to me as a birthday present 
i didn t wanna hurt her feelings

well  i have another idea 
i painted my workshop yesterday

and promise that we can pick
a pineapple for thanksgiving  okay 
  sounds great 
  okay  good

if you know her condition  you know
she can t have a normal relationship 
the next morning 
she won t know who he is

if you promised a girl s dad
that you wouldn t see her   
   would you consider that
a binding promise 
  absolutely 
  yeah 
then again  there are always ways
around such things 
  like 
  for example   
   if i promised a woman s father
i would not see her   
   i would simply shut my eyes
while she serviced my manhood 
that s actually a cool way to look at it 
and a very gross way 
he asked me not to go to the hukilau

what the hell s her problem 
she doesn t remember
who you are  brah 
oh  yeah 
i suck at this job 
lucy  these are your
brain scans here 
i m afraid they show
no improvement 
the temporal lobe
was severely damaged 
what we believe is scar tissue
here is impairing your ability   
   to convert short term memory into
long term memory while you sleep 
the condition s come to be known
as goldfield syndrome 
  who s goldfield 
  a brilliant lithuanian psychiatrist 
he himself suffered
temporal lobe damage 
took him four years
to publish his findings   
   because he had to keep
starting over from scratch 
obviously  your sense of humor
is still intact  and that s here 
magnificent amygdala as well 
  doctor  i have a question 
  i d be happy to answer it   
   but as i ve told you before  this is a
hygienic facility  shirts are required 
  oh  okay 
  nice move 
listen  doctor  this   
   friend of mine s been experimenting
a little with steroids 
he s been having a lot
of wet dreams 
could there be a connection
between them 
douglas  get off the juice 
as for the nocturnal emissions 
why don t you take a swim   
   buy a shirt with no holes 
find a wahine and take her to dinner 
i ll tell my friend you said so

your condition is stable   
   but most likely permanent

okay  let s average it out then 
it s the 23rd time for me

boob access

the hukilau was the place
where i first saw your face
we liked each other right away
but you didn t remember me
the very next day
forgetful lucy
has got a nice caboose y
i used to trick you into pulling
your car over so we could chat
but my favorite time was when you
beat the shit out of ula with a bat
and we drove up to see dr  keats
and found out why doug always
has to change his sheets
forgetful lucy
cracked her head like gary busey
but i still love her so
and i ll never let her go
even if while i m singing this song
she s wishing i had
jocko the walrus  schlong
forgetful lucy
her lips are so damn juicy
how about another first kiss

i m not sleeping 
i m just closing my eyes 
well  i m gonna go downstairs then

lucy

lucy  lucy  hey  hey  hey 
i know this is hard for you
to understand   
   but we are actually
seeing each other 
we have been for a while now 
oh  lucy  lucy  lucy 
if i was lying 
how would i know this 
you re an art teacher and you go
to the hukilau every sunday   
   and you make waffle houses
and you like casablanca lilies 
  stalker 
  no  don t you remember me a little 
i may not be able to kick your ass 
but my sister can 
thanks  buddy 
little sammy sosa s a bit shook up 
but she ll be okay 
she s watching the tape as we speak 
how s my temporal lobe
looking there  doc 
don t worry  you re not gonna suffer
any short term memory loss 
but was your head shaped like an egg
before she hit you 
don t make fun of henry 
it s not his fault it s shaped like that 
note the intense overreaction 
that s the  roids  talking 
  doug  once again  off the juice 
  it s not juice 
it s a protein shake 
henry  the boys tell me you re setting
sail for alaska to study walruses 
  when does that adventure begin 
  that actually began   
   ten years ago  that s when i started
planning and building my boat 
all i know is  out of all mammals 
they have the second largest penis 
i have the first 
that s my joke 
did you tell lucy about this trip 
well   
   actually  there s nothing to tell
because i decided not to go 
i mean  lucy needs me here 
i m just worried about
going away for a year   
   and ruining all the progress
she s made 
i know you think i m crazy   
   but i think deep down inside   
      she s starting to remember me 
  no  henry 
that s what you want to believe 
it s what we all want to believe 
but it s never gonna happen 
okay  i gotta go to work 
will you tell her i ll be back later
to pick her up 
see you  guys  don t tell anyone
your sister beat me up 
he could go to the moon and back and
lucy would never even know he left 
sometimes i wish my wife
had goldfield syndrome 
that way she wouldn t remember
when i called her mother   
   a loud  obnoxious drunk with a face
like j  edgar hoover s ass 
all right  there s your medicine 
little fellow 
ula  get back to cleaning the pool 
if that s one of your special brownies 
don t let any of the dolphins eat that 
how do you think i get them to
double flip and play with white kids 
okay  willie  that s it 
this time try to stay clean
for more than a day 
i made you a nice anchovy sundae 
okay  enjoy that 
henry 
  hey 
  how s your head 
  oh  it s fine  don t worry 
  good 
what brings your royal cuteness
out here 
i needed to see you 
okay  what you got there 
it s my journal  i write in it every night 
  oh  you don t like the video 
  no  i love it 
it s just sometimes when i watch it 
i feel like i m being told about my life   
   from someone else 
and when i read this   
   it s like i m telling myself 
when did you start this up 
right after you gave me the video 
  really 
  i was so nervous to come here   
   and meet the guy that makes me
fall in love with him every day 
well  you probably thought
i couldn t live up to the hype 
no  i was nervous because   
because i came here
to break up with you 
you had plans and a life   
   before you met me
and now all you have time for   
   is to make me fall in love with you 
that s not all i do 
i gave a penguin a bath today 
which i ll have to do again tomorrow 
i look at my dad and my brother s
lives and i won t do that to you 
what do you want me to do  be some
chapter in your scrapbook and go 
no 
my plan is to erase you completely 
so it s as if you never existed 
why are you doing this 
because you have to understand
that there is no future with me 
don t you want to have a career
and marriage and children 
i asked you to marry me  you said yes 
kids  yeah  i d love to do it 
but how is that going to work 
i m gonna wake up every morning with
an enormous belly and no memory   
   of how it happened 
i have to make a new journal
that doesn t have you in it 
but before i do   
   i really want you to read
what i wrote about you 
i will read about it tomorrow   
   when you forget about all this
breaking up stuff  okay 
i m not going to forget it 
i wrote it down  i won t let myself 
and i m gonna do it whether
you want me to or not 
i ll be at my house 
okay  type this one in there 
saturday  november 25th

to put that in 
  we can skip that one 
  no  let me read it 
we made love tonight  it didn t
last long  but it was incredible
