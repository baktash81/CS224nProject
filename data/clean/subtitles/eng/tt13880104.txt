i like men with ties 
yeah but you like all men 
look    you see 
he s your type too 
careful 
let me guess    literature 
easy  all girls do lit 
that s an overstatement 
i m doing history 
oh yeah 
no  it s not true 
i m in disguise 
they let us in  so i made an effort 
i came with those guys 
we re from the fire station nearby 
you re a fireman 
is that a problem 
they say beware of fireman 
my conscience is clear 
don t want to dance 
buy me a coke  jean 
sure 
a coke  please 
those girls really adore you 
they re just spying on me 
it suits them to think i m a slut 
it s not true 
those girls always dance
on their tiptoes 
they annoy me 
you re jealous 
maybe 
all that long day sitting at her mirror 
she was combing her golden hair  as if
in the midst of our tragedy 
she played a melody on a harp 
halfheartedly 
all that long day 
sitting at her mirror 
she was combing her golden hair  as if
she enjoyed tormenting her memory 
who ll take the plunge 
come on 
exams are soon 
it s hard to get into university 
who wants to try 
miss  please stand up 
what can you say
about this poem s hidden meaning 
i don t know 
we ve already discussed aragon 
were you here  physically  i mean 
just try 
answer  to be polite 
  hear she s leaving 
  to get married  right 
a guy studying math  a prick 
she s quitting 
at the same time  maybe it s better 
it means one less of us 
disaster 
i m afraid it ll just be you at the end 
think you ll last 
miss 
tell me about the poem 
he uses a lover s drama
to evoke a national one 
it s a political poem 
tell me about the recurrent imagery
in the poem 
fire  tragedy  memory 
for me  they re war references 
in 1942 
when the poem was published 
elsa triolet and aragon were communists 
so i think
they both hope
for a patriotic awakening 
perfect 
what rhetorical device consists
of repeating words for emphasis 
anaphora 
anaphora 
you are too much 
can i have some gum 
i m all out 
  brigitte  got some 
  nope 
i m so scared to flunk exams

they won t be easy 
my mind keeps wandering 
wandering where 
if i don t pass these exams 
i ll be on a tractor next year 
  you ll help us study 
  yes

do something 
you can t ask me that 
not me  not anyone 
the law is unsparing 
anyone who helps can end up in jail 
you too 
and only if you re spared the worst 
every month  a girl tests her luck
and ends up dying
in extreme pain 
you don t want to be that girl 
it s not fair 
maybe i won t carry it until term 
maybe 
anne

what care you doing 
working on conjugations 
 agire   present indicative 
ago  agis  agit 
agimus  agitis  agunt 
for me it s about the gaze 
i m talking literally  eyes  
i don t know what you mean

his gaze pierces through us 
he inspires justice  humanity in us 
sartre is more ambiguous 
not grossed out 
how can you eat that 
you have to eat 
i can t  take mine if you want it 
no thanks 
what about sartre now 
i think he s hard to figure 
and he backs the communists 
he backs stalin 
denies the mass murders 
my dad s a communist 
never killed a soul 
  excuse me

that s why i flirt 
they call me a tease 
but do i have a choice 
every night i dream of going farther 
but you pick one 
and if he s the wrong one   
then   
you end up pregnant 
no  anything but that 
it d be the end of the world 
at worst   
there are methods 
what are you talking about 
if you don t want a baby 
are you crazy 
never say that  not even as a joke 
bring home your dirty laundry 
the accusative case 
used with a direct object 
the genitive case 
to show possession 
next 
the dative case   
used with an indirect object 
and finally  the ablative case 
for attendant circumstances

last summer 
when i was back at my parents  
i had a relationship with a man 
it lasted a month 
he was much older than me 
we made love a lot 
at his place 
in the barn near my parents  
wherever 
whenever we could 
i was ashamed 
but the desire was stronger 
i didn t get pregnant 
by chance 
i was just luckier than you 
find the address you needed 
listen  brigitte s right 
let s not discuss it 
it s better 
  you won t tell her 
  all right 
i gave you cookies and applesauce

you already have a belly 
he s gotten strong 
is it still possible 
borderline  but doable 
got the money 
bleed a lot
when you lost your virginity 
i think so 
did you bleed a lot
or not a lot 
a lot 
some women use bleach 
bleach in a uterus 
and they wonder why they die 
you re lucky you found me 
not a sound  not a shout 
understand 
the walls are too thin 
  did you wash 
  yes 
lie down  your hips on the edge 
  like this 
  further down 
it s done 
now you mustn t touch a thing 
at first  you ll feel the wand 
you ll get used to it 
how long will it take 
less than 24 hours 
at first 
there ll just be a little blood 
then it ll come out 
sir 
i have something to ask you 
you can always ask 
i d like the last lectures  please 
what for 
so i can take my exams 
  you re too far behind 
  i ll catch up 
why the newfound interest 
i wasn t able to study before 
now i can 
you were ill 
the illness that strikes only women 
and turns them into housewives 
do you still wish to teach 
no 
why not 
it s not what matters most to me 
what would that be 
i want to write 
thank you 
it didn t work 
i m sorry 
so 
there s nothing to do 
maybe a second wand 
but it s a bad idea 
the body s reacting poorly 
there may be complications 
if you do it 
it s at your own risk 
  are you sure 
  yes 
what s wrong 
leave me alone 
don t say a word  okay 
okay 
are you there

miscarriage 
july 5th
i m scared 
it s time 
good luck 
we shall keep the honor 
the rest  we shall give away 
and we walk 
our eyes  indignant 
our foreheads  pale  on them  we read 
 faith  courage  drought  
the troops continue their route
heads high  raising their flag 
holy rags 
i hope these words by victor hugo
will show you the way 
dear students 
take your pens
