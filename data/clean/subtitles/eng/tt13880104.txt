im in disguise
they let us in so i made an effort
i came with those guys
were from the fire station nearby
youre a fireman
is that a problem
they say beware of fireman
my conscience is clear
dont want to dance
buy me a coke jean
sure
a coke please
those girls really adore you
theyre just spying on me
it suits them to think im a slut
its not true
those girls always dance
on their tiptoes
they annoy me
youre jealous
maybe
all that long day sitting at her mirror
she was combing her golden hair as if
in the midst of our tragedy
she played a melody on a harp
halfheartedly
all that long day
sitting at her mirror
she was combing her golden hair as if
she enjoyed tormenting her memory
wholl take the plunge
come on
exams are soon
its hard to get into university
who wants to try
miss please stand up
what can you say
about this poems hidden meaning
i dont know
weve already discussed aragon
were you here physically i mean
just try
answer to be polite
hear shes leaving
to get married right
a guy studying math a prick
shes quitting
at the same time maybe its better
it means one less of us
disaster
im afraid itll just be you at the end
think youll last
miss
tell me about the poem
he uses a lovers drama
to evoke a national one
its a political poem
tell me about the recurrent imagery
in the poem
fire tragedy memory
for me theyre war references
in 1942
when the poem was published
elsa triolet and aragon were communists
so i think
they both hope
for a patriotic awakening
perfect
what rhetorical device consists
of repeating words for emphasis
anaphora
anaphora
you are too much
can i have some gum
im all out
brigitte got some
nope
im so scared to flunk exams
me too
they wont be easy
my mind keeps wandering
wandering where

the law is unsparing
anyone who helps can end up in jail

every month a girl tests her luck
and ends up dying
in extreme pain
you dont want to be that girl
its not fair
maybe i wont carry it until term

anne

working on conjugations
agire present indicative
ago agis agit
agimus agitis agunt
for me its about the gaze

when camus looks at us
his gaze pierces through us
he inspires justice humanity in us
sartre is more ambiguous
not grossed out

itd be the end of the world
at worst
there are methods

never say that not even as a joke
bring home your dirty laundry
the accusative case
used with a direct object
the genitive case
to show possession

and finally the ablative case
for attendant circumstances

last summer
when i was back at my parents
i had a relationship with a man
it lasted a month
he was much older than me
we made love a lot
at his place
in the barn near my parents
wherever
whenever we could
i was ashamed
but the desire was stronger
i didnt get pregnant
by chance
i was just luckier than you
find the address you needed

you wont tell her
all right
i gave you cookies and applesauce
here
12 weeks
yes
the girl from the paper sent me

you already have a belly
hes gotten strong
is it still possible
borderline but doable
got the money
bleed a lot
when you lost your virginity
i think so
did you bleed a lot
or not a lot
a lot
some women use bleach
bleach in a uterus
and they wonder why they die
youre lucky you found me
not a sound not a shout
understand
the walls are too thin
did you wash
yes
lie down your hips on the edge
like this
further down
its done
now you mustnt touch a thing
at first youll feel the wand
youll get used to it
how long will it take
less than 24 hours
at first
therell just be a little blood
then itll come out
sir
i have something to ask you
you can always ask
id like the last lectures please
what for
so i can take my exams
youre too far behind
ill catch up
why the newfound interest
i wasnt able to study before
now i can
you were ill
the illness that strikes only women
and turns them into housewives
do you still wish to teach
no
why not
its not what matters most to me
what would that be
i want to write
thank you
it didnt work
im sorry
so
theres nothing to do
maybe a second wand
but its a bad idea
the bodys reacting poorly
there may be complications
if you do it
its at your own risk
are you sure
yes
whats wrong
leave me alone
dont say a word okay
okay
are you there

good luck
we shall keep the honor
the rest we shall give away
and we walk
our eyes indignant
our foreheads pale on them we read
faith courage drought
the troops continue their route
heads high raising their flag
holy rags
i hope these words by victor hugo
will show you the way
dear students
take your pens
