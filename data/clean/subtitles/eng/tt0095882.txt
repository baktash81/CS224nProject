  i m okay 
  nobody asked 
he s not here 
who 
  commissioner hurst 
  of course he s not here 
it s 3 00 in the morning  that s the point 
  maybe we should have called first 
  proctor 
if i d wanted the commissioner
to watch me while i looked at his files   
   i could have come in during the day
and made an appointment 
wait a minute  you mean
we re breaking and entering illegally 
  we are breaking the law 
  no  no  no 
we are not breaking the law 
we are merely stretching it a little 
oh 
it s okay to break the law
if you have a good reason   
   like a note from your doctor
or mom or something 
we are not breaking the law 
we are stretching it 
do you get it 
  uh  not really  sir 
  i got a note in my pocket  okay 
okay  why didn t you just say that 
commissioner hurst   
 commandant eric lassard   heh 
well  there he is  heh 
for years you have kept me
from my rightful place   
   as commandant of the police academy 
you always manage to come out on top
somehow  don t you  huh 
i know that there is something in this file   
   that is going to help me
get the upper hand for a change  ah 
who s in there 
commissioner hurst 
uh   uh  yes  who s out there 
bob the janitor  sir 
oh  i understand  sir 
and i didn t see you here tonight 
  i really appreciate that  bob 
  yeah  thanks a lot  bob 
  proctor 
  yes  sir 
this is it  according to these records 
commandant eric lassard   
   reached the state s
mandatory retirement age last year 
  ha ha ha 
  proctor 
  don t you see what this means 
  no 
proctor 
this means that commandant lassard   
   should have retired
from the police academy a year ago  ah 
somehow  this information
just slipped through 
well  well  well 
i find it my duty
as a conscientious police officer   
   to see to it
that this file reaches the personnel office 
are we gonna have to
break in there too  sir 
officer katherine page 
thank you  sir 
officer carla grant 
thank you 
officer bill baker 
thank you  sir 
officer bambi brandon 
  thank you  sir 
  thank you 
officer kevin wilson 
and last  but certainly not least 
not in any way   
   officer thomas conklin 
also known as house 
congratulations 
i ll miss you  class of  88 
nice 
i ve seen a lot of graduating classes 
and let me say that
this is one of the very best of them 
clearly  commandant lassard
has outdone himself this time 
it s my privilege to announce
that commandant eric lassard   
   will be honored
as police officer of the decade   
   at this year s
national police chiefs convention   
   to be held in miami beach 
this academy owes a great debt   
   to the vision of commandant lassard   
   which makes what i have to say next
even more difficult 
it is with great sadness and regret   
   that i must announce
eric lassard s retirement   
     as commandant of this police academy 
  retirement 
commandant lassard has reached
this state s mandatory retirement age 
a qualified successor will 
of course  be chosen 
but the new commandant
will have no easy task filling these shoes 
  what are we going to do 
  kick some butt 
  it s just not right 
  this is so unfair 
  i ve never seen him like this 
  he was always so strong 
  the academy was his strength 
  now he s lost it 
it s just not right 
  why don t we just shoot somebody 
  ha ha ha 
commandant 
ah  ah  ah 
  no  he ain t worth it 
  congratulations on your retirement 
i m sorry  i mean on your award
in miami beach 
concerning your retirement  sir   
   i want you to know how much i ve enjoyed
working with you all these years   
   and how much i hope you enjoy   
   your long overdue rest 
well  i guess i ll run along
and read my book 
keep in touch  everyone 
they just keep staring at each other 
we ve got to do something 
i know how you feel  sir 
i was ready to toss in the towel too 
but then i met a man who changed my life 
that man was you  sir 
he said   take what you have 
however little   
   and do your best with it  
 never quit  never lose hope  
that s the lassard i knew 
and where is that lassard now 
right here 
by god  you re right 
i was feeling sorry for myself  no more 
i m still being honored   
   at the national police chiefs convention
in miami beach 
  affirmative  sir 
  go there with my head held high 
  yes  sir 
  it will be my finest hour 
  duck 
  get down 
that s the spirit  sir 
good shot 
it would make my crowning moment
only greater   
   if my loyal graduates could be there
to share it with me 
miami beach  all that surf  sun and fun 
then you can meet nick  my nephew 
he s a policeman in miami beach 
we ll do it  sir  but only for you 
you have all given me new hope 
  way to go  sir 
  we re so proud of you 
if i cannot stay  then i ll go out in style

  i don t mean to bother you  sir 
   here at the academy 
harris  you may well be the best man
for this position 
you may even wind up
as commandant of this academy 
but you sure have a lot to learn
about acting like a commandant 
at least lassard has the respect of his men 
whose respect do you have 
  commissioner shouldn t have said that 
  he s right  proctor 
i know  sir  but   aah 
he still   he still shouldn t say it

do you mind 
some of us are trying
to plan our escape here 
  sorry  boss 
  so we are definitely gonna need   
     a boat at the harbor 
  and 
and we re definitely gonna need
a fast car   
     at the hotel back entrance 
  uh uh 
what  what 
with the roof so accessible 
you d be a fool not to ask for a helicopter 
pssh  ha  helicopter  what a stupid idea 
no  he s right 
we d be a sitting duck in that car 
the chopper is a great idea 
  so we take the chopper to the harbor  
  then 
  then we switch to the boat 
  uh uh 
what  you don t like the boat  what 
  what 
  what 
i have to go to the little boys  room 
no  this is a kidnapping 
it s not a kindergarten 
boss  he did think of the helicopter 
yeah  come on  boss  huh 
all right  fine 
but make it quick 
got a phone call to make here 
all right 
come on  all right  all right  ah 
all we can do now
is wait until we hear their demands 
i m afraid you re right 
all we can do now is wait 
would someone please wake harris up 
he s thinking 
here we go  come on  open up 
big  aah   big  aah  
tackleberry 
would you please stop doing that 
sorry  sir 
incoming call for you  sir 
  hello 
  all right  listen up  listen up 
i want a helicopter with pilot
on the roof of this hotel 
and 
and i want a fast boat
waiting for me in the harbor 
  aha 
  if all goes well  i see no cops   
   i hand the old man back to you
at the 12 mile mark off key west   
   as soon as we re safe
in international waters 
we want some proof
that lassard is still alive 
  ah  your buddies want to talk to you 
  oh  heh 
  hello 
  commandant lassard

to rescue me 
heh  it ll only make the whole thing
all the more exciting 
don t worry  uncle eric 
we ll get you out of this 
all right  he s alive 
how long depends on you 
i think  in his own way 
lassard is telling us   
   that he d rather risk his own life
than let those animals get away 
brave man 
sir  i realize that
this is your jurisdiction   
   but if there s gonna be a rescue attempt 
we d like to volunteer 
  yeah 
  yeah 
commissioner murdock 
i couldn t agree more 
i think it is vital that the rescue team
know commandant lassard intimately 
i can vouch for the skill
of these police officers 
after all  i trained them myself 
must be the drugs 
all right  now this is the floor
where lassard is being held hostage

oh 
well  in that case   
nothing personal  just business 
after capturing
the mal ankh ee diamond thieves   
   and bringing them to justice   
   these officers have been cited
for medals of honor   
   by the city of miami 
in addition  one officer selflessly   
   and at the risk of his life   
   saved captain harris from certain death 
he is sergeant moses hightower 
let them have their little moment 
we know who will have the last laugh 
uh  yes  we do  commandant harris 
for his remarkable record   
   this department is proud
to promote sergeant hightower   
   to lieutenant hightower 
i think it is fitting
that lieutenant hightower   
   receive his bars from the very officer
whose life he saved 
captain harris 
you dork 
congratulations  lieutenant hightower 
it has been a great  great pleasure   
   serving you as commandant
of this academy 
i ll miss you all  farewell 
godspeed and thank you 
nothing could please me more
than what i am about to say 
the governor and i
wish that eric lassard   
   continue as commandant
