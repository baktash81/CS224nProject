mom
yeah
do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter
sure i do
itll be lots of fun
yeah i guess so
anyway theres hardly anybody
to play with around here
i know it always takes
a little time to make new friends
yeah i guess so
what about tony
hes looking forward
to the hotel i bet
no i aint mrs torrance
now come on tony
dont be silly
i dont want to go there
how come you dont want to go
i just dont
lets just wait and see
were all going to have
a real good time
bill id like you
to meet jack torrance
how do you do bill
nice to meet you
pleasure to meet you
grab a chair bill join in
jack is going to take care of
the overlook for us this winter
id like you to take him around
soon as were through
fine
jack is a schoolteacher
formerly a schoolteacher
what line of work are you in now
im a writer
teachings been more or less
a way of making ends meet
this ought to be
quite a change for you
im looking for a change
our people in denver recommended
jack very highly and for once
l agree with them
lets see where were we
i was about to explain
that our season here runs from
may 1 5th to october 30th
then we close down completely
until the following may
do you mind if i ask
why you do that
it seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic
it would be the problem is
the enormous cost
it would be to keep
the road to sidewinder open
its a 25mile stretch of road
it gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter
theres just no way to make it
economically feasible
to keep it clear
when the place was built in 1907
there was very little interest
in winter sports
this site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty
its certainly got
plenty of that
thats right
did they give you
any idea in denver
about what the job entails
only in a very general way
the winters can be
fantastically cruel
the basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage
and depreciation
which can occur
this consists mainly
of running the boiler
heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis
repairing damage as it occurs
and doing repairs so the
elements cant get a foothold
that sounds fine to me
physically its not
a very demanding job
the only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter
is a tremendous sense
of isolation
that just happens to be
exactly what im looking for
im outlining a new
writing project
five months of peace
is just what i want
thats very good jack
because for some people
solitude
and isolation
can of itself become a problem
not for me
how about your wife and son
do you think theyll take to it
theyll love it
great
before i turn you over to bill
theres one other thing i think
we should talk about
not to sound melodramatic
but its been known to
give a few people
second thoughts about the job
im intrigued
i dont suppose they
said anything in denver
about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970
i dont believe they did
my predecessor in this job
hired a man named charles grady
as the winter caretaker
he came up with his wife and
2 little girls of about 8 and 10
he had a good employment record
good references
and from what ive been told
he seemed
like a completely
normal individual
but at some point
during the winter
he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown
he ran amuck
and killed his family
with an ax
stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing and then
he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth
the police thought
that it was what the oldtimers
used to call cabin fever
a kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur
when people are shut in together
over long periods of time
that is
quite a story
yeah it is
its still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here
but it did
i think you can appreciate
why i wanted to tell you about it
i certainly can
i also understand
why your people in denver
left it for you to tell me
obviously some people
can be put off
from staying in a place where
something like that happened
you can rest assured thats not
going to happen with me
and as far as my wife
is concerned
im sure shell be absolutely
fascinated when i tell her
shes a confirmed ghost story
and horror film addict
tony do you think
dadll get the job
he already did
he s going to phone wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her
hi babe
hi hon hows it going
great im at the hotel and
i still have a lot to go through
i dont think i can get home
before 900 or 1000
sounds like you got the job
right its a beautiful place
you and danny are going to love it
tony why dont you want to go
to the hotel
i dont know
you do too know
now come on tell me
i dont want to
please
no
now tony tell me
now hold your eyes still
so i can see
thats good now the other one
good boy
now danny
when you were brushing
your teeth
do you remember if you
smelled anything funny
or saw any bright flashing
lights or anything at all strange
no
do you remember when you were
brushing your teeth
yes
whats the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth
my mom was saying wake up
wake up danny wake up
can you remember
what you were doing
just before you started
brushing your teeth
talking to tony
is tony one of your animals
no hes a little boy
that lives in my mouth
tonys his imaginary friend
if you were to open your mouth now
could i see tony
why not
because he hides
where does he go
to my stomach
does tony ever tell you
to do things
i dont want to talk
about tony anymore
thats fine
all right danny
im going to ask you
to do me a favor
and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day okay
do i have to
yes id like you to
were going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk
ill come back and check on you
shall we go into the living room
yes
please
thank you
mrs torrance i dont think
you have anything to worry about
im quite sure theres nothing
physically wrong with danny
he seems absolutely fine now
but you shouldve seen him
i know
kids can scare you to death
but believe me these episodes
are not at all uncommon
and they look much worse
than they are
but what was the matter with him
most of the time these episodes
with kids are never explained
theyre brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again
theyre more akin
to autohypnosis
a kind of selfinduced trance
if it reoccurs which i doubt
we can always think about
having some tests done
im sure youre right
have you been in boulder long
only about three months
were from vermont my husband
was teaching school there
did the appearance
of dannys imaginary friend
tony
did tonys first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here
lets see
i guess danny started
talking to tony
about the time we put him
in nursery school
did he adjust well to school
he didnt like it too much
at first
then he had an injury so we kept
him out for a while and
i guess thats about when i first
noticed he was talking to tony
what sort of injury did he have
he dislocated his shoulder
how did he manage to do that
it was just one of
those things you know
purely an accident
my husband had been drinking
and he came home
about three hours late
so he wasnt exactly
in the greatest mood that night
and danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room
and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them
its just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child
you know in a park
or in the street
but on this particular occasion
my husband just used
too much strength
and he injured dannys arm
anyway something good did come out
of it all because he said
wendy im never going to
touch another drop
and if i do you can leave me
and he didnt
he hasnt had any
alcohol in 5 months
we must really be high up
the air feels so different
dad
im hungry
you shouldve eaten your breakfast
well get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel
okay mom
wasnt it around here that
the donner party got snowbound
i think that was farther west
in the sierras
what was the donner party
they were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times
they got snowbound one winter
in the mountains
they had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive
you mean they ate each other up
they had to in order to survive
jack
dont worry mom
i know all about cannibalism
i saw it on tv
see its okay
he saw it all on the television
what time does the plane leave
that gives us plenty of time
to go over everything
goodbye mr ullman
bye
good morning i hope you
havent been waiting too long
no problem we had time
to grab a bite to eat
good glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen
is your family
having a look around
no my sons
discovered the games room
has your luggage been brought in
right there
in view of all we have
to cover today
l suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started
have the torrances things
brought to their apartment
id better collect my family first
this is our colorado lounge
its beautiful
my god
this place is fantastic
isnt it hon
it sure is
ive never seen anything
like this before
are all these
indian designs authentic
i believe theyre based
mainly on navajo and apache motifs
theyre really gorgeous
as a matter of fact
this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel ive ever seen
this old place has had
an illustrious past
in its heyday it was a stopping
place for the jet setters
even before anybody knew
what a jet set was
we had four presidents
who stayed here
lots of movie stars
royalty
all the best people
this is the staff wing
of the hotel
none of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter
goodbye mr ullman
goodbye girls
and here are your quarters
living room bedroom bathroom
and a small bedroom for your son
perfect for a child
well then place is
very nicely selfcontained
easy to keep
cozy
yes very cozy for a family
if you feel like spreading out
you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in
well its very
homey
this is our famous hedge maze
its quite an attraction here
the walls are 13 feet high
and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself
a lot of fun but i wouldnt
want to go in there
unless i had an hour
to spare to find my way out
when was the overlook built
construction started in 1907
it was finished in 1909
the sites supposed to be
on an indian burial ground
they actually had to repel
a few indian attacks as they
were building it
thats our snowcat
can you both drive a car
thats fine basically the snowcat
operates very much like a car
it wont take you long
to get the hang of it
as a matter of fact we brought
a decorator in from chicago
just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel
he sure did a beautiful job
pink and gold
are my favorite colors
this is our gold ballroom
ill say
we can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably
boy we could really have
a good party in this room
im afraid you wont do too well
here unless you brought supplies
we remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down
that reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry
we dont drink
then youre in luck
dick come on over and say hello
to mr and mrs torrance
this is dick hallorann
our head chef
mr hallorann im jack
this is my wife winifred

ill have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time i come in
dont let it get you down
its big but it aint
nothing but a kitchen
a lot of this stuff
youll never have to touch
i wouldnt know
what to do with it if i did
one thing for sure you dont
have to worry about food
you folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice
right here is
our walkin freezer
this is where we keep
all of our meat
you got 15 rib roasts
30 tenpound bags of hamburger
we got 1 2 turkeys
about 40 chickens
50 sirloin steaks
two dozen of pork roast
and 20 legs of lamb
do you like lamb doc
you dont
whats your favorite food then
french fries and ketchup
i think we can
manage that too doc
come along now
watch your step
howd you know we call him doc
beg your pardon
doc you called danny doc twice
i did
we call him doc sometimes
like in the bugs bunny cartoons
but how did you know
i guess i probably
heard you call him that
its possible
but i honestly dont remember
calling him that
since weve been with you
anyway he looks
like a doc doesnt he
whats up doc
now this is the storeroom
in here is where we keep
all the dried goods
and the canned goods
we got canned fruits
and vegetables
canned fish and meats
hot and cold cereals
post toasties corn flakes
sugar puffs
rice krispies oatmeal
wheatena and cream of wheat
you got a dozen jugs
of black molasses
we got 60 boxes of dried milk
howd you like some ice cream doc
sociables finger rolls
and 7 kinds of what have you
now weve got dried peaches
dried apricots
dried raisins and dried prunes
you know you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy

fine
can we borrow mrs torrance
were on our way to the basement
i promise we wont
keep her very long
no problem mr ullman i was just
getting to the ice cream
you like ice cream doc
i thought you did
you folks mind if i give danny
some ice cream while we wait
not at all
we dont mind
good
sound good to you doc
okay you behave yourself
what kind of ice cream
do you like
chocolate
chocolate it shall be
come on son
its amazing all this
activity today
the guests and some staff
left yesterday but the
last days always hectic
everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible
by 500 tonight youll never
know anybody was ever here
just like a ghost ship huh
do you know how i knew
your name was doc
you know what im
talking about dont you
i can remember when i was
a little boy
my grandmother and i
could hold conversations
entirely without ever
opening our mouths
she called it shining
and for a long time i thought
it was just the two of us
that had the shine to us
just like you probably thought
you was the only one
but there are other folks
though mostly they dont
know it or dont believe it
how long have you
been able to do it
why dont you want
to talk about it
im not supposed to
who says you aint supposed to
tony
whos tony
tonys the little boy
that lives in my mouth
is tony the one
that
tells you things
how does he tell you things
its like i go to sleep
and he shows me things
but when i wake up
i cant remember everything
does your mom and dad
know about tony
do they know he tells you things
tony told me never to tell them
has tony ever told you
anything about this place
about the overlook hotel
i dont know
now think real hard doc
think
maybe he showed me something
try to think of what it was
mr hallorann are you scared
of this place
scared of nothing here
its just that
you know some places
are like people
some shine
and some dont
i guess you could say
the overlook hotel
has something about it
thats like shining
is there something bad here
you know doc
when something happens
it can leave a trace
of itself behind
say like
if someone burns toast
maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind
not things that anyone
can notice
but things that people
who shine can see
just like they can see things
that havent happened yet
sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago
i think a lot of things
happened right here
in this particular hotel
over the years
and not all of them
was good
what about room 237
room 237
youre scared of room 237
aint you
no i aint
mr hallorann what is in room 237
nothing
there aint nothing in room 237
but you aint got no business
going in there anyway
so stay out
you understand stay out
good morning hon
your breakfast is ready
what time is it
its about 1130
jesus
i guess weve been
staying up too late
i know it
i made them just the way

how about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast
i suppose i ought to try
to do some writing first

the habit of writing every day
thats all it is
its really nice up here

i love it
i really do
ive never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere
its amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place
i tell you when we first

l thought it was kind of scary
i fell in love with it right away
when i came up here
for my interview
it was as though
id been here before
i mean we all have moments
of déjà vu
but this was ridiculous
it was almost as though i knew
what was going to be
around every corner
