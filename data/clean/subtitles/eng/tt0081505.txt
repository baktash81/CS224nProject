yeah 
do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter 
sure i do 
it ll be lots of fun 
yeah  i guess so 
anyway  there s hardly anybody
to play with around here 
i know  it always takes
a little time to make new friends 
yeah  i guess so 
what about tony 
he s looking forward
to the hotel  i bet 
no  i ain t  mrs  torrance 
now  come on  tony 
don t be silly 
i don t want to go there 
how come you don t want to go 
i just don t 
let s just wait and see 
we re all going to have
a real good time 
bill  i d like you
to meet jack torrance 
how do you do  bill 
 nice to meet you 
 pleasure to meet you 
grab a chair  bill  join in 
jack is going to take care of
the overlook for us this winter 
i d like you to take him around
soon as we re through 
fine 
jack is a schoolteacher 
formerly a schoolteacher 
what line of work are you in now 
i m a writer 
teaching s been more or less
a way of making ends meet 
this ought to be
quite a change for you 
i m looking for a change 
our people in denver recommended
jack very highly  and for once   
   l agree with them 
let s see  where were we 
i was about to explain   
   that our season here runs from
may 1 5th to october 30th 
then we close down completely
until the following may 
do you mind if i ask
why you do that 
it seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic 
it would be  the problem is
the enormous cost   
   it would be to keep
the road to sidewinder open 
it s a 25 mile stretch of road 
it gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter 
there s just no way to make it
economically feasible   
   to keep it clear 
when the place was built in 1907   
   there was very little interest
in winter sports 
this site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty 
it s certainly got
plenty of that 
that s right 
did they give you
any idea in denver   
   about what the job entails 
only in a very general way 
the winters can be
fantastically cruel 
the basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage   
   and depreciation
which can occur 
this consists mainly
of running the boiler   
   heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis   
   repairing damage as it occurs   
   and doing repairs so the
elements can t get a foothold 
that sounds fine to me 
physically  it s not
a very demanding job 
the only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter   
   is a tremendous sense
of isolation 
that just happens to be
exactly what i m looking for 
i m outlining a new
writing project 
five months of peace
is just what i want 
that s very good  jack 
because  for some people   
   solitude   
   and isolation   
   can  of itself  become a problem 
not for me 
how about your wife and son 
do you think they ll take to it 
they ll love it 
great 
before i turn you over to bill   
   there s one other thing i think
we should talk about 
not to sound melodramatic   
   but it s been known to
give a few people   
   second thoughts about the job 
i m intrigued 
i don t suppose they
said anything in denver   
   about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970 
i don t believe they did 
my predecessor in this job   
   hired a man named charles grady
as the winter caretaker 
he came up with his wife and
2 little girls of about 8 and 10 
he had a good employment record 
good references 
and from what i ve been told 
he seemed   
   like a completely
normal individual 
but at some point
during the winter   
   he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown 
he ran amuck   
   and killed his family
with an ax 
stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing  and then   
   he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth 
the police thought   
   that it was what the old timers
used to call cabin fever 
a kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur   
   when people are shut in together
over long periods of time 
that is   
   quite a story 
yeah  it is 
it s still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here 
but it did 
i think you can appreciate
why i wanted to tell you about it 
i certainly can 
i also understand
why your people in denver   
   left it for you to tell me 
obviously  some people
can be put off   
   from staying in a place where
something like that happened 
you can rest assured that s not
going to happen with me 
and as far as my wife
is concerned   
   i m sure she ll be absolutely
fascinated when i tell her 
she s a confirmed ghost story   
   and horror film addict 
tony  do you think
dad ll get the job 
he already did 
he  s going to phone wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her 
 hi  babe 
 hi  hon  how s it going 
great  i m at the hotel and
i still have a lot to go through 
i don t think i can get home
before 9 00 or 10 00 
sounds like you got the job 
right  it s a beautiful place 
you and danny are going to love it 
tony  why don t you want to go
to the hotel 
i don t know 
you do too know 
now come on  tell me 
i don t want to 
please 
no 
now  tony  tell me 
now  hold your eyes still
so i can see 
that s good  now the other one 
good boy 
now  danny   
   when you were brushing
your teeth   
   do you remember if you
smelled anything funny   
   or saw any bright  flashing
lights or anything at all strange 
no 
do you remember when you were
brushing your teeth 
yes 
what s the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth 
my mom was saying   wake up 
wake up  danny  wake up  
can you remember
what you were doing   
   just before you started
brushing your teeth 
talking to tony 
is tony one of your animals 
no  he s a little boy
that lives in my mouth 
tony s his imaginary friend 
if you were to open your mouth now 
could i see tony 
why not 
because he hides 
where does he go 
to my stomach 
does tony ever tell you
to do things 
i don t want to talk
about tony anymore 
that s fine 
all right  danny 
i m going to ask you
to do me a favor   
   and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day  okay 
do i have to 
yes  i d like you to 
we re going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk 
i ll come back and check on you 
 shall we go into the living room 
 yes 
 please 
 thank you 
mrs  torrance  i don t think
you have anything to worry about 
i m quite sure there s nothing
physically wrong with danny 
he seems absolutely fine now 
but you should ve seen him 
i know 
kids can scare you to death 
but believe me  these episodes
are not at all uncommon 
and they look much worse
than they are 
but what was the matter with him 
most of the time  these episodes
with kids are never explained 
they re brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again 
they re more akin
to autohypnosis   
   a kind of self induced trance 
if it reoccurs  which i doubt   
   we can always think about
having some tests done 
i m sure you re right 
have you been in boulder long 
only about three months 
we re from vermont  my husband
was teaching school there 
did the appearance
of danny s imaginary friend    
tony 
did tony s first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here 
let s see    
i guess danny started
talking to tony   
   about the time we put him
in nursery school 
did he adjust well to school 
he didn t like it too much
at first 
then he had an injury  so we kept
him out for a while and    
i guess that s about when i first
noticed he was talking to tony 
what sort of injury did he have 
he dislocated his shoulder 
how did he manage to do that 
it was just one of
those things  you know 
purely an accident 
my husband had been drinking   
   and he came home
about three hours late 
so he wasn t exactly
in the greatest mood that night 
and danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room   
   and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them 
it s just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child   
   you know  in a park
or in the street 
but on this particular occasion   
   my husband just used
too much strength   
   and he injured danny s arm 
anyway  something good did come out
of it all because he said   
    wendy  i m never going to
touch another drop 
and if i do  you can leave me  
and he didn t 
he hasn t had any
alcohol in 5 months 
we must really be high up 
the air feels so different 
dad 
i m hungry 
you should ve eaten your breakfast 
we ll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel 
okay  mom 
wasn t it around here that
the donner party got snowbound 
i think that was farther west 
in the sierras 
what was the donner party 
they were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times 
they got snowbound one winter
in the mountains 
they had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive 
you mean they ate each other up 
they had to in order to survive 
jack 
don t worry  mom 
i know all about cannibalism 
i saw it on tv 
see  it s okay 
he saw it all on the television 
 what time does the plane leave 
 8 30 
that gives us plenty of time
to go over everything 
 goodbye  mr  ullman 
 bye 
good morning  i hope you
haven t been waiting too long 
no problem  we had time
to grab a bite to eat 
good  glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen 
is your family
having a look around 
no  my son s
discovered the games room 
 has your luggage been brought in 
 right there 
in view of all we have
to cover today   
   l suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started 
have the torrances  things
brought to their apartment 
i d better collect my family first 
this is our colorado lounge 
it s beautiful 
my god 
this place is fantastic 
isn t it  hon 
it sure is 
i ve never seen anything
like this before 
are all these
indian designs authentic 
i believe they re based   
   mainly on navajo and apache motifs 
they re really gorgeous 
as a matter of fact   
   this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel i ve ever seen 
this old place has had
an illustrious past 
in its heyday  it was a stopping
place for the jet setters   
   even before anybody knew
what a jet set was 
we had four presidents
who stayed here 
lots of movie stars 
royalty 
all the best people 
this is the staff wing
of the hotel 
none of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter 
 goodbye  mr  ullman 
 goodbye  girls 
and here are your quarters 
living room  bedroom  bathroom 
and a small bedroom for your son 
perfect for a child 
well  then  place is
very nicely self contained 
easy to keep 
cozy 
yes  very cozy for a family 
if you feel like spreading out   
   you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in 
well  it s very   
   homey 
this is our famous hedge maze 
it s quite an attraction here 
the walls are 13 feet high   
   and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself 
a lot of fun  but i wouldn t
want to go in there   
   unless i had an hour
to spare to find my way out 
when was the overlook built 
construction started in 1907 
it was finished in 1909 
the site s supposed to be
on an indian burial ground 
they actually had to repel   
   a few indian attacks as they
were building it 
that s our snowcat 
can you both drive a car 
that s fine  basically the snowcat
operates very much like a car 
it won t take you long
to get the hang of it 
as a matter of fact  we brought
a decorator in from chicago   
   just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel 
he sure did a beautiful job 
pink and gold
are my favorite colors 
this is our gold ballroom 
i ll say 
we can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably 
boy  we could really have
a good party in this room 
i m afraid you won t do too well
here unless you brought supplies 
we remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down 
that reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry 
we don t drink 
then you re in luck 
dick  come on over and say hello
to mr  and mrs  torrance 
this is dick hallorann 
our head chef 
mr  hallorann  i m jack 
this is my wife  winifred 
glad to meet you 
the torrances will take care
of the overlook this winter 
that s just great  how do you
folks like our hotel so far 
it s just wonderful 
hi  danny 
i found him outside
looking for you 
did you get tired
of bombing the universe 
come on over here 
thank you  susie 
i think it d be good if you could
show mrs  torrance the kitchen   
   while i continue on with jack 
it would be a pleasure 
right this way 
great  see you later  hon 
bye  darling 
mrs  torrance  your husband
introduced you as winifred 
now  are you a  winnie  
or a  freddie  
i m a wendy 
wendy  that s nice 
that s the prettiest 
this is the kitchen  huh 
this is it 
how do you like it  danny 
is it big enough for you 
it s the biggest place i ever seen 
this whole place
is such an enormous maze 
i ll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time i come in 
don t let it get you down 
it s big  but it ain t
nothing but a kitchen 
a lot of this stuff
you ll never have to touch 
i wouldn t know
what to do with it if i did 
one thing for sure  you don t
have to worry about food 
you folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice 
right here is
our walk in freezer 
this is where we keep
all of our meat 
you got 15 rib roasts   
   30 ten pound bags of hamburger 
we got 1 2 turkeys 
about 40 chickens   
   50 sirloin steaks 
two dozen of pork roast   
   and 20 legs of lamb 
do you like lamb  doc 
you don t 
what s your favorite food  then 
french fries and ketchup 
i think we can
manage that too  doc 
come along  now 
watch your step 
how d you know we call him doc 
 beg your pardon 
 doc  you called danny  doc  twice 
i did 
we call him doc sometimes 
like in the bugs bunny cartoons 
but how did you know 
i guess i probably
heard you call him that 
it s possible 
but i honestly don t remember   
   calling him that
since we ve been with you 
anyway  he looks
like a doc  doesn t he 
what s up  doc 
now  this is the storeroom 
in here is where we keep   
   all the dried goods
and the canned goods 
we got canned fruits
and vegetables   
   canned fish and meats 
hot and cold cereals 
post toasties  corn flakes 
sugar puffs   
   rice krispies  oatmeal 
wheatena and cream of wheat 
you got a dozen jugs
of black molasses 
we got 60 boxes of dried milk   
how d you like some ice cream  doc 
sociables  finger rolls   
   and 7 kinds of what have you 
now  we ve got dried peaches 
dried apricots   
   dried raisins and dried prunes 
you know  you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy 
 how re you getting on 
 fine 
can we borrow mrs  torrance 
we re on our way to the basement 
i promise we won t
keep her very long 
no problem  mr  ullman  i was just
getting to the ice cream 
you like ice cream  doc 
i thought you did 
you folks mind if i give danny
some ice cream while we wait 
 not at all 
 we don t mind 
 good 
 sound good to you  doc 
okay  you behave yourself 
what kind of ice cream
do you like 
chocolate 
chocolate it shall be 
come on  son 
it s amazing  all this
activity today 
the guests and some staff
left yesterday  but the   
   last day s always hectic 
everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible 
by 5 00 tonight  you ll never
know anybody was ever here 
just like a ghost ship  huh 
do you know how i knew
your name was doc 
you know what i m
talking about  don t you 
i can remember when i was
a little boy   
   my grandmother and i
could hold conversations   
   entirely without ever
opening our mouths 
she called it  shining  
and for a long time i thought
it was just the two of us   
   that had  the shine  to us 
just like you probably thought
you was the only one 
but there are other folks   
   though mostly they don t
know it  or don t believe it 
how long have you
been able to do it 
why don t you want
to talk about it 
i m not supposed to 
who says you ain t supposed to 
tony 
who s tony 
tony s the little boy
that lives in my mouth 
is tony the one
that   
   tells you things 
how does he tell you things 
it s like i go to sleep 
and he shows me things 
but when i wake up 
i can t remember everything 
does your mom and dad
know about tony 
do they know he tells you things 
tony told me never to tell them 
has tony ever told you
anything about this place 
about the overlook hotel 
i don t know 
now think real hard  doc 
think 
maybe he showed me something 
try to think of what it was 
mr  hallorann  are you scared
of this place 
scared of nothing here 
it s just that   
   you know  some places
are like people 
some shine   
   and some don t 
i guess you could say
the overlook hotel   
   has something about it
that s like shining 
is there something bad here 
you know  doc 
when something happens   
   it can leave a trace
of itself behind 
say  like   
   if someone burns toast 
maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind 
not things that anyone
can notice 
but things that people
who shine can see 
just like they can see things
that haven t happened yet   
   sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago 
i think a lot of things
happened right here   
   in this particular hotel
over the years 
and not all of them
was good 
what about room 237 
room 237 
you re scared of room 237 
ain t you 
no  i ain t 
mr  hallorann  what is in room 237 
nothing 
there ain t nothing in room 237 
but you ain t got no business
going in there anyway 
so stay out 
you understand  stay out 
good morning  hon 
your breakfast is ready 
what time is it 
it s about 11 30 
jesus 
i guess we ve been
staying up too late 
i know it 
i made them just the way
you like them  sunny side up 
nice 
it s really pretty outside 
how about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast 
i suppose i ought to try
to do some writing first 
any ideas yet 
lots of ideas 
no good ones 
something will come 
it s just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day 
that s all it is 
it s really nice up here 
isn t it 
i love it 
i really do 
i ve never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere 
it s amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place 
i tell you  when we first
came up here   
   l thought it was kind of scary 
i fell in love with it right away 
when i came up here
for my interview   
   it was as though
i d been here before 
i mean  we all have moments
of déjà vu   
   but this was ridiculous 
it was almost as though i knew   
   what was going to be
around every corner 
the loser has to keep
america clean  how s that 
 all right 
 and you re going to lose 
and i m going to get you 
you d better run fast 
look out 
i m coming in close 
loser has to keep america clean

of this walking 
give me your hand

i didn t think it was
going to be this big  did you 
rutherford was serving
a life sentence   
   for a 1968 shooting 
and the search continues
for that missing aspen woman 
24 year old susan robertson

she disappeared on a hunting
trip with her husband 
they may have to
call off the search   
   if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow 
it s so beautiful
in denver today   
   it s hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close 
i want to go outside

on his goddamn little head 
i love the little
son of a bitch 
i d do anything for him 
any fucking thing for him 
but that bitch 
as long as i live   
   she ll never let me forget
what happened 
i did hurt him once  okay 
it was an accident 
completely unintentional 
it could have happened
to anybody 
and it was three goddamn
years ago 
the little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor 
all i tried to do was pull him up 
a momentary loss of
muscular coordination 
i mean   
   a few extra foot pounds
of energy   
   per second  per second 
thank god you re here 
there s someone else
in the hotel with us 
there s a crazy woman
in one of the rooms 
she tried to strangle danny 
are you out of your fucking mind 
it s the truth  really 
i swear it 
danny told me 
he went up into
one of the bedrooms 
the door was open  and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub 
she tried to strangle him
