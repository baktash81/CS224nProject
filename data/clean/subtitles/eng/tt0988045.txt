let me show you how much
ive enjoyed it
watson dont
observe
how did you see that
because i was looking for it
lord blackwood

attention more than he
indeed
oh id leave that alone
if i were you boyo
good lad
impeccable timing
lestrade
weve one for the doctor
and one for the rope
clarky
sir
this woman needs
a hospital immediately
put her in the back of the maria
right lads thats it
pick him up lads
if you dont mind
get him out of my sight
and you were supposed
to wait for my orders
if i had youd be
cleaning up a corpse
and chasing a rumor
besides the girls parents
hired me not the yard
why they thought you would
require any assistance is beyond me
well london will breathe a sigh of relief
indeed

could you have a longer engagement
i smell gunpowder this is not right you know
not in a domestic environment
thank you captain phillip
perhaps a nice
cup of tea
same time next week
come along captain
its quiet downstairs
mrs hudson
bring something to cheer him up
permission to enter
the armory
granted
watson i am in the process
of inventing a device
that supresses the sound
of a gunshot
its not working
can i see that
you know its been three months
since your last case
gently gently watson
be gentle with me
i do think its time
you found another one
i cant but agree
my mind embellishes technician
giving me problems giving me work
the sooner the better
paper
lets see that
theres a letter here
mrs ramsey of queens park
her husbands disappeared
hes in belgium with the scullery maid
is it november
yes holmes
what
lady radford reports
oh her emerald bracelet
has disappeared
it is an insurance swindle
lord radford likes fast women
and slow ponies
i see you are the attending physician
at blackwoods hanging
yes
it was our last case together
and i wanted to see it through to the end
a mr louis
im thinking of one case
that intrigues me at present
the curious case of mrs hudson
the absentee landlady
ive been studying her comings and goings
and they appear to be mostsinister
tea mr holmes
is it poisoned nanny
theres enough of that in you already
dont touch
everything is in its proper place
as usual nanny
oop hes killed the dog
again
what have you done to gladstone
now
i was simply testing
a new anesthetic
he doesnt mind
holmes
as your doctor
hell be straight as a trivet in no time
as your friend
youve been in this room for two weeks
i insist you have to get out
there is nothing of interest
for me out there on earth
at all
so youre free this evening
absolutely
dinner
wonderful
the royale
my favorite
marys coming
not available
youre meeting her holmes
have you proposed yet
no i havent found the right ring
so its official
its happening whether
yo like it or not
830 the royale
wear a jacket
you wear a jacket
holmes
hmm
youre early
fashionably
miss mary morsten
ahh my goodness what a pleasure
for the life of me i dont know why it has taken
so long for him to intoduce us properly
the pleasure is mine
its really is quite a thrill to
meet you mr holmes
ive heard so much about you
i have a pile of detective novels
at home of collins poe
its true
it can seem a little farfetched
though at some times
making these grand assumptions
out of such tiny details
thats not quite right is it
in fact the little details
are by far the most important
take watson
i intend to
see his walking stick over there
african snakewood
hiding a blade of high tensile steel
a few were rewarded to veterans
of the afghan war
so i can assume he is
a decorated soldier
strong brave brave
born to be an adventurer
and neat
as all military men
now i check his pockets
ahh a stub from a boxing match
now i can infer that
hes a bit of a gambler
i d keep an eye on that dowry
if i were you
those days are behind me
right behind you
its cost us the rent
more than once
well with all due respect mr holmes
you know john very well
what about a complete stranger
what can you tell about me
you
i dont think thats
i dont know that thats
not at dinner
perhaps another time
i insist
you insist
do you remember we discussed this
the lady insists
you are a governess
well done
yes well done
should we  waiter
your student
its a boy of eight
charlie is seven actually
then hes tall for his age
he flicked ink at you today
is there ink on my face
there is nothing wrong with your face
there are two drops on your ear in fact
india blue is almost
impossible to wash off
anyway a very impetuous act by the boy
which you have experienced many times
which is why
the lady for whom you work
lent you that necklace
pearls diamonds flawless ruby hardly
the gems of a governess
however that jewels you are not wearing
tells us rather more
holmes
you were engaged
the ring has gone but the lightness of
the skin where it once sat suggests
you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly
that is until you were informed
of its true and rather modest worth
at which point you broke off the
engagement you returned to england
for a better prospect
a doctor perhaps
youre right on all counts
mr holmes but for one
i didnt leave him
he died
well done old boy
stand up and fight
come on
get up
thats it big man
were done
youve won congratulations
oi we aint done yet
this mustnt register
on an emotional level
first distract target
then block his blind jab
counter with cross to left cheek
discombobulate
dazed hell attempt wild haymaker
employ elbow block
and body shot
block thorough left
weaken that jaw
now fracture
break cracked ribs
traumamatize solar plexus
dislocate jaw entirely
heel kick to diaphragm
in summary ears ringing
jaw fractured three ribs
cracked four broken
diaphragm hemorrhaging
physical recovery 6 weeks
full psychological recovery 6 months
capacity to spit at back of head
neutralized
where did that come from
what the hell is going on here charley
lord blackwood put him under
some kind of spell sir
looks like hes burning
from the inside out
shut up
charley charley
take this man to the infirmary
now
whats this all about then blackwood
theres someone i want to see
watson
right
lets go
what started merely as an experiment
has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery
now if i play a chromatic scale
theres no measurable response
you do know what youre drinking
is meant for eye surgery
but  now
and this is remarkable
if i change to atonal clusters
voila
they fly in counterclockwise
synchronized concentric circles
it is a regimented flock
watson this is exceptional
i using musical theory
have created order from chaos
how do you lure them in
excellent question
individually
ive been at it for six hours
and what happens if i do this
right
clean yourself up
you are blackwoods last request
look at those towering structures
its the first combination of bascules
suspension bridge ever attempted
most innovative
what an industrious empire
oh i have your winnings from last night
you werent there
so i made your customary bet
youre right
ill keep it with your checkbook
locked safely away in my drawer
did you know that the opera house
is featuring don giovanni
i could easily have procured a couple of tickets
if you have any cultural
inclinations this evening
you have a grand gift of silence watson
that makes you quite
invaluable as a companion
i knew shed been engaged
she told me
so thats no to the opera then
that was my waistcoat
i thought we agreed that
its too small for you
i would like it back
i thought we agreed
i want it back
this way mr holmes
blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd in something of a fear frenzy
well im certain it will disperse
once his feet have stopped twirling
care to come along
no you are on your own old cock
i had no business with him
when he was alive
suit yourself mother hen
it seems that you have
lots of rooms to let
yes had to move the prisoners
sir
otherwise we would
have a riot on our hands
he has a peculiar effect
on the inmates as though
he can get inside their heads
im sure i can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform
much obliged sir
thank you sir
and i stood upon the sand of the sea
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea
having seven heads and ten horns
and upon his horns ten crowns
and upon his heads the name of blasphemy
and they worshipped the dragon
which gave power unto the beast
and they worshipped the beast saying
who is like unto the beast
the beast which i just saw
had the body of a leopard
but had feet of a bear
and the mouth was the mouth of a lion
the dragon gave his power unto the beast
and his seat and his authority
i love what youve done with the place
so glad you can accept my invitation
i have just a small point of concern
how can i help
ive already followed the murders
with some interest
and while my heart went out
primarily to the families of the victims
i can not but notice
the criminal mastery
in the stroking of your brush
you are too kind
however by comparison
your work in the crypt
was more akin to
a finger painting
so now youre curious
as to whether theres a logicum afoot
either that or
shortly my friend will
pronounce you dead
and im thought to maybe
keep you company
your mistake is to imagine
that anything earthly
led us to this moment
your error in judgment is to assume
that im holding the brush at all
im merely the channel
my only wish was that
i could have caught you sooner
five lives might
have been spared
those lives were a necessity
sacrifice
five otherwise meaningless creatures
called to serve a higher purpose
i wonder if theyd let watson
and me dissect your brain
after you hang of course
i am sure that is some deformity
that would be scientifically significant
then you too could serve
a greater purpose
holmes you must
widen  your case
im concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events
you and i are ebound together a journey that
will wist the very fabric of nature
but beneath your mask of logic
i sense a fragility
that worries me
steel your mind holmes
i need you
i say youve come a long way
down from the house of lords
i will rise again
bon voyage
pay attention
three more will die and there is nothing
you can do to save them
you must accept that this
is beyond your control
by the time you realize
you made all this possible
it will be the last sane thought
in your head
what did he want
im not sure
but i dont think youwill
need it father not for this one
lord henry blackwood
you are sentenced to death
for the practice of black magic
the unholy murder of
five innocent young women
and attempted murder of a sixth
do you have any final words
death  is only the beginning
that is the end of
lord blackwood
london is so bleak
this time of year
not that im pining for
new jersey
much prefer to travel in the winter
here i brought you these
all the way from syria
i found these exquisite dates
in jordan
and your favorite
olives from the cyclades
i thought we might have
a little tea party
and while i was setting the table
i found this
a file with my name on it
the theft of velasquez
portrait of the king of spain
and missing naval documents
lead to the resignation
of the bulgarian prime minister
scandalous affair
and engagement of
perhaps to both
romanov princes
simply studying your methods
in the event the authorities should
ask me to hunt you down
but i dont see my name in
any of these articles
but your signature was clear
is that the maharajas missing diamond
or just another souvenir
lets not dwell on the past
shall we
now by the look of things
id say you were between jobs
and you between husbands
how much did you give for the ring
he was boring jealous
and he snored
im irene adler again
thank you
i need your help
i need you to find someone
why are you always so suspicious
should i answer chronologically
or alphabetically
careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope
i think you will find all the
information you need inside
who are you working for
so ill have to find
out the hard way
keep your money
i didnt say that id take the case
well consider it a wager that you will
do you emember the grand
they gave me our old room
hold the door
thanks doctor
maam
hell do it
well done miss adler
thats precisely why
i hired you
ill wager he will have our man
within the next 24 hours
hed better
reordan is the key to what
blackwood was doing
hes essential to my plan
whats she doing
cant you see where youre going
get off out of it
a liitle will go a long way sir
rubbing these callouses off this
god save the queen
god save the queen sir
get off out of it
look at you
the only woman you ever cared about
a world class criminal
are you a masochist
allow me to explain
allow me
she is the only adversary who
ever outsmarted you  twice
made a proper idiot out of you
right youve had your fun
whats she want anyway
time to press on
what could she possibly need
it doesnt matter
a beard
a human canoe
she could sit on her back
and paddle you up the thames
this is no consequence to you
weve done our last case together
ive already read it
missing person
luke reordan
4 foot ten red hair no front teeth
case solved
you obviously do not have time
she likes ginger dwarfs
midgets
so you agree
no i dont agree
its more than a technicality
you are misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples
ive said too much
i can tell ive upset you
no im just stating that one has
what are you doing
will you allow me to explain
i wish you would
holmes what are you doing
nothing
are you wearing a false nose
a false nose no
tell me if that was
holmes where you going
watson
help watson
got some flowers for you sweetheart
cut you a deal
because youre so pretty
oh my lucky day
i got gold if you do some for me
do not move
now what have we got here
thank you
thats the irene i knew
this plan intrigues me me watson
hes got adler on edge
which is no mean feat
shes intimidated
shes scared of him
yet she works for him
right
its nothing to do with me but id advise
you to leave the case alone
well i may not have a choice hmm
after all i may be paying the rent alone
soon thanks to you
get that out of my face
its not in your face
its in my hand
get what is in your hand
out of my face
mr holmes
clarky
sir inspector lestrade asks that you
come with me at once
whats he done now
lost his way to scotland yard
watson grab a compass
you means us
no you means you
its about lord blackwood
sir he
it appears hes come
back from the grave sir
most engaging
very clever
i pronounced the man dead myself
what are the facts
groundskeeper claims he saw him walking
through the graveyard just this morning sir
ill leave this in your capable hands
i have an appointment with mary
its not my reputation thats at stake here
dont try that
have the newspapers got wind of it yet
well thats what were trying to avoid sir
certainly
whats the major concern
panic sheer bloody panic sir
indeed
youre not taking this seriously
are you holmes
yes
as you should
its a matter of
professional integrity
no girl wants to
marry a doctor who
cant tell if a man
is dead or not
who do you think won the match
clarky
sir
the rugby match
your boys have done a magnificent job
of obliterating any potential evidence
yes but at least they never
miss an opportunity
to miss an opportunity
you took the time holmes
and on the third day
these slabs were sandstone
half a ton each if theyre a pound
and theyre smashed open from the inside
lestrade what of the coffin
we are in the process of
bringing it up now
i see hmpf
right
at what stage of the process
contemplative
and how is our witness
hes over there
and apparently hes cata
cat
catatonic sir
hes not feeling very well
yes
now if you lot dont stop behaving like
a bunch of quivering milkmaids
youre on double time
now you get down there and
you bring that coffin up
now
good day sir
all right
im a doctor
the mans in shock
he may need a few moments
the witness stated that he saw
lord blackwood rising from the grave
well
well
you pronounced him dead
he had no pulse
good lord
thats not blackwood
well now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious
time of death
diptera is approximately
23 of an inch
which would put the time of death
between ten and twleve hours ago
may i borrow your pen
headless dwarf
midget
i know what i saw
it was blackwood
as clear as i see you
and when the dead walk
the living will fill these coffins
well um
right put the lid on it
and clean this lot up
you really believe he was resurrected
the question is not if but how
the games afoot
follow your spirit and upon this charge
cry god for harry england
and st george
why that certain fish and chips store
i dont understand
that particular beer they use
a northern stout to be exact
you know holmes
ive seen things in war
i dont understand
in india i once met a man
who predicted his own death
right down to the number and placement
of the bullets that killed him
you have to admit holmes
that a supernatural explanation
to this case is theoretically possible
no agreed but
it is a huge mistake to theorize
before one has data
inevitably one begins to twist facts
to suit theory
instead of theories to suit facts
that said i believe our midget
is the key to this
right scratches around the
keyhole where the watch is wound
what does that tell you
the man was likely
a drunk
every time he wound the watch
his hand would slip and hence the scratch
yes
very good watson
you have developed considerable
deductive powers of your own
lets see now there are several
sets of initials scored
pawn brokers mark
excellent
the mostb recent of which are
mh mh mh
is for
maddison and haig
they should be able to give us an address
what a coincidence
there is one thing youve failed to deduce
from the watch holmes
really i think not
the time
i have to get back holmes
taking tea with the inlaws
predicting your future sir
absolutely not
no thank you maam
you need to hear what i have to tell you
we have no need of your
lucky hela gypsy woman
even if its to do with mary
i see two men
brothers not in blood but in bond
what of mary
and from mary
for marriage oh you will be married
go on
i see patterned table cloths and
chain of figurines
lace doilies
doilies
lace doilies holmes
does your depravity know no bounds
no
oh she turns to fat and
she has a beard
and she has a big wart
what of the warts
she is covered in warts
enough
are they extensive
please enough
its a most apt prediction flora has made
and precisely the reason
you cant find a suitable ring
do you have my money
you are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre
do you have my money
admit it admit it
give me my money
holmes
i see
thank you
youve got your ring and
ive got my address for the ginger midget
should be just there
i think shell really like this
and i have some change in my pocket
shall i look after it for you
no no
dont give it away here
no
i have to go see mary
give her my best
and the family as well
it does make a considerable difference
to me having
someone with me on whom
i can thoroughly rely
well you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes
he clearly felt something
would come after him
something did
irene adler was here
either that or the ginger midget
wore the same parisian perfume
ahhh putrefaction
ammonium sulphate
among other aromas
phosphorus
formaldehyde
it looks like
he was attempting to combine
some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula
more impotantly
lets see what he was trying to dispose of
potassium magnesium
sultafitic acid
try to take the ion out of the ink
as long as its not too burnt
peculiar
hydrated rhododendron
holmes
look at the crest
reordan was working with blackwood
of course he was
the question is
to what end
whatever he was working on
he clearly succeeded
how so
otherwise hed still
be alive
which is why miss adler
is so desperate to find him
yes
theres one odor i cant
quite put my finger on
is it candy floss
molasses
maple syrup
brown sugar
toffee
apple
let me guess
judging by your arsenous tool kit
youre here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein
just one minute boys
oh dredger
there a problem
meat
or potatoes
my ten minutes are up
you all right
come
holmes
what is that
holmes
watson
what on earth have you done
i havent slept all night
not a wink
why i ever believed
that i would get to have tea
with marys parents
is beyond me having been talkind
into going with you
we could say it was in selfdefense
ive been reviewing my notes
our exploits over tha last seven months
would you like to know my conclusion
i am psychologically disturbed
how so
why else would i continually
be led into situations
where you deliberately
withhold your plans for me
why else
you never complained about
my methods before
im not complaining
youre not
what do you call this
how am i complaining
i never complain
when do i complain about yout practicing
the violin at 3 in the morning
or your mess or your
general lack of hygiene
or the fact that you steal my clothes
we have a barter system
when do i complain about you
setting fire to my rooms
our rooms
the rooms when do i complain that
you experiment on my dog
our dog
on the the dog
its our dog
what i do take issue with is your
campaign to sabotage my relationship
with mary
i understand
do you
i do
i dont think you do
youre overtired
yes
youre feeling a bit sensitive
im not sensitive
what you need is a rest
my brother mycroft
has a small estate near chichester
beautiful grounds
theres a falls
we could throw a lamb on the spit
we holmes if i were to go to the
country it would be with my future wife
well certainly if we must
not you mary and i
you are not
what invited
why would i not be invited to my
own brothers country home watson
you are not making any sense
youre not human
john watson
yes
your bail has been posted
mary
just watson
i hope you get bail by breakfast
because boys are getting hungry
back off back off
to which the barman says
may i push in your stool
not you youre out
until next time
always a pleasure mr holmes
thank heaven youre here lestrade
id almost ran out of jokes
you know in another life
youd have made an excellent criminal
yes and you sir
an excellent policeman
tomsky thank you
please tell me you have answers
all in good time lestrade
all in good time what is this some parlor game
where we have to guess what yourre thinking
ive got a public in frenzy out there
now if you dont fill me in
ill have you in there
playing victoria and albert
quicker than a bookies runner
now clean up and make yourself presentable
for whom
i have friends in high places
theyre the ones
who bailed you out of there
im terribly sorry to
inconvenience you sir
but im going to have
to put this on you
mr holmes apologies
for summoning you like this
im sure its quite a mystery as to
where you are and who i am
as to where i am
i was admittedly lost for a moment
between charing cross and holborn
but i was saved by the bread shop
on saffron hill
the only baker to use a certain
french glaze on their loaves
a brittany sage
after that the carriage fork left
and right
a telltale bump at the fleet conduit
as to who you are
it took every ounce of my not
inconsiderabile experience
the letters on your desk are
addressed to sir thomas rodrum
you are chief justice that
would be your official title
who you really are
is of course is another matter entirely
judging by the sacred ox on your ring
you are the secret head
of the temple of the four orders
into whose headquarters we now sit
on the northwest corner
of st james square i think
the only mystery that remains is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all
yes
well standard procedure i suppose
i dare say we have the
right man gentlemen
sherlock holmes
ambassador standish from america
and lord coward the home sewcretary
i suppose you alraedy have some notion
as to the practices of our order
yes
yes  they are practically interesting
you can be as skeptical as you like
but our secret systems
have steered the world for
the greater good for centuries
the danger is they can be used
for more nefarious purposes
what some call the dark arts
or practical magic
we know you dont believe in magic
mr holmes
we dont expect you to share our faith
merely
our fears
fear is the
more infectious condition
in this instance
fear of your own child
blackwood is your son
you have the same irises a rare dark green
the diamondshaped hazel flanks
together with identical arterias
which are only passed down
through direct blood lines
which makes you by necessity brothers
or in this case
more likely  father and son
very few people are privy
to that information
and we want to keep it that way
he was conceived during one
of our rituals
his mother wasnt my wife
but she shared our beliefs
she was a powerful practitioner
though not enough to
survive giving birth to him
death followed him
wherever he went
those five girls were not the first
to be butchered
he killed many more using them
to enhance his powers
no one could prove anything of course
but we all knew
the boy was a curse
wed done our best to stop him
ourselves but it was not enough
his power grows daily
his resurrection is evidence of that
but what he does next will
be far more dangerous
his secret lies in the book of spells
this is the source of his power
hes going to raise a force that will
alter the very course of the world
i want you to find him and stop him
before he does
well give you any assistance that we can
as home secretary i have considerable
influence over the police
so
name your price
well of great benefit to being
a consulting detective is that i
can pick and choose my clients
consider it done
ill stop him
but not for you
and certainly not for a price
i do have a parting query
sir thomas
what is that
if the rest of his family
is dead
how long do you expect to survive
food for thought
well perhaps youll have
better luck opening that
margaux 58
comet vintage
how fascinating that an astronomical
event can affect the quality
how is it going with our
case you refuse to take
wine
oh ive hit a dead end
literally
i found your man
hes buried in blackwoods tomb
if you still need him
oh dear
hope my client doesnt come
looking for a refund
hes a professor isnt he
i couldnt see his face but i
spotted a bit of chalk on his apparel
ive never known a teacher to carry a gun
and on such a clever contraption
eyepatch
nice touch
so  case closed
which makes this a social visit
no its a your in over your
head irene visit
whoever killed reordon
was covering their tracks
which makes you the
next loose end to be snipped
let it breathe
ive never been in over my head
leave now disappear
youre good at that
or stay and volunteer for
protective custody
if i am in danger
so are you
come with me
what if we trusted each other
youre not listening
im taking you
either to the railway staion
or the police station
so
what is it to be
you decide
which will it be
i told you to let it breathe
can you taste the comet
why couldnt you just
come away with me
madam i need you to remain calm
trust me im a professional
beneath this pillow
lies the key to my release
of course she misinterpreted
my intention entirely
naturally sir
thats why i find this modern
religious fanaticism so troubling
theres no latitude
for misunderstandings
thats right rhyme over reason
and chambermaids were
once such a liberal breed
my wifes a chambermaid
anyway good thing she was a friend of sarahs
or we might never have found you
the inspectors been over to
baker street himself this morning sir
just joking about the wife sir
ive checked everything
no sign of a breakin
and the butler didnt hear a thing
body in the nathtub
his eyes are wide open
and the only thing missing
was
his ring sir
why did you drain the water
out of common decency
crime is common
logic is rare
the decent thing to do is to catch the killer
not to provide comfort for the corpse
what is that
jasmine bath salt sir
superb probably comes from a
larger container
it will either be in the pantry
high up where it is warm and dry
or in a linen cupboard with a vent
and constable you could do worse
than to check the ground under the rear window
for footprints that are not your own
data data data i cannot make
bricks without clay
mr holmes
was it in the cupboard or the pantry
it was in the pantry sir
i dont know what to make of this
excellent work
adieu
what is the meaning of this coward
why have you called this meeting
sir thomas is dead
i nominate lord blackwood
as head of the order
have you lost your mind
you know damned well what he is capable of
of course he does
thats why we are here
thats why we are all here
my powers and my assets were
given to me for one purpose
magnificent  but simple purpose
to create a new future
a future  ruled  by us
tomorrow at noon we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history
magic will lead the way
once the people of england
see our newfound power
they will bow down in fear
across the atlantic lies
a colony that was once ours
it will be again
the civil war has made them weak
their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours
so well take it back
we will remake the world
create the future
these men are with me
standish
but  are you
no sir
i am not
these powers that you are playing with
no man can control
well gentlemen
someone has to stop them
even if you wont
i wouldnt do that if i were you
gentlemen
dont be afraid
as you can see
we are protected
come  drink to your allegiance here
you control the police
now use them
i didnt know you were here
since this room is no longer yours
do you mind if i  utilize it
be my guest
in here chaps
where do you want me to put it sir
anywhere in here is fine
who is he
hes the man who tried to kill
you at reordans lodgings
i suppose his neck didnt survive the
impact of dredger landing on him
yes  thanks for that by the way
but there is some consolation in the knowledge
that he can still be of service to his fellow man
elbow is long stained with blood
but its ultimately his own injuries
i dont know if its human
its not a butcher let me see
yellow flame green burst
an industrial worker
coal river silt
and the stripe on his trousers
should put him squarely in
nine elms
sorry what
the area youre looking for is nine elms
do you remember where i put the
lords registry of embassy interests
its on the stepladder
blackwood has had a dispatch at
anything that is corrosive to the spirit
woolidge arsenal
limehouse chemical works
probably be a factory
by the river
whats that
never mind
you dont know where my
rugby ball went do you
no not a clue
queens heights slaughterhouse
nine elms
a factory by the river
well done watson that should
lead us right to blackwood
dead or alive
not us
you
yes
just a figure of speech old boy
hes left it there on purpose
glad to see that you two
are working hard then
and i thought we were
trying to be discreet
you would not last
one day in the navy
holmes are you sure there
is no other alternative means
of water transportation than that
i guarantee you no one knows
londons waterways better
tim is practically a fish himself
certainly drinks like one
oh you found a sense of humor doctor
if only just a sense
better take over here
bit tricky down here
come on
look familiar
yes
all thats missing is a ginger midget
they cleared something away from here
not minutes ago
like what
im not sure
something mechanical
holmes
976a
look at this
118
chapter and verse
revelations 118
i am he that liveth and was dead
behold i am alive forevermore
i warned you holmes to accept
that this was beyond your control
beyond what your rational
mind could comprehend
what a busy afterlife you are having
i want you to be my witness
tomorrow at midday
the world as you know it
will end
show me your face and it will be
the end of your world right now
save your bullet watson
a gift for you
what wasd that about saving bullets
she followed you here holmes
you led your lamb to slaughter
holmes
this game is designed to hurt
watson
its warm in here watson
in over your head yet darling
hold on there
i cant
let me take your weight
give us a leg up old boy
these german locks
always give me trouble
its a bandsaw
no matter we have plenty of time
holmes
its not working
keep calm
holmes
hurry up
dont get excited
turn off that valve
and we bounce in three
two
one
thank you
im gonna get after blackwood
thank you
we shouldhelp the doctor
holmes
lord coward has issued a
warrant for your arrest sir
watson is alive
just get out of here gosir now
will the train be departing on time
the trains been delayed madam
shouldnt be long now though
the train will depart when i tell it to
and you will leave my employment
when i allow you to
i fulfilled my contract
i found reordan
hes in scotland yards mortuary
so thats me finished
your job was to manipulate
holmes feelings for you
not succumb to them
you have fulfilled nothing
i want what reardon
was making for blackwood
finish the job other the next dead
body will be sherlock holmes
the surgeon should be along shortly
you should be able to rest now
excuse me
is that the best you can do
yes for now
i must attend to my other patients
doctor
doctor
please
i know that you care for
him as much as i do
this is not your responsibility
it was his choice
hed say that it was worse than wounds
solve this
whatever it takes
its lord blackwood sir
ive never been in over my head
leave the case alone
youre not taking it seriously holmes
beyond your control
tomorrow at midday the world will end
public in frenzy
holmes
you and i are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature
steel your mind holmes
force that will alter the
very course of the world
increases in power
q
is the source of his power
i need you
the secret lies in the book of spells
three more will die
and there is nothing you
can do to save them
we know you dont believe in magic
reordon was working with blackwood
1063a
something was coming to get him
the only thing missing was his ring
give up holmes
is a riddle that you cannot solve
good morning
nowyou need to work
familiar artwork
you look gorgeous
somehow i knew you wouldnt leave
you made the front page
only a name and no picture
so it looks like you will need
to work outside the law now
and thats my area of expertise
i feel safer already
you seem to be making a rapid recovery
yes
took the shrapnel out myself
mary said i had a lousy doctor
well then um im just so very glad
thatyoure um
well with us
now that youre sitting
comfortably i shall begin
my initial approach
was far too narrow
when blackwood invited me
to pentonville prison
he suggested i widen my gaze
and at minimum i have done just that
in fact i may well have reconciled thousands
of years of theological dfisparity
but thats for another time
blackwoods method is based
on a ritualistic mystical system
thats been employed by the temple
of the four orders for centuries
to fully understand the system
to get inside it
i reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt
with a few enhancements of my own
my journey took me so much farther down
the rabbit hole than i had intended
and though i dirtied my fluffy white tail
i have emergedenlightened
a fraternity who silently
controlled the empire
shared the belief with the kings
pharaohs and emperors of old
that the sphinx was a door
to another dimension
a gateway to an immeasurable power
its made up of four parts
thye foot of a lion the tail of an ox
the wings of an eagle
and the head of a man
in sir thomas secret chamber
i found the bone of an ox
the tooth of a lion
the feather of an eagle
and the hair of a man
map
the points of the star represent
the five murdered girls
but the cross is what
we are now interested in
its a widely held belief that within
the architecture of the great cities
a coded reference system exists
since he arose from the grave
blackwood has killed three men
each murder was committed at a location
that has a direct connection with the temple
therefore  the system
reardon the ginger midget
represents man
we found his body  here
sir thomas  master of the temple
wore the ox ring
he died here
standish ambassador to america
where the eagle has
been the national emblem
for over a hundred years
headquarters for the temple
of the four orders where he died
is here
correspondingly the map will tell us
the location of blackwoods final act
so we have man the ox  eagle
only the lion remaining
right here
parliament
right you four stay here
the rest of you come with me
right this way
ladies first
follow these instructions
arent you going
hello hello hello
did the devil turn up
wellnever mind
you got the next best thing
beg your pardon my lord
i know that its unorthodox
but mr holmes here has been making
some serious accusations about you
and the  order
i see
well at least that solves the great mystery
as to how you became an inspector
excuse me my lord
but ive been wanting to
do that for a long time
well inspector i have five minutes
before my next engagement
so why dont you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy
thanks you lestrade
my lord
im curious coward did you assist
blackwood in all the murders
or just the one i prevented
very distinctive those
handmade shoes of yours
but the price of quality is often
the unique imprint they leave
nonetheless i confess to being
completely outmatched
i could deduce very little
from my investigation
fortunately there is nothing
more stimulating than a case
where everything goes against you
how many members of parliament
ido you intend to murder at noon today
man ox eagle lion
lion is the parliament tisnt it
very clever
but its not murder
mr holmes
its mercy
we are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd
dont you see that its for their own
no but i dont care much what you think
i jsimply wanted to know the location
of blackwoods final ceremony
and now youve given it to me
ive told you nothing
but your clothes say infinitely more
than you could ever hope
the mud smeared on your boots
from where youve been walking
a touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where youve been kneeling
a small bandage on your thumb
from where you have been vowing
a faint aroma of excrement
from where youve been standing
you and blackwood laid the final
touches to your ceremony in the sewers
beneath parliament
less than an hour ago
both houses meet today
the whole government would be present
its a shame you made an
enemy of blackwood holmes
you would have made a valuable ally
how terrible is wisdom
when it brings no profit to the wise
we take power at noon
there isnt any time to
waste then
is there
i told you you hed be coming out the
top window soldier boy there isnt any way
hed be coming out of that terrace
technically that isnt the
top window is it sailor boy
what is it
well its the middle window
anyway
you will be pleased to know lestrade
performed his role perfectly
i think he rather enjoyed it
i hope you know what
youre doing holmes
heres the key
you got all you needed from coward
yes i smoked him out
with relative ease
taylor
yes
if you would captain take us
under the bridge port side
approximately 100 yards beyond that you will find
the tunnel that leads us to the sewers
right away sir
1196a
the end is nigh
blackwoods come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land
behold blackwoods magic revealed
what does it do
it is a chemical weapon
first of its kind
you deduced that how
from my pocket
i slipped this over rather a cumbersome
rat at the slaughterhouse
notice the blue discoloration
the faintest smell of  bitter almonds
telltale traces of cyanide
now we know what the ginger midget was working on
it will revolutionize warfare
yes killing a lot of people
its now 7 minutes to noon
what are we going to do
well when
for a muse
shoot him
now please
the time has come
where only those who believe can remain
behold  lord blackwood
you seem surprised
i have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfill englands destiny
and extend the boundaries
of this great empire
listen to the rabble outside
listen
to the fear
i will use that as a weapon
to control them
and then the world
ive never seen anything like it
look at this
its specifically designed to
prevent us from disarming it
these components appear to be designed
to receive a signal of some sort
electromagnetic waves
when triggered the
electrodes will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas
the gas will travel up that shaft
and filter through the ventilation
system that leads directly to parliament
within seconds of its administration the
most powerful men in the world will
be choking on death
blackwood must have some kind of transmitter
that connects  with it remotely
three minutes ten seconds
i will create an empire
that will endure for millennia
indestructible
and eternal
move it
we dont actually have to disarm
the device we just have to
remove the cylinders
yes
except that theyre welded in
what we need is a controlled explosion
we need a container to direct the blast
like clay pipe should serve as that ambition
rather wish you hadnt done that irene
on the twelfth chime
i will summon the dark powers
all those who are with me
shall be protected
all others will perish
i need your pipe
nut him
a new order  begins now
what are you waiting for
that
apprehend coward
can you manage
of course i can
relax
im a doctor
did you take a wrong turning somewhere
were safe now
interesting assessment
run off
i wont be chasing you anymore
fare thee well
i dont want to run anymore
ill tell you everything
i wish you would
no
there was never any magic
only conjuring tricks
the simplest involve paying people off
like the prison guard who pretended to
be obsessed outside your cell
your reputation and the
inmates fear did the rest
others required more
elaborate preparations
like the sandstone slab
that covered your tomb
you had it broken before your burial and then
put back together with a mild adhesive
an ancient egyptian recipe i believe
a mixture of egg and honey
besides itd be washed away by the rain
holmes
arranging for your father
to drown in his own bathtub
required more modern science
very clever of reordan to find a paralytic
that was activated by the
combination of copper and water
and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained
it would have been quite a
challenge for me had he
not also tested it on some
unfortunate amphibian
the death of standish
was a real mystery
until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf
an odorless tasteless flammable liquid
gives it a burn with an unusual pink issue
did standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple
all it took was a spark
a simple rigged bullet in his gun
ingenious
like all great performers
you saved your pièce de résistance
for the end
a chemical weapon
distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine
had it worked your followers
in parliament would have
watched unharmed as their colleagues
wre dying around them
they didnt know you had
given them the antidote
instead they would have believed
and that youd harnessed the ultimate power
and the world would have followed
fear being the most
powerful weapon of all
youd better hope that its
its nothing more than superstition
and that you performed all the rituals perfectly
the devils due a soul id say
by gods sake holmes
cut me loose
first
the world will see you for what you are
a fraud
then you will be hanged
properly this time
its a long journey from here to the rope
ive never woken up in handcuffs before
i have
naked
a storm is coming
well  weve still got a moment
moriarty
what
thats his name
and he is a professor
everyone has a weak spot
and he found mine
where was it precisely
please dont underestimate him
hes just as brilliant as you are
and infinitely more indevious
well see about that
youll miss me sherlock
sadly yes
afternoon sir i put the
notebooks in this one sir
thank you
whats in these john
scribbles
scribbles
notes
theyre your adventures
id like to read them
hold on whats wrong
think hes finally come to terms with you leaving
mary look at the ring hes given us
now five minutes here and well go home
our home
get up those stairs
dont worry dear
suicide is not in his repertoire
hes far too fond of himself for that
holmes
oh
good afternoon
i was trying to deduce the manner in which
blackwood survived his execution
clearing our good names as well
but it had a surprising supporous effect on me
and i was carried off in the arms of morpheus
like a caterpillar in a cocoon
good afternoon dear
get on with it holmes
cleverly concealed in the hangmans knot was a hook
oh dear i think my legs have fallen asleep
i should probably come down
john shouldnt we help him down
no no no i hate to cut him off midstream
carry on
uh look the executioner attached it to a harness
thus allowing the weight to be distributed
around the waist
and the neck
to remain intact
oh my lord i cant feel my cheeks
might we continue this at ground level
how did you manage it holmes
i have managed it with braces belts
and a coat hook
please watson my tongue is growing
cold and ill be no use to you at all
worse things have happened
john
none of this explains
blackwoods lack of pulse
now the medical mystery
we must restore your reputation
watson
there is a toxin refined from the
nectar of the rhododendron ponticum
it is quite infamous in the region of turkey
bordering the black sea
for its ability to induce an
apparently mortal paralysis
enough to mislead a medical mind even as
welltrained and tenacious as your own
its known locally as
whats wrong with gladstone
mad honey disease
hes demonstrating the very
effect ive just described
hes all right
mary dont worry hes seen far worse
mr holmes
doctor miss mary
sir inspector lestrade asks that you
come with me right away
what is it this time clarky
its one of our sergeants sir
he went missing in the sewers
the day you stopped lord blackwood
im afraid sewage workers found
his body just this morning sir
we believe the sergeant
was the first man on the scene
can i help you officer
shot in the head
was it a small caliber bullet
yes
were there powder burns on his eyebrows
indeed sir
point blank range
moriarty
professor moriarty
theres a good boy
everythings going to be fine
where is blackwoods device now
secret service have it sir sir
theyve taken over the case
id wager theres a piece missing
so moriarty was after a piece of the machine
not the poison
theres nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact
access to the invention
was the goal all along
and adler was just a diversion
he knew id chase after her
thereby leaving the machine accessible
the technology of that kind would
be worth an untold fortune
imagine being able to control any device
by sending a command by radio waves
its the future watson
ive loaded the last of your boxes sir
well
