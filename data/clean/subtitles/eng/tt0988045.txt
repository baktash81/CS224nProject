i ve enjoyed it 
watson  don t 
observe 
how did you see that 
because i was looking for it 
lord blackwood 
you seem surprised 
i d say the girl deserves
attention more than he 
indeed 
oh  i d leave that alone
if i were you  boyo 
good lad 
impeccable timing 
lestrade 
we ve one for the doctor   
and one for the rope 
  clarky 
  sir 
this woman needs
a hospital immediately 
  put her in the back of the maria 
  right  lads  that s it 
pick him up lads 
if you don t mind 
get him out of my sight 
and you were supposed
to wait for my orders 
if i had  you d be
cleaning up a corpse 
and chasing a rumor 
besides  the girl s parents
hired me  not the yard 
why they thought you would
require any assistance is beyond me 
well  london will breathe a sigh of relief 
  indeed 
  congratulations  lestrade 
  bravo  inspector

gentlemen    
cheese 
156 over 80 
very good 
me nerves are the best they ve been
in years  thanks to you

i should be in
within the week 
cavendish place 
and there will be a woman s 
touch too 
well  that s marvelous  indeed 
good god 
  that was gunfire 
  no no 
hammer on nail  wasn t it 
my colleague  probably    
just putting up a painting 
i ll go and check 
  your colleague 
  yes
he won t be moving with you  will he 
no  he won t 
mrs  hudson    
i won t go in there by myself 
not while he s got a gun in his hand 
you don t have to go in there at all 
give me the paper 
what will i do when
you leave  doctor 
he ll have the whole house down 
he just needs another case 
that s all 
could you have a longer engagement 
i smell gunpowder  this is not right you know 
not in a domestic environment 
thank you  captain phillip 
perhaps a nice
cup of tea    
same time next week 
come along  captain 
it s quiet downstairs 
mrs  hudson 
bring something to cheer him up 
permission to enter
the armory
granted 
watson  i am in the process 
of inventing a device
that supresses the sound
    of a gunshot 
it s not working 
can i see that 
you know it s been three months
since your last case 
gently  gently  watson 
be gentle with me 
i do think it s time
you found another one 
i can t but agree 
my mind embellishes  technician 
giving me problems  giving me work 
the sooner the better 
paper 
let s see that 
there s a letter here 
mrs  ramsey    of queen s park 
her husband s disappeared 
he s in belgium  with the scullery maid 
is it november 
yes  holmes 
what 
lady radford reports    
oh  her emerald bracelet
has disappeared 
it is an insurance swindle 
lord radford likes fast women
and slow ponies 
i see you are the attending physician
at blackwood s hanging  
yes
it was our last case together
and i wanted to see it through to the end 
a mr  louis    
i m thinking of one case
that intrigues me at present 
the curious case of mrs  hudson
the absentee landlady 
i ve been studying her comings and goings 
  and they appear to be most   sinister 
  tea  mr  holmes 
is it poisoned   nanny  
there s enough of that in you already 
don t touch 
everything is in its proper place 
as usual   nanny  
oop  he s killed the dog    
again 
what have you done to gladstone 
now 
i was simply testing
a new anesthetic 
he doesn t mind 
holmes
as your doctor    
hell be straight as a trivet in no time 
as your friend 
you ve been in this room for two weeks 
i insist  you have to get out 
there is nothing of interest 
for me  out there on earth 
at all 
  so  you re free this evening 
  absolutely 
  dinner 
  wonderful 
  the royale 
  my favorite 
mary s coming 
  not available 
  you re meeting her  holmes 
have you proposed yet 
no  i haven t found the right ring 
so it s official 
it s happening  whether
yo like it or not 
8 30  the royale 
  wear a jacket 
  you wear a jacket 
  holmes 
  hmm 
you re early 
fashionably 
miss mary morsten 
ahh  my goodness  what a pleasure 
for the life of me i don t know why it has taken
so long for him to intoduce us properly 
the pleasure is mine 
it s really is quite a thrill to
meet you  mr  holmes 
i ve heard so much about you 
i have a pile of detective novels
at home  of collins  poe    
it s true 
it can seem a little farfetched 
though at some times
making these grand assumptions
out of such tiny details 
that s not quite right  is it 
in fact  the little details
are by far the most important 
  take watson    
  i intend to 
see his walking stick over there 
african snakewood 
hiding a blade of high tensile steel 
a few were rewarded to veterans 
of the afghan war 
so i can assume he is 
a decorated soldier 
strong  brave  brave
born to be an adventurer 
and neat 
as all military men 
now  i check his pockets 
ahh  a stub from a boxing match 
now  i can infer that 
he s a bit of a gambler 
i  d keep an eye on that dowry
if i were you 
  those days are behind me 
  right behind you 
it s cost us the rent
more than once 
well  with all due respect  mr  holmes 
you know john very well 
what about a complete stranger 
what can you tell about me 
  you 
  i don t think that s    
  i don t know that that s    
  not at dinner 
  perhaps another time 
  i insist 
  you insist 
  do you remember we discussed this 
the lady insists 
  you are a governess 
  well done 
yes  well done 
should we     waiter 
your student    
it s a boy of eight 
charlie is seven  actually 
then he s tall for his age 
he flicked ink at you today 
  is there ink on my face 
  there is nothing wrong with your face 
there are two drops on your ear  in fact 
india blue is almost
impossible to wash off 
anyway  a very impetuous act by the boy 
which you have experienced many times  
which is why
the lady for whom you work
lent you that necklace 
pearls  diamonds  flawless ruby  hardly    
the gems of a governess 
however  that jewels you are not wearing
tells us rather more
  holmes 
  you were engaged 
the ring has gone  but the lightness of
the skin where it once sat suggests
you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly
that is  until you were informed
of its true and rather modest worth 
at which point you broke off the 
engagement you returned to england 
for a better prospect 
a doctor  perhaps 
you re right on all counts 
mr  holmes  but for one 
i didn t leave him 
he died 
well done  old boy 
stand up and fight 
come on 
get up 
that s it  big man 
we re done 
you ve won  congratulations 
oi  we ain t done yet 
this mustn t register
on an emotional level 
first  distract target 
then block his blind jab 
counter with cross to left cheek 
discombobulate 
dazed  he ll attempt wild haymaker 
employ elbow block 
and body shot 
block thorough left 
weaken that jaw 
now fracture 
break cracked ribs 
traumamatize solar plexus 
dislocate jaw entirely 
heel kick to diaphragm 
in summary  ears ringing 
jaw fractured  three ribs
cracked  four broken 
diaphragm hemorrhaging 
physical recovery  6 weeks 
full psychological recovery  6 months 
capacity to spit at back of head   
neutralized 
where did that come from 
what the hell is going on here  charley 
lord blackwood put him under
some kind of spell  sir 
looks like he s burning
from the inside out 
shut up 
charley  charley 
take this man to the infirmary 
now 
what s this all about then  blackwood 
there s someone i want to see 
  watson 
  right 
let s go 
what started merely as an experiment
has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery 
now  if i play a chromatic scale
there s no measurable response 
you do know what you re drinking 
is meant for eye surgery 
but     now 
and this is remarkable
if i change to atonal clusters 
voila  
they fly in counter clockwise
synchronized concentric circles 
it is a regimented flock 
watson  this is exceptional 
i  using musical theory 
have created order from chaos 
how do you lure them in 
excellent question 
individually 
i ve been at it for six hours 
and what happens if i do this 
  right 
  clean yourself up 
you are blackwood s last request 
look at those towering structures 
it s the first combination of bascule s
suspension bridge ever attempted 
most innovative 
what an industrious empire 
oh  i have your winnings from last night 
you weren t there  
so i made your customary bet 
you re right 
i ll keep it with your checkbook 
locked safely away in my drawer 
did you know that the opera house
is featuring  don giovanni  
i could easily have procured a couple of tickets
if you have any cultural 
inclinations this evening 
you have a grand gift of silence  watson 
that makes you quite 
invaluable as a companion 
i knew she d been engaged 
she told me 
so that s no to the opera  then 
that was my waistcoat 
i thought we agreed that
it s too small for you 
  i would like it back 
  i thought we agreed 
i want it back 
this way  mr  holmes 
blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd in something of a fear frenzy 
well  i m certain it will disperse
once his feet have stopped twirling 
care to come along 
no  you are on your own  old cock 
i had no business with him
when he was alive 
suit yourself   mother hen  
it seems that you have 
lots of rooms to let 
yes  had to move the prisoners 
sir 
otherwise we would 
have a riot on our hands 
he has a peculiar effect
on the inmates as though   
he can get inside their heads 
i m sure i can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform 
much obliged  sir 
thank you  sir 
and i stood upon the sand of the sea  
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea  
having seven heads and ten horns  
and upon his horns ten crowns 
and upon his heads the name of blasphemy 
and they worshipped the dragon 
which gave power unto the beast
and they worshipped the beast  saying  
who is like unto the beast  
   the beast which i just saw
had the body of a leopard  
but had feet of a bear
and the mouth was the mouth of a lion 
the dragon gave his power unto the beast 
and his seat and his authority 
i love what you ve done with the place 
so glad you can accept my invitation 
i have just a small point of concern 
how can i help 
i ve already followed the murders
with some interest
and while my heart went out 
primarily to the families of the victims 
i can not but notice
the criminal mastery
in the stroking of your brush 
you are too kind 
however  by comparison 
your work in the crypt
was more akin to
a finger painting 
so now you re curious
as to whether there s a logicum afoot 
either that or    
shortly my friend will
pronounce you dead
and i m thought to maybe
keep you company 
your mistake is to imagine
that anything earthly
led us to this moment 
your error in judgment is to assume 
that i m holding the brush at all 
i m merely the channel 
my only wish was that
i could have caught you sooner 
five lives might
have been spared 
those lives were a necessity 
sacrifice 
five otherwise meaningless creatures
called to serve a higher purpose 
i wonder if they d let watson 
and me dissect your brain 
after you hang  of course 
i am sure that is some deformity 
that would be scientifically significant 
then you too could serve
a greater purpose 
holmes  you must
widen  your case 
i m concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events 
you and i are ebound together a journey that
will wist the very fabric of nature 
but beneath your mask of logic
i sense a fragility    
    that worries me 
steel your mind  holmes 
i need you 
i say  you ve come a long way
down from the house of lords 
  i will rise again 
   bon voyage  
pay attention 
three more will die and there is nothing
you can do to save them 
you must accept that this
is beyond your control 
by the time you realize
you made all this possible
it will be the last sane thought
in your head 
what did he want 
i m not sure 
but i dont think you will
need it  father  not for this one 
lord henry blackwood 
you are sentenced to death
for the practice of black magic 
the unholy murder of
five innocent young women 
and attempted murder of a sixth 
do you have any final words 
death     is only the beginning 
that is the end of
lord blackwood 
london is so bleak
this time of year 
not that i m pining for
new jersey 
much prefer to travel in the winter 
here  i brought you these 
all the way from syria 
i found these exquisite dates
in jordan
and your favorite    
olives from the cyclades 
i thought we might have
a little tea party   
and while i was setting the table 
i found this 
a file with my name on it 
 the theft of velasquez 
portrait of the king of spain 
 and missing naval documents
lead to the resignation 
of the bulgarian prime minister
scandalous affair
and engagement of      
 perhaps to both
romanov princes  
simply studying your methods 
in the event the authorities should 
ask me to hunt you down 
but i don t see my name in 
any of these articles 
but your signature was clear 
is that the maharaja s missing diamond 
or just another souvenir 
let s not dwell on the past 
shall we 
now  by the look of things 
i d say you were between jobs 
and you between husbands 
how much did you give for the ring 
he was boring  jealous 
and he snored 
i m irene adler again 
thank you 
i need your help 
i need you to find someone 
why are you always so suspicious 
should i answer chronologically
or alphabetically 
careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope 
i think you will find all the
information you need inside
who are you working for 
so  i ll have to find
out the hard way 
keep your money 
i didn t say that i d take the case 
well consider it a wager that you will 
do you emember the grand 
they gave me our old room 
hold the door 
thanks  doctor 
ma am 
  he ll do it 
  well done  miss adler 
that s precisely why
i hired you 
i ll wager he will have our man
within the next 24 hours 
he d better 
reordan is the key to what
blackwood was doing 
he s essential to my plan 
what s she doing 
can t you see where you re going 
get off out of it 
a liitle will go a long way  sir 
rubbing these callouses off this 
god save the queen 
god save the queen  sir 
get off out of it 
look at you 
the only woman you ever cared about   
a world class criminal 
are you a masochist 
allow me to explain    
allow me 
she is the only adversary who
ever outsmarted you     twice 
made a proper idiot out of you 
right  you ve had your fun 
  what s she want  anyway 
  time to press on 
what could she possibly need 
it doesn t matter 
a beard 
a human canoe 
she could sit on her back
and paddle you up the thames 
this is no consequence to you 
we ve done our last case together 
i ve already read it 
missing person 
luke reordan 
4 foot ten  red hair  no front teeth 
case solved 
you obviously do not have time 
she likes ginger dwarfs 
midgets 
  so  you agree 
  no  i don t agree 
it s more than a technicality 
you are misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples 
i ve said too much 
i can tell  i ve upset you 
no  i m just stating that one has   
what are you doing 
  will you allow me to explain 
  i wish you would 
  holmes  what are you doing 
  nothing 
  are you wearing a false nose 
  a false nose  no 
tell me  if that was    
holmes  where you going 
watson 
help  watson 
got some flowers for you  sweetheart 
cut you a deal
because you re so pretty 
oh  my lucky day 
i got gold if you do some for me 
do not move 
now what have we got here 
thank you 
that s the irene i knew 
this plan intrigues me me  watson 
he s got adler on edge 
which is no mean feat 
she s intimidated
she s scared of him 
yet she works for him 
right 
it s nothing to do with me  but i d advise 
you to leave the case alone 
well  i may not have a choice  hmm 
after all  i may be paying the rent alone
soon  thanks to you 
get that out of my face 
it s not in your face 
it s in my hand 
get what is in your hand
out of my face 
  mr  holmes 
  clarky 
sir  inspector lestrade asks that you
come with me at once 
what s he done now 
lost his way to scotland yard 
watson  grab a compass 
you means us 
no  you means you 
it s about lord blackwood 
sir  he    
it appears he s come
back from the grave  sir 
  most engaging 
  very clever 
i pronounced the man dead myself 
what are the facts 
groundskeeper claims he saw him walking
through the graveyard just this morning  sir 
i ll leave this in your capable hands 
i have an appointment with mary 
it s not my reputation that s at stake here 
don t try that 
have the newspapers got wind of it yet 
well  that s what we re trying to avoid  sir 
certainly 
  what s the major concern 
  panic  sheer  bloody panic  sir 
indeed 
you re not taking this seriously 
are you holmes 
yes 
as you should 
it s a matter of
professional integrity 
no girl wants to
marry a doctor who
can t tell if a man
is dead or not 
who do you think won the match 
clarky 
  sir 
  the rugby match 
your boys have done a magnificent job
of obliterating any potential evidence 
yes  but at least they never
miss an opportunity
to miss an opportunity 
you took the time  holmes 
 and on the third day     
these slabs were sandstone 
half a ton each  if they re a pound 
and they re smashed open from the inside 
lestrade  what of the coffin 
we are in the process of
bringing it up now 
i see  hmpf 
right 
at what stage of the process 
contemplative 
and how is our witness 
he s over there 
and apparently he s cata  
cat    
catatonic  sir 
  he s not feeling very well 
  yes 
now if you lot don t stop behaving like
a bunch of quivering milkmaids
you re on double time 
now you get down there and
you bring that coffin up    
now 
good day  sir 
all right 
i m a doctor 
the man s in shock 
he may need a few moments 
the witness stated that he saw 
lord blackwood rising from the grave 
  well 
  well 
you pronounced him dead 
he had no pulse 
good lord 
that s not blackwood 
well  now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious 
time of death 
diptera is approximately    
2 3 of an inch
which would put the time of death
between ten and twleve hours ago 
may i borrow your pen 
  headless dwarf 
  midget 
i know what i saw 
it was blackwood 
as clear as i see you 
and when the dead walk   
the living will fill these coffins 
well    um   
right  put the lid on it 
and clean this lot up 
you really believe he was resurrected 
the question is not  if  but  how  
the game s afoot 
 follow your spirit and upon this charge
cry god for harry  england
and st  george  
why that certain fish and chips store 
i don t understand 
that particular beer they use 
a northern stout to be exact 
you know  holmes
i ve seen things in war
i don t understand 
in india  i once met a man
who predicted his own death
right down to the number and placement
of the bullets that killed him 
you have to admit  holmes 
that a supernatural explanation
to this case  is theoretically possible 
no  agreed  but    
it is a huge mistake to theorize
before one has data 
inevitably  one begins to twist facts
to suit theory
instead of theories to suit facts 
that said  i believe our midget
is the key to this 
right  scratches around the 
keyhole where the watch is wound 
what does that tell you 
the man was likely
a drunk 
every time he wound the watch 
his hand would slip and hence the scratch 
  yes 
  very good  watson 
you have developed considerable
deductive powers of your own 
let s see now  there are several
sets of initials scored  
  pawn brokers mark 
  excellent 
the mostb recent of which are
 m h  m h  m h       
  is for    
   maddison and haig  
they should be able to give us an address 
what a coincidence 
there is one thing you ve failed to deduce
from the watch  holmes 
really  i think not 
the time 
i have to get back  holmes 
taking tea with the in laws 
  predicting your future  sir 
  absolutely not 
no thank you  ma am 
you need to hear what i have to tell you 
we have no need of your
lucky hela  gypsy woman 
even if it s to do with mary 
i see two men 
brothers  not in blood  but in bond  
what of mary 
and from mary 
for marriage  oh  you will be married 
go on 
i see patterned table cloths and   
chain of figurines    
lace doilies   
doilies 
lace doilies  holmes 
  does your depravity know no bounds 
  no 
oh  she turns to fat and 
she has a beard 
and she has a big wart   
what of the warts 
  she is covered in warts 
  enough 
  are they extensive 
  please  enough 
it s a most apt prediction flora has made 
and precisely the reason
you can t find a suitable ring 
do you have my money 
you are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre 
do you have my money 
  admit it  admit it 
  give me my money 
holmes 
i see 
thank you 
you ve got your ring and 
i ve got my address for the ginger midget 
should be just there 
i think she ll really like this 
and i have some change in my pocket 
  shall i look after it for you 
  no no 
  don t give it away here 
  no 
i have to go see mary 
give her my best 
and the family as well 
it does make a considerable difference
to me having  
someone with me on whom 
i can thoroughly rely 
well  you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes 
he clearly felt something
would come after him 
something did 
irene adler was here 
either that  or the ginger midget 
wore the same parisian perfume 
ahhh  putrefaction 
ammonium sulphate 
among other aromas 
phosphorus 
formaldehyde 
it looks like   
he was attempting to combine
some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula 
more impotantly   
let s see what he was trying to dispose of 
potassium  magnesium 
sultafitic acid 
try to take the ion out of the ink
as long as it s not too burnt 
peculiar 
hydrated rhododendron 
holmes 
look at the crest 
reordan was working with blackwood 
of course he was 
the question is   
to what end 
whatever he was working on   
he clearly succeeded 
how so 
otherwise  he d still
be alive 
which is why miss adler
is so desperate to find him 
yes 
there s one odor i can t
quite put my finger on 
is it candy floss 
molasses 
maple syrup 
  brown sugar 
  toffee 
  apple 
let me guess 
judging by your arsenous tool kit 
you re here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein 
just one minute  boys 
oh  dredger 
there a problem 
meat    
or potatoes 
my ten minutes are up 
you all right 
come 
holmes 
what is that 
holmes 
watson    
what on earth have you done 
i haven t slept all night 
not a wink 
why i ever believed    
that i would get to have tea
with mary s parents
is beyond me  having been talkind 
into going with you 
we could say it was in self defense 
i ve been reviewing my notes 
our exploits over tha last seven months 
would you like to know my conclusion 
i am psychologically disturbed 
how so 
why else would i continually 
be led into situations
where you deliberately 
withhold your plans for me 
why else 
you never complained about
my methods before 
  i m not complaining 
  you re not 
what do you call this 
how am i complaining 
i never complain 
when do i complain about yout practicing
the violin at 3 in the morning 
or your mess  or your
general lack of hygiene
or the fact that you steal my clothes 
we have a barter system 
when do i complain about you
setting fire to my rooms 
our rooms 
the rooms  when do i complain that
you experiment on my dog 
  our dog 
  on the the dog 
  it s our dog 
what i do take issue with is your
campaign to sabotage my relationship
with mary 
i understand 
  do you 
  i do 
  i don t think you do 
  you re overtired 
  yes
  you re feeling a bit sensitive 
i m not sensitive 
what you need is a rest 
my brother  mycroft 
has a small estate near chichester 
beautiful grounds 
there s a falls    
we could throw a lamb on the spit 
we  holmes  if i were to go to the 
country it would be with my future wife 
well  certainly  if we must    
not you  mary and i 
  you are not    
  what  invited 
why would i not be invited to my
own brother s country home  watson 
  you are not making any sense 
  you re not human 
  john watson 
  yes 
your bail has been posted 
mary 
just watson 
i hope you get bail by breakfast 
because boys are getting hungry 
back off  back off 
to which the barman says 
 may i push in your stool  
not you  you re out 
  until next time 
  always a pleasure  mr  holmes 
thank heaven you re here  lestrade
i d almost ran out of jokes 
you know  in another life 
you d have made an excellent criminal 
yes  and you  sir 
an excellent policeman 
tomsky  thank you 
please tell me you have answers 
all in good time  lestrade 
all in good time  what is this  some parlor game
where we have to guess what your re thinking 
i ve got a public in frenzy out there
now if you don t fill me in
i ll have you in there 
playing victoria and albert
quicker than a bookie s runner 
now  clean up and make yourself presentable 
for whom 
i have friends in high places 
they re the ones
who bailed you out of there 
i m terribly sorry to 
inconvenience you  sir 
but i m going to have
to put this on you 
mr  holmes  apologies
for summoning you like this 
i m sure it s quite a mystery as to
where you are and who i am 
as to where i am    
i was admittedly lost for a moment 
between charing cross and holborn 
but i was saved by the bread shop
on saffron hill 
the only baker to use a certain 
french glaze on their loaves 
a brittany sage 
after that the carriage fork left
and right
a telltale bump at the fleet conduit
as to who you are
it took every ounce of my not
inconsiderabile experience 
the letters on your desk are
addressed to sir thomas rodrum 
you are chief justice  that
would be your official title 
who you really are   
is of course is another matter entirely 
judging by the sacred ox on your ring
you are the secret head
of the temple of the four orders 
into whose headquarters we now sit
on the northwest corner
of st  james square  i think 
the only mystery that remains is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all 
yes    
well  standard procedure i suppose 
i dare say we have the
right man  gentlemen 
sherlock holmes 
ambassador standish from america 
and lord coward  the home sewcretary 
i suppose you alraedy have some notion
as to the practices of our order 
yes 
yes     they are practically interesting 
you can be as skeptical as you like 
but our secret systems
have steered the world for 
the greater good for centuries 
the danger is they can be used
for more nefarious purposes 
what some call the dark arts
or practical magic 
we know you don t believe in magic 
mr  holmes 
we don t expect you to share our faith 
merely
our fears 
fear is the 
more infectious condition
in this instance 
fear of your own child 
blackwood is your son 
you have the same irises  a rare dark green 
the diamond shaped hazel flanks 
together with identical arterias
which are only passed down
through direct blood lines
which makes you by necessity brothers
or in this case 
more likely     father and son 
very few people are privy 
to that information 
and we want to keep it that way 
he was conceived during one
of our rituals 
his mother wasn t my wife 
but she shared our beliefs 
she was a powerful practitioner 
though not enough to 
survive giving birth to him 
death followed him 
wherever he went 
those five girls were not the first
to be butchered 
he killed many more using them 
to enhance his powers 
no one could prove anything  of course 
but we all knew 
the boy was a curse 
we d done our best to stop him 
ourselves  but it was not enough 
his power grows daily 
his resurrection is evidence of that 
but what he does next will 
be far more dangerous 
his secret lies in the book of spells 
this is the source of his power 
he s going to raise a force that will 
alter the very course of the world 
i want you to find him and stop him
before he does 
we ll give you any assistance that we can 
as home secretary  i have considerable
influence over the police 
so    
name your price 
well  of great benefit to being
a consulting detective is that i
can pick and choose my clients 
consider it done 
i ll stop him 
but not for you 
and certainly not for a price 
i do have a parting query 
sir thomas 
what is that 
if the rest of his family
is dead   
how long do you expect to survive 
food for thought 
well  perhaps you ll have
better luck opening that 
margaux  58 
comet vintage 
how fascinating that an astronomical
event can affect the quality    
how is it going with our 
case you refuse to take 
    wine 
oh  i ve hit a dead end   
literally 
i found your man 
he s buried in blackwood s tomb 
if you still need him 
oh dear   
hope my client doesn t come
looking for a refund 
he s a professor  isn t he 
i couldn t see his face  but i 
spotted a bit of chalk on his apparel 
i ve never known a teacher to carry a gun
and on such a clever contraption 
eyepatch 
nice touch 
so     case closed 
which makes this a social visit 
no  it s a your in over your
head irene visit 
whoever killed reordon 
was covering their tracks 
which makes you the 
next loose end to be snipped 
let it breathe 
i ve never been in over my head 
leave now  disappear 
you re good at that 
or stay  and volunteer for 
protective custody 
if i am in danger 
so are you 
come with me 
what if we trusted each other 
you re not listening 
i m taking you   
either to the railway staion
or the police station  
so    
what is it to be 
you decide 
which will it be 
i told you to let it breathe 
can you taste the comet 
why couldn t you just
come away with me 
madam  i need you to remain calm 
trust me  i m a professional 
beneath this pillow
lies the key to my release 
of course  she misinterpreted
my intention entirely 
  naturally  sir 
  that s why i find this modern
religious fanaticism so troubling 
there s no latitude
for misunderstandings 
that s right  rhyme over reason 
and chambermaids were 
once such a liberal breed 
my wife s a chambermaid 
anyway  good thing she was a friend of sarah s
or we might never have found you 
the inspector s been over to
baker street himself this morning  sir 
just joking about the wife  sir 
i ve checked everything 
no sign of a break in
and the butler didn t hear a thing 
body in the nathtub 
his eyes are wide open
and the only thing missing
was    
his ring  sir 
why did you drain the water 
out of common decency 
crime is common 
logic is rare 
the decent thing to do is to catch the killer
not to provide comfort for the corpse 
what is that 
jasmine bath salt  sir 
superb  probably comes from a
larger container 
it will either be in the pantry
high up  where it is warm and dry 
or in a linen cupboard with a vent 
and constable  you could do worse
than to check the ground under the rear window
for footprints that are not your own 
data  data  data  i cannot make
bricks without clay 
mr holmes 
was it in the cupboard or the pantry 
it was in the pantry  sir 
i don t know what to make of this 
excellent work 
adieu  
what is the meaning of this  coward 
why have you called this meeting 
sir thomas is dead 
i nominate lord blackwood
as head of the order 
have you lost your mind 
you know damned well what he is capable of 
of course he does 
that s why we are here 
that s why we are all here 
my powers and my assets were
given to me for one purpose 
magnificent     but simple purpose 
to create a new future 
a future     ruled     by us 
tomorrow  at noon  we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history 
magic will lead the way 
once the people of england
see our newfound power
they will bow down in fear 
across the atlantic lies
a colony that was once ours 
it will be again 
the civil war has made them weak 
their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours 
so we ll take it back 
we will remake the world 
create the future 
these men are with me 
standish 
but     are you 
no  sir 
i am not 
these powers that you are playing with    
no man can control 
well gentlemen 
someone has to stop them 
even if you won t 
i wouldn t do that if i were you 
gentlemen    
don t be afraid 
as you can see 
we are protected 
come     drink to your allegiance here 
you control the police  
now use them 
i didn t know you were here 
since this room is no longer yours 
do you mind if i     utilize it 
be my guest 
  in here  chaps 
  where do you want me to put it sir 
anywhere in here is fine 
who is he 
he s the man who tried to kill
you at reordan s lodgings 
i suppose his neck didn t survive the
impact of dredger landing on him 
yes     thanks for that  by the way 
but there is some consolation in the knowledge
that he can still be of service to his fellow man 
elbow is long stained with blood 
but it s ultimately his own injuries 
i don t know if it s human  
it s not a butcher  let me see   
yellow flame  green burst 
an industrial worker 
coal  river silt 
and the stripe on his trousers
should put him squarely in    
nine elms 
sorry  what 
the area you re looking for is nine elms 
do you remember where i put the 
lord s registry of embassy interests 
it s on the stepladder 
blackwood has had a dispatch at
anything that is corrosive to the spirit 
woolidge arsenal 
limehouse chemical works 
probably be a factory
by the river 
what s that 
never mind 
you don t know where my 
rugby ball went  do you 
no  not a clue 
queen s heights slaughterhouse 
nine elms 
a factory by the river 
well done  watson  that should 
lead us right to blackwood 
dead or alive 
not us 
you 
yes 
just a figure of speech  old boy 
he s left it there on purpose 
glad to see that you two 
are working hard  then 
and i thought we were 
trying to be discreet 
you would not last 
one day in the navy 
holmes  are you sure there
is no other alternative means 
of water transportation than that 
i guarantee you no one knows
london s waterways better 
tim is practically a fish himself 
certainly drinks like one 
oh  you found a sense of humor  doctor 
if only just a sense 
better take over here 
bit tricky down here 
come on 
  look familiar 
  yes 
all that s missing is a ginger midget 
they cleared something away from here 
not minutes ago 
like what 
i m not sure 
something mechanical 
holmes 
976a
look at this 
  1 18
  chapter and verse 
revelations  1 18 
i am he that liveth  and was dead 
behold i am alive  forevermore  
i warned you  holmes  to accept 
that this was beyond your control 
beyond what your rational 
mind could comprehend 
what a busy afterlife you are having 
i want you to be my witness 
tomorrow  at midday  
the world as you know it   
will end 
show me your face and it will be
the end of your world right now 
save your bullet  watson 
a gift for you 
what wasd that about saving bullets 
she followed you here  holmes 
you led your lamb to slaughter 
holmes 
this game is designed to hurt 
watson 
it s warm in here  watson 
in over your head yet  darling 
  hold on there 
  i can t 
let me take your weight 
give us a leg up  old boy 
these german locks 
always give me trouble 
it s a bandsaw 
no matter  we have plenty of time 
holmes    
  it s not working 
  keep calm 
holmes 
hurry up 
don t get excited 
turn off that valve 
and we bounce in three    
    two 
    one 
thank you 
i m gonna get after blackwood 
thank you 
we should   help the doctor 
holmes 
lord coward has issued a 
warrant for your arrest  sir 
watson is alive 
just get out of here  go sir  now 
will the train be departing on time 
the train s been delayed  madam 
shouldn t be long now though 
the train will depart when i tell it to 
and you will leave my employment 
when i allow you to 
i fulfilled my contract 
i found reordan 
he s in scotland yard s mortuary 
so that s me finished 
your job was to manipulate 
holmes  feelings for you   
not succumb to them 
you have fulfilled nothing  
i want what reardon
was making for blackwood  
finish the job  other the next dead
body will be sherlock holmes 
the surgeon should be along shortly 
you should be able to rest now 
excuse me 
is that the best you can do 
yes  for now 
i must attend to my other patients 
doctor    
doctor 
please 
i know that you care for 
him as much as i do 
this is not your responsibility 
it was his choice 
he d say that it was worse than wounds 
solve this 
whatever it takes 
 it s lord blackwood  sir  
i ve never been in over my head 
 leave the case alone 
 you re not taking it seriously  holmes  
 beyond your control 
 tomorrow at midday  the world will end
public in frenzy 
 holmes  
 you and i are bound together on a journey 
that will twist the very fabric of nature  
 steel your mind  holmes  
     force that will alter the
very course of the world 
 increases in power   
q
     is the source of his power   
 i need you   
 the secret lies in the book of spells  
 three more will die     
 and there is nothing you 
can do to save them 
 we know you don t believe in magic  
 reordon was working with blackwood  
1063a
 something was coming to get him 
 the only thing missing was his ring 
 give up  holmes  
 is a riddle that you cannot solve 
good morning 
now   you need to work 
familiar artwork 
you look gorgeous 
somehow i knew you wouldn t leave 
you made the front page 
only a name and no picture 
so    it looks like you will need 
to work outside the law now   
and that s my area of expertise 
i feel safer already 
you seem to be making a rapid recovery 
yes    
took the shrapnel out myself 
mary said i had a lousy doctor 
well then    um    i m just so very glad   
that   you re um   
well    with us 
now that you re sitting 
comfortably i shall begin 
my initial approach
was far too narrow 
when blackwood invited me
to pentonville prison
he suggested i widen my gaze
and at minimum i have done just that 
in fact  i may well have reconciled thousands
of years of theological dfisparity 
but that s for another time 
blackwood s method is based
on a ritualistic mystical system
that s been employed by the temple
of the four orders for centuries 
to fully understand the system 
to get inside it
i reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt 
with a few enhancements of my own 
my journey took me so much farther down 
the rabbit hole than i had intended
and though i dirtied my fluffy white tail
i have emerged   enlightened 
a fraternity who silently 
controlled the empire
shared the belief with the kings 
pharaohs  and emperors of old
that the sphinx was a door
to another dimension 
a gateway to an immeasurable power 
it s made up of four parts 
thye foot of a lion  the tail of an ox 
the wings of an eagle
and the head of a man 
in sir thomas  secret chamber 
i found the bone of an ox
the tooth of a lion 
the feather of an eagle  
and the hair of a man 
map 
the points of the star represent 
the five murdered girls 
but the cross is what 
we are now interested in 
it s a widely held belief that within
the architecture of the great cities
a coded reference system exists 
since he arose from the grave
blackwood has killed three men 
each murder was committed at a location
that has a direct connection with the temple 
therefore     the system 
reardon  the ginger midget 
represents man 
we found his body     here 
sir thomas     master of the temple 
wore the ox ring 
he died here 
standish  ambassador to america 
where the eagle has 
been the national emblem
for over a hundred years 
headquarters for the temple
of the four orders  where he died   
is here 
correspondingly  the map will tell us
the location of blackwood s final act 
so  we have man  the ox   eagle     
only the lion remaining 
right here 
parliament 
right  you four stay here 
the rest of you come with me 
right this way 
ladies first 
  follow these instructions 
  aren t you going 
hello hello hello 
did the devil turn up 
well   never mind 
you got the next best thing 
beg your pardon  my lord 
i know that it s unorthodox 
but mr  holmes  here  has been making 
some serious accusations about you 
and the  order 
i see 
well  at least that solves the great mystery 
as to how you became an inspector 
excuse me  my lord 
but i ve been wanting to 
do that for a long time 
well  inspector  i have five minutes
before my next engagement 
so why don t you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy 
thanks you  lestrade 
my lord 
i m curious  coward  did you assist
blackwood in all the murders   
or just the one i prevented 
very distinctive those 
handmade shoes of yours 
but the price of quality is often
the unique imprint they leave 
nonetheless  i confess to being 
completely outmatched 
i could deduce very little 
from my investigation 
fortunately there is nothing 
more stimulating than a case
where everything goes against you 
how many members of parliament
ido you intend to murder at noon today 
man  ox  eagle  lion 
lion is the parliament  tisn t it 
very clever 
but it s not murder 
mr  holmes 
it s mercy 
we are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd 
don t you see that it s for their own   
no  but i don t care much what you think 
i jsimply wanted to know the location
of blackwood s final ceremony 
and now you ve given it to me 
i ve told you nothing 
but your clothes say infinitely more
than you could ever hope 
the mud smeared on your boots 
from where you ve been walking 
a touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you ve been kneeling 
a small bandage on your thumb
from where you have been vowing 
a faint aroma of excrement 
from where you ve been standing 
you and blackwood laid the final
touches to your ceremony in the sewers 
beneath parliament
less than an hour ago 
both houses meet today 
the whole government would be present 
it s a shame you made an 
enemy of blackwood  holmes 
you would have made a valuable ally 
how terrible is wisdom
when it brings no profit to the wise 
we take power at noon 
there isn t any time to 
waste then    
is there 
i told you you he d be coming out the 
top window  soldier boy  there isn t any way
he d be coming out of that terrace 
technically  that isn t the 
top window  is it  sailor boy 
  what is it 
  well  it s the middle window 
anyway 
you will be pleased to know lestrade 
performed his role perfectly 
i think he rather enjoyed it 
i hope you know what 
you re doing  holmes 
here s the key 
you got all you needed from coward 
yes  i smoked him out
with relative ease 
  taylor 
  yes 
if you would  captain  take us
under the bridge  port side 
approximately 100 yards  beyond that you will find
the tunnel that leads us to the sewers 
right away  sir 
1196a
the end is nigh 
blackwood s come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land 
behold  blackwood s magic revealed 
what does it do 
it is a chemical weapon 
first of its kind 
you deduced that how 
from my pocket 
i slipped this over rather a cumbersome
rat at the slaughterhouse 
notice the blue discoloration 
the faintest smell of  bitter almonds 
telltale traces of cyanide 
now we know what the ginger midget was working on 
it will revolutionize warfare 
yes  killing a lot of people 
it s now 7 minutes to noon  
what are we going to do 
well when    
   for a muse
shoot him  
now  please 
the time has come 
where only those who believe can remain 
behold     lord blackwood 
you seem surprised 
i have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfill england s destiny 
and extend the boundaries
of this great empire 
listen to the rabble outside 
listen    
to the fear 
i will use that as a weapon
to control them    
and then the world 
i ve never seen anything like it 
look at this 
it s specifically designed to
prevent us from disarming it 
these components appear to be designed 
to receive a signal of some sort 
electromagnetic waves 
when triggered the
electrodes will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas
the gas will travel up that shaft
and filter through the ventilation 
system that leads directly to parliament 
within seconds of its administration  the 
most powerful men in the world will
be choking on death 
blackwood must have some kind of transmitter
that connects  with it remotely 
three minutes  ten seconds 
i will create an empire
that will endure for millennia 
indestructible
   and eternal 
move it 
we don t actually have to disarm
the device  we just have to
remove the cylinders 
yes 
except that they re welded in 
what we need is a controlled explosion 
we need a container to direct the blast 
like clay pipe  should serve as that ambition 
rather wish you hadn t done that  irene 
on the twelfth chime 
i will summon the dark powers 
all those who are with me
shall be protected 
all others will perish 
i need your pipe 
nut him 
a new order     begins now 
what are you waiting for 
that 
apprehend coward 
  can you manage 
  of course i can 
relax 
i m a doctor 
did you take a wrong turning somewhere 
we re safe now 
interesting assessment 
run off 
i won t be chasing you anymore 
fare thee well 
i don t want to run anymore 
i ll tell you everything 
i wish you would 
no 
there was never any magic 
only conjuring tricks 
the simplest involve paying people off 
like the prison guard who pretended to
be obsessed outside your cell 
your reputation and the 
inmates  fear did the rest 
others required more 
elaborate preparations 
like the sandstone slab 
that covered your tomb 
you had it broken before your burial and then
put back together with a mild adhesive 
an ancient egyptian recipe  i believe 
a mixture of egg and honey 
besides  it d be washed away by the rain 
holmes 
arranging for your father
to drown in his own bathtub
required more modern science 
very clever of reordan to find a paralytic
that was activated by the 
combination of copper and water 
and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained 
it would have been quite a 
challenge for me had he
not also tested it on some 
unfortunate amphibian 
the death of standish
was a real mystery
until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf 
an odorless  tasteless  flammable liquid
gives it a burn with an unusual pink issue 
did standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple 
all it took was a spark 
a simple rigged bullet in his gun 
ingenious 
like all great performers  
you saved your pièce de résistance
for the end
a chemical weapon 
distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine 
had it worked  your followers
in parliament would have 
watched unharmed as their colleagues 
wre dying around them 
they didn t know you had 
given them the antidote 
instead they would have believed
and that you d harnessed the ultimate power 
and the world would have followed 
fear being the most 
powerful weapon of all 
you d better hope that it s
it s nothing more than superstition
and that you performed all the rituals perfectly 
the devil s due a soul  i d say 
by god s sake  holmes
cut me loose 
first 
the world will see you for what you are 
a fraud 
then you will be hanged   
properly this time 
it s a long journey from here to the rope 
i ve never woken up in handcuffs before 
i have 
naked 
a storm is coming 
well     we ve still got a moment 
  moriarty    
  what 
that s his name 
and he is a professor 
everyone has a weak spot 
and he found mine 
where was it  precisely 
please don t underestimate him 
he s just as brilliant as you are 
and infinitely more indevious 
we ll see about that 
you ll miss me  sherlock 
sadly    yes 
  afternoon  sir  i put the 
  notebooks in this one  sir 
  thank you 
what s in these  john 
  scribbles 
  scribbles 
  notes 
  they re your adventures 
i d like to read them 
hold on  what s wrong 
think he s finally come to terms with you leaving 
mary  look at the ring he s given us 
now  five minutes here  and we ll go home 
our home 
get up those stairs 
don t worry  dear 
suicide is not in his repertoire 
he s far too fond of himself for that 
holmes 
oh  
good afternoon 
i was trying to deduce the manner in which
blackwood survived his execution 
clearing our good names as well 
but it had a surprising supporous effect on me 
and i was carried off in the arms of morpheus 
like a caterpillar in a cocoon 
good afternoon  dear 
get on with it  holmes 
cleverly concealed in the hangman s knot was a hook 
oh dear  i think my legs have fallen asleep 
i should probably come down 
john  shouldn t we help him down 
no  no  no  i hate to cut him off midstream 
carry on 
uh  look  the executioner attached it to a harness
thus allowing the weight to be distributed
around the waist
and the neck    
to remain intact 
oh  my lord  i can t feel my cheeks 
might we continue this at ground level 
how did you manage it  holmes 
i have managed it with braces  belts 
and a coat hook 
please  watson  my tongue is growing 
cold and i ll be no use to you at all 
  worse things have happened 
  john 
none of this explains
blackwood s lack of pulse 
now  the medical mystery 
we must restore your reputation 
watson 
there is a toxin refined from the
nectar of the rhododendron ponticum 
it is quite infamous in the region of turkey
bordering the black sea
for its ability to induce an
apparently mortal paralysis 
enough to mislead a medical mind even as
well trained and tenacious as your own 
it s known locally as    
what s wrong with gladstone 
mad honey disease  
he s demonstrating the very 
effect i ve just described 
he s all right 
mary  don t worry  he s seen far worse 
mr  holmes 
doctor  miss mary    
sir  inspector lestrade asks that you 
come with me right away 
what is it this time  clarky 
it s one of our sergeants  sir 
he went missing in the sewers
the day you stopped lord blackwood  
i m afraid sewage workers found
his body just this morning  sir 
we believe the sergeant
was the first man on the scene 
can i help you  officer 
    shot in the head 
was it a small caliber bullet 
yes 
were there powder burns on his eyebrows 
indeed  sir 
point blank range 
moriarty 
professor moriarty 
there s a good boy 
everything s going to be fine 
where is blackwood s device now 
secret service have it sir  sir 
they ve taken over the case 
i d wager there s a piece missing 
so moriarty was after a piece of the machine 
not the poison 
there s nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact 
access to the invention
was the goal all along 
and adler was just a diversion 
he knew i d chase after her
thereby leaving the machine accessible 
the technology of that kind would
be worth an untold fortune 
imagine being able to control any device
by sending a command by radio waves 
it s the future  watson 
i ve loaded the last of your boxes  sir 
  well
