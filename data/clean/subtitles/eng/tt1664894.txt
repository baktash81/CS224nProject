ardèche river
southern france
less quarter mile
three explorers set
days christmas
came along way
seeking drafts air emanating ground
would point presence caves
eventually sensed subtle airflow
began clearing away rocks
revealing narrow shaft cliff
narrow
person could barely squeeze
descended unknown
make one greatest discoveries
history human culture
first cave appear
contain anything special
aside particularly beautiful
deep inside found
would turn cave pristine
perfectly sealed tens thousands years
contained far oldest cave paintings
dating back years
fact oldest paintings ever discovered
twice old
honor leading discoverer jeanmarie chauvet
cave bears name chauvet cave
road ardèche gorge
leading cave
early spring
given unprecedented endorsement
french ministry culture
film inside cave
first day discovery
importance cave immediately recognized
access shut categorically
small group scientists allowed enter
archaeologists art historians
paleontologists geologists among others
perform studies together
short weeks end march
beginning april
one rare times
anyone exception two guards
allowed inside cave
cave like frozen flash moment time
reason pristine condition
rock face
years ago came tumbling
massive rock slide
sealing original entrance cave
creating perfect time capsule
wooden walkway leads entrance chauvet cave
narrow tunnel discoverers crawled
widened
locked massive steel door
like bank vault
pass door locked behind us
compromise delicate climate inside
first exploration cave
using tiny nonprofessional camera rig
first narrow holding room
fitted sterile boots
given safety instructions
okay
youve set rope
dont touch
jean clottes first scientist
inspect cave days discovery
five years retirement
served head scientific team
guide leads us first sloping tunnel
ends vertical drop cave floor
since film crew limited
maximum four
must perform technical tasks
addition time cave
severely restricted
take one light well
five past
one hour
apart time constrictions
allowed touch anything cave
ever step twofootwide walkway
use three flat cold light panels
powered battery belts
see made passageways
protected stalagmites
nice touch
inevitably moving along single file
film crew hiding places
get shot
first large chamber come
original entrance cave
prehistoric times rock slide
daylight must illuminated
left arrived inside cave
see entrance
archaeological entrance
people came cave level
like us ladder
cliff collapsed
weve got rubble cliff
outside see
inside
youve got dots
red dots
red dots saw first
came cave
big dots made palm hand
well big cave bear skull right
male probably
youll see many others
see big chamber really huge
biggest cave
paintings except right end
probably relevant
entrance still open
must light
put paintings really complete dark
see
cave bear painted black
paintings looked fresh
initial doubts authenticity
picture layer
calcite concretions
take thousands years grow
first proof forgery
beautiful horse
one beautiful cave
touching
looks done yesterday
look fresh looks technique
behind horse
two mammoths big mammoths
see cave bear scratches
cave bear scratches color
look like might made
years earlier
coming one great spots cave
famous panel horses
one size small recess
small hole
water comes gurgling
theres something like week rain
probably explains
animals painted around hole
one great works art world
paleolithic painters
play light shadows torches
could possibly looked something like
animals perhaps appeared moving living
note artists painted bison
eight legs suggesting movement
almost form protocinema
walls flat
threedimensional dynamic
movement utilized artists
upper left corner another multilegged animal
rhino right
seems also illusion movement
like frames animated film
painters cave seem speak us
familiar yet distant universe
seeing
part millions spatial points
today scientists mapped every single millimeter
cave using laser scanners
position every feature cave known
shape cave entirety
end end feet long
map basis
scientific projects done
working create new understanding cave
precision scientific methods
thats think main goal
main goal create stories
could happened cave past
like creating
phone directory manhattan
four million precise entries dream
cry night
hopes
families
youll well never know phone directory
definitely
never know past definitely lost
never reconstruct past
create representation
alre exists today
human
human
come cave
course things
background
background may ask
well used circus man
switched archaeology
circus
lion tamer
well mostly lion tamer
mostly unicycle juggling yeah
first time entered chauvet cave
chance get five days
powerful
every night dreaming lions
every day shock
emotional shock
mean im scientist human
five days decided go back cave
needed time relax take time
absorb
absorb yeah yeah
dreamt paintings lions
real lions
definitely
yeah
afraid dreams
afraid
afraid
feeling powerful things deep things
way understand things direct way
uh sorry
silence please
please dont move
going listen silence cave
perhaps even hear heartbeats
images memories
longforgotten dreams
heartbeat
ever able understand vision
artists across abyss time
aura melodrame landscape
could straight wagner opera
painting german romanticists
could connection
staging landscape operatic event
belong romanticists alone
stone age men might similar sense
inner landscapes seems natural
theres whole cluster paleolithic caves
right around
chauvet cave top cliff
chauvet cave also associated
natural feature
beautiful arch called pont darc
maybe pont darc mythology people
landmark mark also
imagination stories
mythology
important understand world
kind world
paleolithic people back
years ago europe
europe covered glaciers glacial europe
imagine climate dry cold sun also
important
place example
imagine woolly rhinos
mammoths along rivers
forest
megaloceros deers horses reindeers bisons
also ibex antelopes moving
rich
biomass part europe
important
development human also carnivores
imagine lions bears leopards
wolves foxes large numbers
among carnivores predators human
could set fires chauvet cave
theres evidence cast shadows
panels horses example
fire necessary look paintings
maybe towards staging people around
look flame moving light
imagine people dancing shadows
like fred astaire
fred astaire yes
think image dancing shadow
strong old images human representation
first representation walls
white wall black shadow
presence humans cave
fleeting like shadows
bear skulls everywhere
skulls belong cave bear
species like mammoth woolly rhino
vanished face earth long ago
tens thousands years patient water dripping
left thick coating calcite skull
appearance porcelain sculpture
menagerie bones
theres single human specimen
scientists determined humans never lived cave
used painting possibly ceremonies
michel philipe studied bones chauvet cave
caves constitute favorable place
preservation bones
result lot bear bones
overall represents finds
also wolves
two skulls several bones
ibexes
magnificent skull wet sand calcite
quite lovely
shine light
calcite crystals glisten
truly quite lovely
horses well
cave hyena
else
theres also eagle skeleton
golden eagle practically whole
may little recent
carried run water
wedged big rocks edge waterway
see bones spread
ten feet length
goal say bones
also try understand lived
moved transported
bears bring bones
several bones chewed little
could bears hyenas
scientists lodged
nearby sports complex
although special field
compare combine findings
interested work two
carole gilles explain youre
yeah oui
cave
trying reveal contours
underlying designs
hard follow naked eye
supposed touch wall
take series photos put together mosaic
trying achieve maximum detail
take transparency
put top photo
trace underlayers engravings
later return cave check contours
designs see
markings bears well
understand figure event
bear scratches
magnificent drawing mammoth done finger
scratches done mammoth
succession important
understand took place
computer one see three phases
first dates years back time
one bear scratched walls
second phase drawings
stretching eight feet height
therefore made stick followed main phase
sometime around years less
starts scraping wall
get white rock
first figures put place
two rhinos attacking one another
bottom
came three bulls
finally ended
series horses going top bottom
final phase adding beautiful horse
confronts viewers arrive cave
synthesis composition
kind dynamic circular movement
going bottom right
towards center like circle
obviously creates strong dynamic
reinforced
oblique movement horses
force contrast
fact theyve played contrast
shape wall
like easel
theyve used surface made use material
mixed material create strong impression
comparing paintings cave
seems certain horses panel
created one single individual
immediate vicinity horses
figures animals overlapping
striking point
cases like carbon dating
strong indications
overlapping figures drawn
almost years apart
sequence duration time
unimaginable us today
locked history
despite blurring time
anonymity artists
theres one individual singled
dominique baffier scholar paleolithic culture
right examines cluster palm prints
colleague valérie feruglio
currently working
large panel
covered positive handprints
weve able put forward evidence
number positions individual assumed
movements
started crouching stretched
reach way highest palm prints
panel comprised prints single man
must measured roughly six feet tall
single human
meter tall thats big
one person
une personne une personne
one person person measuring six feet
youll notice prints
significant detail
slightly crooked little finger
thats extraordinary
gives physical reality
prehistoric individual years ago
came cave us
even surprising
youll find traces deeper cavern
well able recognize crooked little finger
printed hand farther cave
follow mans path
madame baffier took us tour
serves custodian cave
rules engagement strict
entirely reasonable
given precious fragile nature
unique place
cave bear tracks
forepaws hind paws
longest cave bear tracks
currently known cave
sparkly
crystals glitter
junction panel panther
see drawing panther
one known paleolithic wall painting
date
weve arrived place
concretion growth important
ground walls see
rimstone calcite ridges covered everything
sparkling formation kind cascade
waves
take look bear vertebra
entirely coated calcite
held calcite crystals
front us wall
also overflowing draperylike concretion
kind niche
see traces ancient red paintings
washed away water seepage
find extremely original images
like insectshaped one
one shaped like butterfly
bird flight
also find rock pendant
hanging ceiling large small
coupled two vertical ocher stripes
follow pendants contours
front
large panel red paintings
also extremely intriguing item
mound stones
see didnt fall ceiling
prehistoric man grouped stones
know
panel first
little rhinoceros large horn
stripe abdomen
also whole series underneath
positive handprints
see hand
man printed palms
first room cave
recognize crooked little finger
words weve followed
animals
front part big rhinoceros
large horn
torch swipe marks
men would light way torch
wood burnt
would scrape torch wall
rekindle flame
traces fresh see
small fragments coal fallen
one tiny fragments
tested radiocarbon dating
torch swiped years ago
painting quite interesting
represents couple nowextinct cave lions
male
hes behind larger one
hes outlined single stroke
six feet length
front female
smaller seems rub flank male
representation cave lion
allowed us shed light mystery
archaeozoologists didnt know
whether cave lion mane
like lion today living africa
representation cave lion
years old
shows us didnt mane
look outline head clearly delineated
without doubt male
weve got scrotum right tail
one beautiful panels cave
along lion panel far end
see
technique prehistoric man
also see keen knowledge
animal world
tell us stories
ensemble horses
open mouths suggest animals whinnying
say images
become audible us
see two rhinos fighting
see signs fury towards
movement legs thrown forward
almost hear sound
horns colliding
movement fight
another story story lions
male courting female ready mating
sits growls
look hear female growling
shes raising lips
shes baring teeth
happy
finish
flight bison
hear hooves
make multiple legs indicating movement
escaping alcove
following auroch
madame baffier takes us
farthest chamber cave
mysterious chamber lions
serious level toxic co gas
emanating roots trees
seeps cave porous limestone
time even constricted location
possibility get close paintings
unfortunately
things wont able show film
wont able see
cant get closer
case absolutely marvelous paintings
farthest chamber grouping lions
especially case rock pendant
lower portion womans body
painted
pubic triangle
legs separate starting knee
diverge reminiscent
wellknown small early stone age statuettes
archaeological digs swabian jura germany
see part lower half female body
access side pendant
walk grounds
fragile
would destroy charcoal remains
would destroy tracks
left bears humans
youll make partial image
completed half female body
legs symmetrically
could see connected bison head
would somewhat human arm
years later
myth endured days
also find association
female bull
picassos drawings minotaur woman
partial representation
human entire cave
time
side rock pendant
must remain unreachable us
people created equally enigmatic
things left behind
practical items like flint tools
easily read
boxes
local museum filled
artifacts region
made excavation site
jeanmichel geneste lead us
handful findings chauvet cave
things preserved
two three boxes area
prepared
shed light enigmatic female image
prepared similar figurines regions
precious archaeology
see like willendorf venus
copy made limestone found austria
period
chauvet cave
lower part belly preserved
embedded bison
seems existed
visual convention
extending way beyond baywatch
male representation clearly found
lion man
comes site
hohlensteinstadel swabian alps
amazing mixture
anthropomorphic shape
human body head lion
spirit lion man
marriage
new
thats question ask reproduction
people lived valley
left behind great art
primitive beginning
slow evolution
rather burst onto scene like sudden explosive event
modern human soul awakened
even astonishing consider time
neanderthal man still roamed valley
must forms artistic expression
like music example
look around nearby regions
southwestern germany years ago
connected valley icefree corridor
also noted alp mountains covered
feet ice binding much water
sea level feet lower today
hunter could walked paris london
crossing dry seabed english channel
walking miles direction
would lead swabian alb germany
museum blaubeuren
find replicas bestknown paleolithic venuses
one venus hohle fels stands
found sensational age
venus hohle fels probably oldest depiction
kind figurative object know
earliest representation human
absolute root figurative depiction
know
later see range animals depicted
think animal depictions ivory
fabulous depictions grotte chauvet
mammoths lions
see clear connection
swabian finds depictions chauvet
whats also fascinating time
years ago
see evidence musical instruments
range personal ornaments
mythical depictions clearly show
people religious concept
evolving transformation humans animals
original statuette
carved mammoth tusk
look venus hohle fels bit closely
see clearly instance
figurine head right
instead head figurine ring
perhaps worn times
suspended string sort
also sexual attributes key
clearly link depiction
ideas reproduction fecundity sexuality
ideas absolutely essential
humanity also today
also important realize time
much europe occupied neanderthals
dealing critical phase
human evolution
two forms human beings testing boundaries
find
neanderthals
although theyre sophisticated
never kind symbolic artifact ever
small ivory mammoth
also found near hohle fels cave
beautiful horse comes region
also found fragments flutes
asked dr conard show us original
ivory flute really remarkable artifact
maria malina discovered years back
think whats extremely important
realize archeology today
heroic adventure spades picks
hightech scientific work
thats done incredible detail
really millimeter millimeter sediments removed
deposits age grotte chauvet
sites
years ago
detailed work allowed maria
identify whole range finds
able piece together
maybe explain worked
yes inventory
artifact pieces
pieces came
first years excavation
really small pieces
see picture
tiny ivory pieces
remained unexplained full three decades
pieces significant look
found pieces part finger holes
notches side
pieces thought already
could part ivory flute
course question important
flute made
see long axis
split going flute
inside two halves hollowed flute
little notches along axis along split
helped refit two halves together precise
flute one eight
far recovered area southwestern germany
caves paintings
yield many objects art
cave geissenkloesterle cave
many important findings ice age made
found little ivory statues bear mammoth
tiny mammoth lovely
part excavation team
people lived years back time
time cold
alp mountains covered glacier
meters thick
valley
reindeer mammoth passing
cold
thats reason im dressed like inuit
presume way
people ice age clothed
reindeer fur boots made reindeer fur
reindeer leather
otherwise couldnt stand cold
one important finds made cave
tiny flute made radius vulture
astonishing flute
pentatonic
tonality used hear today
like ill try play small tunes
first reconstructed instrument
tried play tunes came across ones
sounds little bit like starspangled banner
back france near chauvet cave
explorers using primal techniques
search stillhidden underground chambers
roam landscape
professional cave explorers
techniques finding underground chambers
air currents
use back hands cheeks
feel faint draft air
may coming cave
im trying things differently
habit using sense smell profession
try sniff smells
coming interior cave
didnt smell anything except exterior landscape
outside smell earth wild thyme ivy
smell range things
nothing specific related cavern
thats closed thousands years
personal technique design perfumes
matter trying experience
different manner
ive ive always created perfumes
notably president
french society perfumers
years
plans
build theme park tourists
precise replica cave
miles
replica may even contain recreation
odor prehistoric interior
evidently odor smell right
quite attenuated
subtle
many emanations imagination permits us
try reconstruct scene
scene odors years ago
animals would found
bears wolves perhaps even rhinoceroses man
presence lives meaning burnt wood resins
odors everything natural world
surrounds cave
go back imagination
herzog sense wonder
cave transforms
enchanted world imaginary
time space lose meaning
crystal formations take thousands years grow
artists cave never even saw
many started form
landslide sealed entrance
forbidden recess cave
theres footprint eightyearold boy
next footprint wolf
hungry wolf stalk boy
walk together friends
tracks made thousands years apart
well never know
dwarfed large chambers
illuminated wandering lights
sometimes overcome strange irrational sensation
disturbing paleolithic people
work
felt like eyes upon us
sensation occurred scientists
also discoverers cave
relief surface aboveground
back outside ask jeanmichel geneste
hunting techniques paleolithic people
millennia invention bow arrow
ohauvet oave aurignacian people
hunted lot really big games
hunted everywhere france europe
settlement found lot bones
reindeer bison horses sometime mammoths
developed specific hunting technology
example system aurignacian bone point
ingenious
bone point wooden shaft
piece bone point
strongly associated shaft
system using fork piece inside
strong
made developed
kill bison horses like
aggressive
also strong powerful
kind weapon spear thrown
hand like efficient
l suspect
beginning paleolithic
developed technology spear thrower
spear thrower beginning hook
sometime tooth piece antler
like one long handle
elongated arm gave lot power like
also time precision keep
give spear good direction
show
yes
see spear flint point
use necessary
small depression back spear
suspect sometimes used feathers
keep direction moment throw
try show kill horse
okay
efforts may look convincing
powerful weapon
spearheads found deeply embedded
shoulder blades horses mammoths
see fly
straight meters
stay
paleolithic man better guess
oh suspect
could really difficult
shot kill horse really
midapril
scientific research ended year
allowed full access cave
even restricted
single week four hours day
famous cave lascaux shut
breath scores tourists
caused mold grow walls
enter chauvet cave
aware may last opportunity
film inside
mystery minotaur female began unfold
guides allowed us mount small camera
stick reached
bison seems embrace sex naked woman
traditional people think
people paleolithic probably
two concepts change vision world
theyre concept fluidity concept permeability
fluidity means categories
man woman horse dont know tree et cetera
shift
tree may speak
man get transformed animal
way around given certain circumstances
concept permeability barriers
speak world
world spirits
wall talk us
wall accept us refuse us
shaman example send spirit
world supernatural
receive visit inside
supernatural spirits
put two concepts together
realize different life must
people way live
humans described many ways right
homo sapiens
still called homo sapiens
man knows
dont think good definition
dont know
dont know much
would think homo spiritualis
strongest hint something spiritual
religious ceremony cave
bear skull
placed dead center rock resembling altar
staging seems deliberate
skull faces entrance cave
around fragments charcoal found
potentially used incense
exactly took place
paintings could tell us
want understanding
must go outside cave
mean must start cave go outside
far outside
would go
well would say everywhere
look different culture
would good way better understand
different culture could coped rock art
example australia north america
south africa
aborigines australia
lived recently almost like stone age people
sure example used paint
create rock art
places think still
traditions creating rock art
well course changed
since beginning century
discovered
tell us different ways
looking rock art
way looking rock art
example
yeah sure course
north australia example
ethnographer field aborigine
informer
arrived rock shelter
rock shelter
beautiful paintings
decaying
aborigine started become sad
saw paintings decaying
region tradition
touching paintings time time
sat started touch paintings
ethnographer asked question
every western person would asked
painting
man answered
answer troubling
answered
painting
thats hand hand
spirit actually painting
hand spirit
yeah man part spirit
think paintings chauvet cave
somehow beginning modern human soul
constitutes humanness
humanness good adaptation
world
soc human society
needs adaptate landscape
beings animals
human groups
communicate something communicate
inscribe memory
specific hard things
like walls like pieces wood like bones
invention cromagnon
music
yes also things mythology music
invention figuration
figuration animals men things
way communication humans
future
evocate past transmit information
better language
oral communication
invention still world today
camera example
rhone river
one largest nuclear power plants france
chauvet cave located miles crow flies
beyond hills background
surplus warm water
used cool reactors
diverted half mile away create tropical biosphere
warm steam fills enormous greenhouses
site expanding
crocodiles introduced brooding jungle
warmed water cool reactor
man thrive
already hundreds
surprisingly
mutant albinos swim breed waters
thought born surreal environment
long ago ten thousands years back
glaciers feet thick
new climate steaming spreading
fairly soon albinos might reach chauvet cave
looking paintings make
nothing real
nothing certain
hard decide whether
creatures dividing
doppelgaengers
really meet
imaginary mirror reflection
today possibly crocodiles
look back abyss time
see paintings chauvet cave
