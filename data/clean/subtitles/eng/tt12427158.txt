that he should go
to a better school 
he doesn t want to be controlled 
who gives a fuck
about what he wants 
what does he need 
i don t know 
matter of fact  i do 
it s you 
like how 
you re too tough 
okay  what else 
i m listening 
maybe if you quiet down some 
he would actually hear
what you have to say 
okay 
i don t even remember
the last time i raised my voice 
he d do good at any school 
you used to like when i got spicy 
 try and be quiet  
 you should try and be quiet  
right 
quiet like when
you went missing for weeks 
and i sat here and said nothing 
 and never mind who you was with 
 see  there it go 
if i get any more quieter 
i won t even have a fucking voice at all 
i m not about to sit here
and argue with you 
that s real easy for you to say 
 cause you get to be the saint  right

while i m stuck here
fighting these wars all by myself 
  see how loud you re getting 
  what 
 well  then fucking show up for me  lucky

i wonder what d happen if i leave too 
you scared 
something s gonna happen 
i can feel it

 he doesn t have an  
 that s not the fucking point  lucky 
shit  i don t know  aight 
they s bound to come any fucking where 
take care of your moms  t 
where luck going 
and you   i ma say this one time 
you look at me when i m fucking talking 
it s either you go to that school 
or you find somewhere else to live 
you hear me 
 where to push
and where not to push 
but i ma take but so much 
and she gon  take but so much 
so we compromise 
it works out for you guys 
so  you gonna get married or 
  uh  
 all right  all right  all right 
that s a whole  nother show 
i m sorry  you had a comment  yes 
you say you do it for the attention 
there are other ways of getting attention 
doesn t it cost you a lot of friendships
and relationships  being a bitch 
well  it has cost me a lot
of friendships and a lot of relationships 
but i find in life that sometimes 
having a friend in yourself
is better than having  
worrying about having people
as your friends 
 cause no one s
gonna look out for you but you 
  and i ve learned that in life 
i ve looked out for people 
you know  but  
you seem to make some sense 
i mean  i m saying 
i have friends now 
  they re bitchy like me  so we get along 
we   i m serious 
we understand each other 
  and  like  i m generous 
 they got a little dog pound 
right  and i help  
i help out some of my family members 
as well as they help me 
but they also know
where to push my buttons
and where to go also  as paul said 
okay  yes 
i know i like to get what i want 
but i think there are other ways
to do that  
that only makes people 
come shoot some hoops with me 
i m about to go to the store 
come here 
you need some money 
 ma gave me some 
 here 
take it anyway 
a man should always have some money
in his pocket 
so  um  where you been at 
i needed some time to clear my head 
feels like it s been a lot longer
than that this time 
y all breaking up or something 
want to shoot 
your mother ever tell you how we met 
no 
she used to work at this coffee shop
that closed down a few years ago 
i used to get my hair cut
right across the street 
i d go in 
i d order me a bagel or whatever 
but i m still not sure
how i ma kick it to her 
and ended up telling her the truth 
that she was the most beautiful woman 
that i ever seen 
were you nervous 
i just felt like she should know 
but something told me to go back  right 
this is when i had my other bike 
a few days later 
i said   let me take you for a ride  
we been rocking ever since 
t 
don t get caught up in none of this shit
that you see around here 
have i ever 
took me too long to learn that 
i don t want to see you fall into
the same traps as me and your mother 
i want you
to make better choices than me 
when it comes to her 
when it comes to everything 
i  uh 
i got into the specialized high school 
oh  yeah

teenagers hate everybody 
but i do sense a little void in him 
first couple years of his life 
he ain t had nobody

maybe it s time for y all
to have that conversation 
give him some of the answers
that he been looking for

i never really knew where it came from 
or whether or not 
whether or not i deserved it 
maybe that s why i never 
i never fully gave it back

it s   it s terry wallace 
how long ago did this happen 
when   when i was little 
i was a social worker for years
