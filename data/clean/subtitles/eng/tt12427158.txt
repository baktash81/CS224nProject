maybe if you quiet down some
he would actually hear
what you have to say
okay
i dont even remember
the last time i raised my voice
hed do good at any school
you used to like when i got spicy
try and be quiet
you should try and be quiet
right
quiet like when
you went missing for weeks
and i sat here and said nothing
and never mind who you was with
see there it go
if i get any more quieter
i wont even have a fucking voice at all
im not about to sit here
and argue with you
thats real easy for you to say
cause you get to be the saint right
you get to be the saint
while im stuck here
fighting these wars all by myself
see how loud youre getting
what
well then fucking show up for me lucky

thats not the fucking point lucky
shit i dont know aight
theys bound to come anyfuckingwhere
take care of your moms t
where luck going
and you ima say this one time
you look at me when im fucking talking
its either you go to that school
or you find somewhere else to live
you hear me
where to push
and where not to push
but ima take but so much
and she gon take but so much
so we compromise
it works out for you guys
so you gonna get married or
uh
all right all right all right
thats a whole nother show
im sorry you had a comment yes
you say you do it for the attention
there are other ways of getting attention
doesnt it cost you a lot of friendships
and relationships being a bitch
well it has cost me a lot
of friendships and a lot of relationships
but i find in life that sometimes
having a friend in yourself
is better than having
worrying about having people
as your friends
cause no ones
gonna look out for you but you
and ive learned that in life
ive looked out for people
you know but
you seem to make some sense
i mean im saying
i have friends now
theyre bitchy like me so we get along
we im serious
we understand each other
and like im generous
they got a little dog pound
right and i help
i help out some of my family members
as well as they help me
but they also know
where to push my buttons
and where to go also as paul said
okay yes
i know i like to get what i want
but i think there are other ways
to do that
that only makes people
come shoot some hoops with me
im about to go to the store
come here
you need some money
ma gave me some
here
take it anyway
a man should always have some money
in his pocket
