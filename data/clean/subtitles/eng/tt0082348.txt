you kay be brave and honest
and merciful
as a knight should be
and you arthur be modest and true
and help your brother
to uphold the good name of morven
i remember my first joust
it looks far worse than it feels
camelyarde camelyarde
god send us a true king
we are unworthy
but the land bleeds the people suffer
we have sinned but on this easter day
when christ rose from the dead
may one knight here
through victory in arms find the grace
to draw the sword and be king
by my right of victory
by my blood
give me the power
all knights prepare and be ready
who would joust for the right
to draw the sword
from the stone
arthur where is kays sword
a good squire doesnt forget
his knights sword
i left it in the tent father
well hurry then and get it
stolen
ill see whats keeping him
well hurry youll miss your chance
your sword was stolen
but here is excalibur
kay

you must put it back
now try to draw it again arthur

let the boy try
let the boy try
come on arthur dont be afraid
we have our king thanks be to god
rise father please
i was your son before i became your king
if i am king
you are king
the more so
because you are not my son
and i am not your father
not my father
then kay is not my brother
merlin the magician brought you to me
when you were newly born
and bade me raise you as my own
at first i did so because i feared merlin
but later
because i loved you
who is my true father
only merlin can tell you that
and who is merlin
i am merlin
whose son am i
you are the son of uther and igrayne
you are king arthur
we havent forgotten you
what trickery is this
hes trying to foist
a fatherless boy upon us
do you want a bastard as a king
lord leondegrance join us against the boy
i saw what i saw
the boy drew the sword
if a boy has been chosen
a boy shall be king
no i challenge that
the sword has been drawn
are you with us or against us
against you
why have you done this to me
because you were born to be king
what does it mean to be king
you will be the land
and the land will be you
if you fail the land will perish
as you thrive the land will blossom
why
because you are king
no
what are you afraid of
i dont know
shall i tell you whats out there
yes please
the dragon
a beast of such power
that if you were to see it whole
and complete in a single glance
it would burn you to cinders
where is it
it is everywhere
it is everything
its scales glisten in the bark of trees
its roar is heard in the wind
and its forked tongue strikes like
like lightning yes thats it
how can i
what shall i must i
do nothing
be still sleep
rest in the arms of the dragon
dream
excalibur its part of the dragon too
oh yes
oh you learn quickly
thats good
i like that
what kind of man was my father
oh he was brave he was strong
he was a great knight
was he a great king
well he was rash
he never learned
how to look into mens hearts
least of all his own
you loved him
well it is easy to love folly in a child
merlin will you help me to be wise
not to be rash
where are you going
where do you think
you have a kingdom to rule
but how i dont know how
you knew how to draw the sword
from the stone
that was easy
was it
i couldnt have done it
you couldnt
youre the king not i
but where to start
well what do you think has happened
since you ran off
sir ector and kay
they must be waiting all this time
most of the great knights were against me
except leondegrance of camelyarde
but if he supports me
the others will turn against him
even now they lay siege to his castle
i need him we must help him
there you are
that was easy too wasnt it
we have to get back
thats it
now
there they are
well you go and show them
arthur i knew you wouldnt fail us
go on
i picked out a horse for you
all these men are loyal
now what do you want us to do
we waited here for you
any man who would be a knight
and follow a king follow me
where to where are we going
leondegrance his castle is under siege
guenevere get back
youre beaten leondegrance
get the hook
throw the rope
thats good
thats it
now round the other side
uryens is attacking
go on
father
hold on hold on
take the knights in the moat
hold them off
im going for the ladder
father look
its the boy king
behind you
swear faith to me
and you shall have mercy
i need battle lords such as you
a noble knight swear faith to a squire
never never
you are right im not yet a knight
you uryens will knight me
then as knight to knight
i can offer you mercy
whats this
whats this
keep it uryens
in the name of god
saint michael and saint george
i give you the right to bear arms
and the power to meet justice
that duty i will solemnly obey
as knight and king
i never saw this
rise king arthur
i am your humble knight
and i swear allegiance
to the courage in your veins
so strong it is
its source must be uther pendragon
i doubt you no more
it didnt hurt too much did it
no
ive sewn my fathers wounds
more than once
careful youll tear them open
youll have to stay still and rest
how long
a few days
oh no what is it
the stitches
its all right
come on come on dance
a king must marry after all
so it seems
i love her if only shed be my queen
merlin can you make her love me
now look
i once stood exposed
to the dragons breath
so a man could lie one night
with a woman
it took me nine moons to recover
and all for this lunacy called love
this mad distemper
that strikes down both beggar and king
never again
never
who will i marry then
you can tell me that at least
what do you see
oh guenevere
and a beloved friend who will betray you
youre not listening your heart is not
love is deaf as well as blind
you have a land to quell before you can
start all this hair pulling
and jumping about
ive made these only for you
ive mixed into them things
that will heal you but not too quickly
and theyll make you a little sleepy
so you cant escape
whats in them
it is an ancient mixture
soft unborn grains
flavored with rose petals
the rest is secret
looking at the cake is like
looking at the future
until you have tasted it
what do you really know
and then of course its too late
too late
we have won battles against armies
and now one man defeats all my knights
hes a mighty opponent
a hard man
ill go myself
the king must not engage
in single combat ill go again
no i will
merlin who is this knight
look at him
so beautiful
so quick
remember
theres always something cleverer
than yourself
move aside this is the kings road
and the knights you joined arms against
were his very own
i await the king himself
his knights are in need of training
i am king and this
is excalibur
sword of kings from the dawn of time
who are you what do you seek
i am lancelot of the lake
from across the sea
and i have yet to find a king
worthy of my sword
that is a wild boast
you lack a knights humility
not a boast sir but a curse
for i have never met my match
in joust or duel
move aside
i will not
you must retreat
or prove your worth in the test of arms
under the eyes of god
then may he give me the strength
to unhorse you
and send you with one blow
back across the sea
then come across sir
you joust well sir
i offer you another lance
yes yes another lance
sword
yield sir
i have the advantage
i will not
fight me on your horse or on foot
but fight me your avoidance mocks me
i sought only not to harm you
your rage has unbalanced you
you sir would fight to the death
against a knight who is not your enemy
for a stretch of road
you could easily ride around
so be it to the death
excalibur
i call
on your power
merlin what have i done
you have broken
what could not be broken
hope is broken
my pride broke it
my rage broke it
this excellent knight
who fought with fairness and grace
was meant to win
i used excalibur to change that verdict
i have lost for all time
the ancient sword of my fathers
whose power was meant
to unite all men
not to serve the vanity of a single man
i am nothing
the lady of the lake
take it
excalibur
is it true
take it quickly
thanks be to god youre alive
i the best knight in the world bested
this is a great day
for my search is over my king
make me your champion
but your life and lands are far from here
i give up my castle and my lands
here is my domain
within this metal skin
and i pledge all that i still own
muscle bone blood
and the heart that pumps it
and a great heart it is
sir lancelot you will be my champion
we killed every one of them
burnt their ships
lancelot howd you fare in the north
we spared a few to tell what fate they met
at arthurs hands
and you uryens
victory
lot and you
we drove the invaders back into the sea
gawain you
the east is ours again
the west is free and with us
the wars are over
one land one king
peace
stand back
be silent
be still
thats it
and look upon this moment
savor it
rejoice with great gladness
great gladness
remember it always
for you are joined by it
you are one under the stars
remember it well then this night
this great victory
so that in the years ahead you can say
i was there that night
with arthur the king
for it is the doom of men that they forget
your wisdom has forged this ring
hereafter
so that we remember our bonds
we shall always come together
in a circle
to hear and tell of deeds good and brave
i will build a round table
where this fellowship shall meet
and a hall about the table
and a castle about the hall
and i will marry
and the land will have an heir
to wield excalibur
knights of the round table
its sir lancelot
lancelot welcome
this is a great day
everything is prepared
well leave at dawn
guenevere
here is arthurs greatest knight
come to escort you to the king
they want me to ask you if
any one of them could win your heart
im a fighting man
im sworn to the quest
but surely there must be some lady
somewhere in the world who inspires you
there is one
who is she
oh go on tell me
you
youre teasing me
i will love you always
i will love you as my queen
and as the wife of my best friend
and while you live
i will love no other
by the blood of jesus christ
i join you in marriage
man to woman
king to queen
arthur to guenevere
dont you know me lord merlin
morgana of cornwall
you have your fathers eyes
i remember you
when my brother arthur was born
you came and took him away
and now you leave his wedding
because i am a creature like you
what is the stone that burns
sulphur to mix with mercury
what is that root
mandrake
the essence of it
can prolong the act of love
and if too much is taken
pain and death
thats it
oh you do know something of the art
do you have the sight
do you see the future
sometimes i dream of things
that come to pass
look now
what do you see
what will be
i see a castle of silver and gold
up there
that plan is wellknown
youll have to do better than that
it is a lonely way you know
the way of the necromancer
yes to know too much
lacrimae mundi
the tears of the world
but the power the joy
moments fleeting moments
i can ease your loneliness
let me help you teach me
the days of our kind are numbered
the one god comes to drive out
the many gods
the spirits of wood and stream
grow silent
its the way of things yes
its a time for men and their ways
run home to your mother boy
take me with you
i want to be a knight
ill find food for you
did you like the rabbit
do you know what it means
to serve a knight who serves a king
jump up
ill run
listen boy
its more than 20 days from here
twenty days the worlds not that big
whats that
camelot the kings castle
cavalry
lancelot welcome
hey lot
hey lancelot great to see you
will you train this lad to be my squire
wholl give me my armor and sword
kitchen knives and greasy spits
shall be your weapons boy
to the kitchens
look
staying
theres a meeting of the round table
no i cant
sorry old fellow
whatre you doing here
this is no place for an old man
i built it dullard
all on your own
yes and for the likes of you it seems
oh well then you can tell me
the way to the kitchen
follow your nose
im dreaming
i must be dreaming
get away from there boy
lancelot doesnt come once more
but we must fill his cup
to show our love for him
watch guenevere
remember what i told you about them
your eyes never leave me merlin
cant i acknowledge beauty
cant you acknowledge love
perhaps you ache
for what youve never known
perhaps you lust for what you cannot have
cannot have but you promised
your secrets
you said youd show me everything
ive shown you too much already
are you counselor to the king
or to my sister
at your service sir
then answer me this
for years peace has reigned in the land
crops grow in abundance theres no want
every one of my subjects enjoys
his portion of happiness and justice
tell me merlin have we defeated evil
it seems we have
good and evil
there never is one without the other
where hides evil then in my kingdom
always
where you never expect it
always
i know where
where sir gawain
i cannot say
you must speak your heart
you sit at the round table
where is this evil
hes our best and bravest
why then is he never here
without lancelot this table is nothing
is there anyone here
who doesnt think him a god
and now to be driven from us
by a womans desire
in the idleness that comes with peace
i see that gossip has bred its own evil
i will forgive your
hasty words
come
drink from lancelots cup
and partake of his goodness
you dare accuse the queen gawain
i do
i protest my innocence
were i not king i would make you pay
with your life for what youve said
will you not champion me
i cannot
im your king
and i must be your judge in this
lancelot must do it
he also stands accused
i decree
that at sunrise two days from now
the champions will meet
and the truth shall be known
for by the law of god
no knight who is false
can win in combat
with one who is true
you are the people i love best in the world
then why cant you defend me
the law
my laws must bind everyone
high and low or theyre not laws at all
you are my husband
i must be king first
before husband
if need be
before love
lord we are innocent
but not in our hearts
to hold her once in my arms
i would sacrifice everything
honor
truth my sacred trust god
save me from myself
purge me of this love
so that i can defend her
i fight against myself
oh god
my lord the sun is upon the field
the queen has no champion
i demand justice as is my right
so it is
let me champion the queen
since no knight comes forward
i demand justice
is there not one of you
let me through
boy kneel
in the name of god
of saint michael
and saint george
i make you a knight
rise sir
perceval
perceval
lancelot
its my task perceval
to prove the queens innocence
i yield to your mercy lancelot
the queen is innocent
look at your laws now
look what they have done
save him merlin
he has no will to live
bring him back whatever the cost
whatever the cost do it
so be it
will he live
oh yes
will guenevere
yes
merlin will i ever have a son
yes
no riddles nothing but a simple yes
that frightens me
but a king should be afraid
arthur always
of the enemy waiting everywhere
in the corridors of his castle
on the deer paths of his forest
or in a more tangled forest
in here
welcome welcome back
take your place again lancelot
my lord
look sir lancelot hes back
no more going
they miss the battlefield
i think we do too
we have lost our way arthur
it is not easy for them without
the hard teaching of war and quest
it is only your example lancelot
that binds them all
which is the greatest quality
of knighthood
courage compassion loyalty
humility
what do you say merlin
the greatest
well they blend like the metals we mix
to make a good sword
no poetry just a straight answer
which is it
all right then
truth thats it
yes it must be truth above all
when a man lies
he murders some part of the world
you should know that
i must take my rest in the forest
hasnt merlin mended your wound
it is deep
youll be sorely missed heal yourself
and come back
do you still have the sight merlin
are they together
yes
you warned me of this all those years ago
what must i do now kill them
i can tell you nothing more
my days are ended
the gods of once are gone forever
its a time for men
its your time arthur
i need you now more than ever
no
this is the moment
that you must face at last
to be king alone
and you old friend
will i see you again
no
there are other worlds
this one is done with me
thats it
bat wing snake skin
is this all youve learned morgana
to deal in potions and petty evil
and where have your meddling arts
brought the world
to the edge of ruin
im worn thin and threadbare
ive tried to guide men
or meddled in their affairs
as you would have it for far too long
the time has come for me to go
forgive me where are you going
whence i came
merlin take me with you
the charm of making
you swore to pass it to me
you think youre ready
are you worthy
i am
i am
then follow me
what is this place
here you enter the coils of the dragon
here my power was born
here all things are possible
and all things meet their opposites
the future
and the past
desire
and regret
knowledge
and oblivion
love
oh yes
look
more
show me more
show me the dragon
tell me the sacred charm of making
even though such knowledge would burn
and blind you
then burn me
look into the eyes of the dragon
and despair
i destroy you i consign you to oblivion
arthur
excalibur into the spine of the dragon
the sword the land
yes merlin thats it
set the world to rights
call the dragon
mend the sword
speak the charm of making
you fool
you thought you would trap me
you are trapped yourself by the same
sorcery you used to deceive my mother
youre nothing
youre not a god youre not a man
i shall find a man and give birth to a god
the king without a sword
the land without a king
love me
love me
guenevere
forget and love me
i have conceived a son my king
my brother
i could kill you now brother
but i want you to live
to see our son be king
god save us from morgana
and save us from her unholy child
is he dead
no he lives
a knight
help us
help us please
were dying our children are dying
where is the king
please help us
we must find what was lost
the grail
only the grail can restore leaf and flower
search the land
the labyrinths of the forests
to the edge of
within
only the grail can redeem us
search
seek
where do we look for it
portents
signs

the king has spoken
i will ride forth in the name of that quest
we will find this grail or die
have you found it the grail
its me perceval
we will never find it
gawain
you seek what arthur wants
that thing they call the grail
i do
then follow me
they were looking for it too
but they werent good enough
mordred my lovely clever boy
you have crossed the great wasteland
you are burning with thirst
drink
for ten years and a day you have searched
is it so long
and tell me
have you found what you seek
i have found nothing but sorrow and death
i never thought to hear laughter again
till i saw this boy
he promised me the grail
is it here
you have searched too hard
take your ease
drink and join with me
bors youre here
meliot you too
you are alive
there is no grail
as these good knights have found
they serve me instead
there are many pleasures in the world
many cups to drink from
and they shall be yours drink
no
hes no good mother
take him to the tree
no
there is a grail
what is the secret of the grail
who does it serve
arthur the secret was in my grasp
i failed you
when am i going to be king mother
when the time comes
i will send you to your father
you will take what is yours
and then you will be king
no spear no sword
no arrow
no lance no blade
no weapon forged by man
will harm you
whilst you wear this armor
any message for your dear brother
my father
you are my message
keep a distance mordred
i have come to claim what is mine father
show yourself
i cannot give you the land
only my love
thats the only thing of yours i dont want
the quest knights have failed
theyre all dead
you are dead too
i shall come back
and take camelot by force
uryens
renounce the king and ill spare your life
never
so be it
uryens
i was afraid to help you
perceval never give up the quest
i saw the grail uryens
it was in my grasp
i failed
you are the last of us try again
i am not worthy
you mustyou
listen
follow
they call you
all around is death
death everywhere
all of you will come to death
for it is our constant companion
through life as we trudge
through this weary
and tragic scene
of the valley of the shadow of death
look at the great knight
peace and plenty they promised
but what did they give us instead
famine and pestilence
lancelot is it you
and death
because of their pride
and because of their sin
its me perceval
god has left the world
they made themselves god
and christ has abandoned us
lancelot wont you help us
come back to us lancelot
arthur needs you
lancelot
i cant give up hope lancelot
its all i have
what is the secret of the grail
who does it serve
you my lord
who am i
you are my lord and king
you are arthur
have you found the secret
that i have lost
yes
you and the land are one
you and the land are one drink
i am wasting away
i cannot die and i cannot live
drink from the chalice
you will be reborn and the land with you
perceval
i didnt know how empty was my soul
until it was filled
arthur
ready my knights for battle
they will ride with their king once more
i have lived through others far too long
lancelot carried my honor
and guenevere my guilt
mordred bore my sins
my knights have fought my causes
now my brother
i shall be king
guards
knights
squires
prepare for battle
guenevere
accept my forgiveness
and put your heart to rest
weve suffered too long
i have always loved you and still love you
i loved you as king
sometimes as husband
but one cannot gaze too long at the sun
forgive me my wife if you can
i was not born to live a mans life
but to be the stuff of future memory
the fellowship was a brief beginning
a fair time that cannot be forgotten
and because it will not be forgotten
that fair time may come again
now once more i must ride
with my knights
to defend what was
and the dream of what could be
i kept it
i never dared to hope all these years
that it was in your keeping
i have often thought
that in the hereafter of our lives
when i owe no more to the future
and can be just a man
that we may meet
and you will come to me
and claim me yours
and know that i am your husband
it is a dream i have
it is only me and my son
all other knights of the dukedom
have rallied to mordred
whats that smoke yonder
that is mordreds army
then let us camp here tonight
and fight tomorrow
merlin
if only you were at my side
my old friend to give me courage
there are no war tricks
that will fool mordred and morgana
more than i ever did i need you now
where are you merlin
if only you could see me
wield excalibur once more
arthur
where have you been these many years
is it true that morgana
stories
you brought me back
your love brought me back
back to where you are now
in the land of dreams
are you just a dream
a dream to some
a nightmare to others
kay wake up my brother
i was dreaming
of merlin
yes he spoke to me
i dreamed of him too
merlin lives
he lives in our dreams now
he speaks to us from there
he said i would fight bravely tomorrow
i have returned enchantress
you are beautiful
yes
magnificent
have you used up all the magic
you stole from me
to keep yourself so young
have you any magic left
to do battle with merlin
nothing to fear from an old man
you vanquished long ago
who only wants to see
how powerful youve become
you see morgana
you made me into a dream
a shadow
a shadow
you must be greater than ever i was
i once released the dragons breath
so uther could lie with your mother
and beget a king
it almost destroyed me
but i expect you could do it quite easily
couldnt you
i see no mist
have your powers faded too
the charm
thats it
use the charm
have you forgotten the charm of making
use it
yes use it
thats it
oh good
oh thats grand
thats better than i ever was
careful
it can damage your beauty
a fog is rising
fog
that cannot be
my mother has a sense for such things
she said there would be no fog
it will stand against us in battle
merlin
where are you where are you
mother
my dear sweet boy
where are they
listen
they wont know
how few we are in the fog
well use the old ways
speed up horse
theyre attacking from behind us
turn about
look to the rear
you dogs move
there are too many
we cant hold them
lancelot is it you
is it true
it is
lancelots with us
hes back hes with us
oh my god
arthur
arthur
forgive
my salvation is to die
a knight of the round table
you are that and much more
you are its greatest knight
you are what is best in men
it is the old wound my king
it has never healed
guenevere
is she queen again
she is lancelot
the fog is lifting
no perceval
come father
let us embrace at last
perceval
take excalibur
find a pool
of calm water
throw the sword into it
no
obey me perceval
do it and return
when you cast it in
what did you see
i saw nothing
but the wind on the water
my king i couldnt do it
excalibur cannot be lost
other men
do as i command
