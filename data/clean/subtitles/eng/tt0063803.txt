woman  sounds like a nasty fellow 
j  r  who 
  the man with the    the indian 
  cicatrice  spanish for  scar   yeah 
he was more nasty
than wayne could ever get 
  but then again  he was a bad guy

   john wayne could get pretty
nasty too  when he wanted to be 
wait  was that the picture where jeffrey
hunter is supposed to be trading rugs

well  what is it 
  another guy

nothing like that 
well  all right  then what 
anyway  when   
well   
   a few years ago 
i was going with a boy 
he was nice 
he always acted like a gentleman 
well  we used to go for drives 
and the last time we went 
he seemed different  nervous 
in fact  he hardly talked 
there was a long road   
   and he pulled up into a clearing 
i didn t think much of it 
we had never really necked   
   so i figured he was gonna try 
the radio was loud 
i remember that about the radio 
 moaning 
 screams 
i felt dirty  i felt i wasn t
as good as anyone else 
i felt ashamed 
i couldn t even talk  i didn t talk 
i love you 
and i don t wanna lose you 
with you it ll be the first time 
i can t  uh   
i can t understand 
i mean  if anyone else
hears a story like that   
   well  how could they believe it 
but   
   you re not anyone else 
that s right 
i m not anyone else 
how could i believe you 
well  how could i believe you 
how can i believe that story 
huh

how do i know you didn t go
through the same story with him 
well  look

and don t even know what he s like 
you let him take you out on some
goddamn road and you don t mind it 
it just    it doesn t   
it just doesn t seem real  does it 
it just doesn t make any sense 
  it s true

road and you don t even mind it
