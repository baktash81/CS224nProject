  i got it 
good morning  gentlemen 
and welcome to another season
of indians baseball 
i know it may not seem the same
without donald here 
but i promise you 
by the end of this season 
we will have made history 
unfortunately  there are
some in the press who feel that
 the ex showgirl wife of donald phelps
 has no business being the owner
of a major league baseball team   
spring training begins in two weeks 
here s a list of the players
we ll be inviting to camp 
i never heard of half of these guys 
and the ones i do know
are way past their prime 
most of these guys never had a prime 
the facts are  we lost
our two best players to free agency 
we haven t won a pennant
in over 35 years 
we haven t placed higher than fourth
in the last 15 
obviously  it s time for some changes 
  this guy here is dead 
  cross him off  then 
spring training starts on the 1st 
how do you think the indians
will do this year 
it doesn t look too good 
these guys don t look too fucking good 
oh  hi  charlie  come in  have a seat 
i m glad you called me in 
i m still unclear
about a couple of things 
oh  really  like what 
well  if i m the gm 
who s gonna be the manager 
i was thinking of lou brown 
who s lou brown 
he s managed the toledo mud hens
of the international league
for the last 30 years 
i think he ll fit right in
with our team concept 
what exactly is our team concept 
that s what i wanted
to talk to you about  charlie 
i want to put together a team
that ll help us relocate to miami 
what do you mean 
some of these guys
are furniture movers 
i m serious about this  charlie 
it s no secret
i ve never liked cleveland much 
the stadium s falling apart 
we don t draw dick  the weather s lousy 
another couple years of this 
and i m gonna have to start
feeding cha cha real dog food 
mrs  phelps  you just can t
up and move a team on a whim 
it s hardly a whim 
miami s offered
to build us a new stadium 
62 000 capacity 
45 vip boxes 
and for me  a mansion in boca raton 
plus free membership in
the palm beach polo and country club 
now  no other franchise in baseball
can match that deal 
the league will never let us
leave cleveland 
we got a lease with the city 
the lease says
we have the right to move
if the attendance falls below 800 000
for the year 
paragraph 40  line 17 
if we play bad enough  we should
be able to come in under that 
what are you saying 
you want us to lose 
no  we ve been losing 
what i want is for us to finish dead last 
  yeah 
  hello  jake 
this is charlie donovan 
the new gm of the cleveland indians 
yeah 
we d love for you
to come to spring training
for a shot at this year s club 
  is that you  talbert 
  what 
this isn t very funny  you know 
i m hung over 
my knees are killing me 
and if you re gonna pull this shit 
at least you could have said
you were from the yankees 
tire world 
hello  lou  this is charlie donovan
of the cleveland indians 
how would you like to manage
the indians this year 
i don t know 
what do you mean  you don t know

in the big leagues 
let me think it over  will you  charlie

i need a catcher  jake 
somebody who can lead this team
on the field 
so  i want the absolute truth here 
are you 100  
yeah  would i bullshit you
about something like that 
you better 
if you wanna make this team 
second base 
shit 
hold it  hold it 
well  you may run like mays 
but you hit like shit 
with your speed 
you should hit the ball on the ground
and be legging them out 
every time i see you hit one in the air 
you owe me 20 pushups 
hey  no problem 
shit 
all right  vaughn 
they tell us you re a pitcher 
you re sure not much of a dresser 
we wear caps and sleeves
at this level  son 
understood 
all right  let s see what you can do 
  nice velocity 
  sounded like it 
jesus 
how much 
96 
better teach this kid some control
before he kills somebody 
come on  dorn 
get in front of the damn ball 
don t give me this olé bullshit 
look  i took one of those
in the eye last year 
i m not about to lose my sight 
i m deeply moved 
every time you play one off your hips 
you owe me 40 sit ups 
what 
jesus  this guy hits a ton 
how come nobody else
picked up on him 
okay  eddie  that s enough fastballs 
throw him some breaking balls 
lou  i want a word with you here 
sure 
about those sit ups you want me to do 
i got it right here in my contract 
says i don t have to do any calisthenics
i don t feel are necessary 
so  what do you think about that 
two hundred pushups  how am i
supposed to hit if i can t lift my arms 
shit 
the way i played today 
i wouldn t be surprised
if they red tagged me already 
what do you mean 
you get a red tag on your locker 
it means the manager wants to see you
because you just died
and went down to the minors 
hey  don t worry  kid 
they ain t gonna cut anybody
the first day 
what s that shit on your chest 
crisco 
bardahl 
vagisil 
any one of  em will give you
another 2 to 3 inches drop
on your curve ball 
 course  if the umps
are watching me close 
i just rub a little jalapeño
inside my nose  get it running 
then if i need to load the ball up a little 
i just wipe my nose 
you put snot on the ball 
i haven t got an arm like yours 
i gotta put anything on it i can find 
someday you will  too 
qué pasa there  pedro 
bats  they are sick 
i can no hit curve ball 
straight ball  i hit it very much 
curve ball  bats are afraid 
i ask jobu to come  take fear from bats 
i offer him cigar and rum 
he will come 
hey  you know  you might think about
taking jesus christ as your savior 
instead of fooling around
with all this stuff 
shit  harris 
jesus  i like him very much 
but he no help with curve ball 
you trying to say
jesus christ can t hit a curve ball 
okay  harris 
let s not start a holy war here 
i wouldn t leave that rum sitting around
out here with this group 
is very bad to steal jobu s rum 
is very bad 
sí  sí  pedro 
attaboy  dorn 
way to get in front of that ball 
that s the ticket 
gracias 
okay 
third base 
  shit 
  jesus 
he s safe 
damn 
jeez 
he s going 
  come on 
  out 
  final cut down day  right 
  afraid so 
i don t wanna go in there 
yeah  look  whatever happens 
you just keep it to yourselves
until you get out of the clubhouse 
you don t wanna celebrate
in front of guys who just died 
yeah  but what if
we re one of the deceased  huh 
come on  jake  it s only your life 
yes  yes  yes 
i got news for you  mr  brown 
you haven t heard the last of me 
you may think i m shit now 
but someday 
you re gonna be sorry that you cut me 
i m gonna catch on somewhere else 
and every time that i pitch against you 
i m gonna stick it up your fucking ass

  way to go  cerrano 
  god damn it 
  jesus 
  let s go  go 
hello again  everybody 
harry doyle here  welcoming all you
friends of the feather
to another season of indians baseball 
a lot of new faces in chief wahoo s
tribe this year
as they take on the defending
american league champs 
the new york yankees 
and hopefully  we ll have some
of the names that go with those faces
before their first at bat 
anyway  listen to the roar of the crowd
as the indians take the field 
yes  sir 
they love this club here in cleveland 
just a reminder  fans 
about die hard night
coming up here at the stadium 
free admission to anyone
who was actually alive
the last time the indians won a pennant 
here s to the thrill of defeat  charlie 
keltner delivers  here s a swing 
and a high fly ball to center field 
hayes under it 
hey  makes a basket catch 
willie mays style 
and the side is retired 
all right  way to look out there  great 
nice catch  hayes 
don t ever fucking do it again 
  all right  let s go  let s get it going 
  let s go 
bottom of the first 
and willie mays hayes
to lead it off for the wigwammers 
a lot of people say you can tell
how the season s gonna go
by the first hitter of the year 
brewster into the wind 
and comes to the plate 
oops 
hey  here s a hot shot toward the hole 
rudiya knocks it down  fires to first 
late  hayes beat it 
hey  give rudiya credit
for sacrificing his body on that racket 
that guy s got a family to think about 
so  hayes becomes
the first indian in 15 years
to lead off the season with a hit 
really knocked the crap out of that one 
oh  i plan to get
at least a double out of this 
i bought 100 of these 
one for every base i m gonna steal 
shit 
well  maybe things will turn around
a little for the indians this year 
now batting  number seven 
catcher jake taylor 
excuse me  gotta take my first step
toward the hall of fame 
my ass 
we don t know where hayes
played last year 
but i m sure he did a hell of a job 
brewster ready from the stretch 
hayes with a good lead 
you look real sharp 
but it s hard to steal second base
with your shoe untied 
quick move to first  he got him 
hayes is picked off 
well  so much for that 
personally  i think we got hosed
on that call 
nice going  don t bounce the damn ball 
nice throw  dickhead 
strike 
son of a bitch 
coming through  i   
oh  shit 
top of the sixth  and rookie sensation
ricky vaughn on the pitch now 
you can close the book on keltner 
thank god 
relax  rookie 
we re only four runs down 
we re still in this game 
you take it to  em 
  let s go 
  all right 
look  man  a guy gets to second 
first sign indicator 
vaughn  a juvenile delinquent
in the off season 
in his major league debut 
i m gonna light your ass up  meat 
vaughn into the wind up
in his first offering 
just a bit outside 
he tried the corner and missed 
ball four  ball eight 
low  and vaughn has walked
the bases loaded
on 12 straight pitches 
boy  how can these guys
lay off pitches that close 
fuck 
wild thing
you make my heart sing
you walk everything
taylor  what are you doing
back up here 
i couldn t cut it in the mexican league 
how s your wife and my kids 
vaughn in deep trouble here
with clue haywood 
last year s american league
home run champ at the plate 
vaughn kicks  fires 
here is a swing  and a drive
toward left field  and deep  oh  boy 
no way  no way  too high  too high 
it is gone off the reservation 
a grand slam home run for haywood 
looked like a strike  anyway 
where are you going 
 too high  
what does that mean   too high  
too high  i thought 
so  vaughn is off to a rocky start 
as haywood clears the bases
with one swing 
not  too high    too hard   right 
  at first  it was really high 
  who gives a shit  it s gone 
  want me to go get him 
  nah  let s see how he reacts 
well  brown  apparently 
is going to stay with vaughn here 
as the indians trail now 
eight to nothing 
coleman steps in  a 281 lifetime hitter 
taylor with a sign 
vaughn into his motion  and the pitch 
uh oh 
interesting 
about time  it s eight nothing 
you  you re gone 
  what 
  you heard me  you re gone 
he was right on top of the plate 
get him out of here 
he s horse shit 
i think you can go get him now 
the ball slipped out of my hand 
it was an accident 
you threw at him intentionally 
  kiss my ass 
  you re gone 
  you re full of shit  fuck you 
  get out of here  rookie 
why don t you blow me  ump 
you re gone 
all right  coleman  take it easy 
accidents will happen 
you show a lot of heart
shaking it off like this 
fuck you  taylor 
  he done hurt him  hurt himself 
  come on 
don t even think about it  coleman 
the fucking wall  you pansy 
hard and high 
they succeeded at getting the object
that they were trying to establish 
because of the trajectory of the ball 
it looked way too high 
so  a tough start for the erie warriors 
as they drop a heartbreaker
to the yankees  nine to nothing 
post game show is brought to you by   
christ  i can t find it  the hell with it 
hello  cuyahoga sheet metal 
yeah  you wouldn t happen to have
someone working there
named lynn westland  would you 
nah  nobody here by that name 
didn t think so 
jake  you shouldn t have come here 
i was wondering
why you d give an old friend
a bum phone number 
  let s talk in my office  okay 
  i don t wanna talk in your office 
i told you  i don t think it s a good idea
that we see each other 
why not 
because we don t have
anything in common 
sometimes i wonder if we ever did 
what are you talking about 
we were both athletes  world class 
hot for each other 
what more could we have in common 
i stopped being an athlete
three years ago  jake 
books are my life now 
don t you dare laugh 
in two years  i put together
one of the best special collection
departments in the country 
what is this  you re still sore
i never read moby dick 
you never read anything i asked you to 
all right  i ll check it out now 
is this the whale section 
i ll bet what s his name at the restaurant
read it 
tom  his name s tom 
and keep your voice down 
what do you see in this guy 
well  he s stable  intelligent 
and i never found him in bed
with a stewardess 
that s because no stewardess
would have him 
hey  wouldn t you rather be
with someone who s in demand 
oh  god  you know  jake 
it s just like always 
you don t take anything seriously 
everything s a joke to you 
oh  come on  man  for christ s sake 
i m just trying to loosen things up 
i m getting frostbite here 
tom and i
are getting married in the fall 
oh  god  lynn  that s crazy 
i had plans for us 
  plans 
  yeah 
how can you say stuff like that 
i haven t seen you in three years 
you never even wrote me a letter 
well  i m sorry about that 
but i wasn t exactly proud
of my situation 
come on  you never thought
about me at all while i was gone 
yeah  jake  not so loud 
what about the three nights we spent
on the beach in veracruz 
you ever have nights like that
with mr  briefcase 
what about the night you had in detroit
with miss fuel injection 
well  what was i supposed to do 
she bet me 50 bucks
she had a better body than you 
and i had to defend your honor 
oh  what a bunch of bullshit 
i have a much better body
than she does 
she s right 
you haven t changed at all  have you 
i m afraid i have  or i wouldn t be here 
come on  lynn  don t make me do time
for things that happened years ago 
jake  i m sorry 
you ll just always be the little boy
who wouldn t grow up 
lynn 
a quarter of the season s gone 
we re 15 and 24 
seven games out of first 
that s bad  it s not bad enough 
plus  this team is showing
signs of improvement 
i didn t think we d win
15 games all year 
  any ideas 
  on how we can get worse 
how about a series of fines
for good play 
maybe a  30 000 bonus for the guy
voted least valuable player 
maybe the problem is
we re coddling these guys too much 
yeah 
what s with this 
we never leave from down here 
maybe the jetway isn t working 
hey  this is good  this is real good 
a 757 to milwaukee 
no  that s not your plane 
yours is this one rolling in 
oh  sure  now you come around 
he s not fooled 
so  the sons of geronimo 
still suffering from propeller lag 
are nipped by the brewers tonight 
seven to nothing 
the only excitement for the tribe
provided by rick vaughn 
who set an american league record
by throwing four wild pitches
in one inning 
hey  congratulations  rick 
excuse me  mr  vaughn

  suck my dick 
  pepper says you wanted to see me 
  yeah  rick 
come on in  have a seat 
rick  i m not gonna
beat around the bush here 
you ve got a great arm 
it s one of the best i ve ever seen 
but your control hasn t come around
like we d hoped it would 
now  a lot of pitchers started off wild 
and after they worked it out
in the minors for a while 
they went on to great careers 
take ryan there 
  what about him 
  never mind ryan 
read these letters for me 
you can t read them  can you 
yo  man  they look nice 
i had a pair just like  em 
well  after the game  i m gonna
pick out a pair that s more me 
  good luck 
  they look good 
besides  seeing s
the most important thing  son 
i don t think it s that important 
fuck 
all right  let s hit the field 
up your butt  jobu 
yo  bartender  jobu needs a refill 
  head s up 
  yo  watch it 
hustle  let s go 
  god damn 
  shit 
we re in the ninth 
two down  a man on first 
and the indians clinging to
a one run lead 
ricky vaughn 
the kid they call  wild thing  
one out away
from his first major league victory 
vaughn s been looking good
out there today 
don t worry  he ll blow it 
vaughn s showing some signs
of fatigue out there 
he seems to have lost some zip
on his fastball 
slow curve  here s a swing 
and a bouncing ball 
dorn has a chance to make the play 
he can t get it 
clark digging around second 
he ll make it to third easily 
and the a s have runners at the corners 
dorn didn t get much of a jump
on that ball  monte 
but let s give him credit 
at least he didn t spike himself 
you want me to get him
out of there  lou 
no 
he s come this far 
let s see if he can finish it 
come on  we need some defense here 
johnny  maybe we ought to do
one of those waves 
so  vaughn in a little trouble here 
but i ll tell you 
these cleveland fans are great 
listen to them get behind vaughn 
  hey  way to go  rick 
  go  rick 
come on  baby  come on  ricky 
come on  ricky 
okay  ricky  there s two outs 
so forget about the runners 
get this guy at the plate 
come on  rick  get tough 
this guy s a first ball hitter 
you gotta come up
with something nasty 
fucking dorn 
this game should be over by now 
he could have had that ball 
he tanked it on purpose 
this isn t the california penal league 
vaughn 
we re professionals here 
we don t tank plays
for personal reasons 
so cut the crybaby shit 
now  you pitched a hell of a game 
you want to finish it  don t you 
  yeah 
  all right 
you think you can throw
a strike on this pitch 
there s not gonna be much on it 
my arm feels like jell o right now 
just get it over the plate 
i want him to swing 
last time i did that 
the guy hit one that hasn t landed yet 
don t worry about it  i ll take care of it 
number 27  right fielder mike rexman 
hi  rexman 
hell of a situation we got here 
two on  two out 
you guys trailing by one in the ninth 
you got a chance to be a hero
on national television 
if you don t blow it 
by the way  i saw your wife
at the capri lounge last night 
hell of a dancer 
you must be very  very proud 
that guy she was with 
i mean  i m sure
he s a close personal friend and all 
but tell me  what was he doing
wearing her panties on his head 
swung on and popped up 
uh oh  rexie 
i don t think this one s got the distance 
taylor under it 
he s got it  and this ball game is over   
shit 
   as the indians hold out
for a 3 2 victory
