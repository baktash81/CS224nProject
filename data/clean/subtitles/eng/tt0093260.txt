the world over 
we are a nation
with a tradition of heroism   
does anybody know where the head is 
   with us here tonight   
   fill that need 
through their strength of character 
their fortitude   
   they have proven themselves
to be worthy of the appellation   
   hero

   to a breed of men   
where can a guy take a leak around here 
well  damn if we re not balls to the wall   
   with all american hero types
here tonight 
i see space walkers   
   and moon walkers
and earth orbiters galore 
and over here 
we have the current cream of the crop 
america s best and brightest 
that s a good one  boys 
the most excitement i ever had
was the time i landed a crippled f 14   
   with a stubborn nose gear on the deck
of a rolling flattop in zero visibility 
but you boys   
   you get to test out these babies 
i envy you 
gentlemen  i salute you

really  you re right 
when my moment of truth came  i didn t
take a dump down the leg of my flight suit 
you son of a   
come on  it s what you always wanted 
a piece of tuck pendelton 
shouldn t the project be declassified 
you know i can t tell you that 
would you just excuse me  i m sorry 
all right  that s enough  that s enough 
hello  pete  where s your uniform 
where yours should ve been

  what s the big deal 
  things are different now 
it just hurts me too much to be with you 
lydia 
lydia  i stubbed my toe on the cab
when i kicked the door 
i think it s broken 
better your toe than your heart 
can we go now  please 
lydia 
i hope you didn t leave your purse
back there 
okay  jack  let s review 
we ve got nausea  shortness of breath   
   dizziness and headaches 
big  pounding headaches 
what s going on up here 
where did you get that rash 
  hairspray 
  hairspray 
it also makes me sneeze like crazy 
  what do you think 
  i think you re allergic to hairspray 
isn t this great  jack 
we re making real progress here today 
the nightmares still keeping you awake
at night 
now i have a new one 
put your head back  tell me about it 
i m at the market 
working one of the registers 
i suddenly notice that the next customer
is this horrible   
   obnoxious woman
with bright orange hair 
i m passing her stuff over   
   the bar code scanner  i don t notice it   
   but the computer is ringing up
the wrong prices 
so when i m all done 
i look at the total and it s way up over   
   and it s way up over  100 000 
so the woman with the orange hair
says to me  real calm   
   she says to me 
 i don t carry that kind of cash
around on me  sweetie  
open wide 
i say   oh  is that right  
and she says   will you take this instead  
she reaches into her purse   
   and pulls out a little pearl handled pistol 
she pulls back on the trigger
and at that moment i wake up screaming 
take it easy  jack  it s all right 
the nurse will get it 
just sit down 
i m sorry  jack 
i didn t mean to push you off 
jack  please  sit down and relax 
catch your breath 
you know that i am more than your doctor 
i m your friend 
you re one of my favorite patients 
let s face it 
your regular office visits
are the cornerstone of my entire practice 
the problem is 
medicine is not what you need  jack 
what you need is rest and relaxation 
a total change of scene 
maybe a nice vacation 
how does that sound 
it sounds rood 
then take one 
and find a place that s peaceful and quiet 
the most important thing for you now
is no excitement 
got it 
  i know it s hard to believe   
  hard  try  impossible  
that s why i want you to see for yourself 
then  if you re interested 
the project is yours 
first amaze me  then we ll talk funding 
damn this traffic  we re gonna be late 
just out of curiosity  who s your guy 
your pilot 
you might know him  tuck pendelton 
  why did you choose him 
  he had the right qualifications 
  such as 
  he was the only one crazy enough to do it 
let me tell you about tuck pendelton 
he could have been one of the best 
but he hates authority   
   he can t take orders 
and he likes to make up his own rules 
don t look so depressed 
the experiment is bound to fail
long before pendelton can screw it up 
how does that feel  it feels rood 
then do it again 
the tuck pendelton machine  zero defects 
  you re not retting nervous  are you 
  not yet 
let s review the neuromuscular
facial response experiment one more time 
let s not  all right 
  what do you mean   let s not  
  who s nervous now 
i know what our objectives are 
i ve done my homework 
i can do this little job blindfolded
and backwards  so everyone calm down 
alpha level technicians 
report to monitoring stations 
optical sensor check commencing 
initiate hyper conic speaker check 
initiating 
  good luck  lieutenant 
  thank you 
zero minus five 
all personnel to their stations  please 
just one more thing  lieutenant 
i want to make sure
we ve got everything down 
it s not going to be simple 
but there shouldn t be any surprises or   
good luck  lieutenant 
be careful of this unit 
i spilled coffee on it last week 
it s not quite as reliable as it was 
still rolling  great 
we are using an experimental   
   submersible pod 
modified with a performance enhanced   
   helium neon laser scalpel
of our own design 
this was a 50 milliwatt unit   
   which we increased to 600 milliwatts   
just pay attention to your business there 
600 milliwatts   
   which  in terms of spacial equivalency 
would be a 60 kilowatt unit 
this is done because we have
such high efficiency  possible   
   because of our enhanced spectral coding 
all surfaces within the laser assembly   
this is done in a chamber 
which is constructed from a generator   
   coupled with
a common home carpet sweeper 
would you bring up the biomed
on the specimen  please 
oxygen percentage  check 
air tanks fully charged 
doppler phase translocator activated 
state of the art 
all personnel 
we are now at priority level one 
secure all stations 
environmental control systems  check 
gyro stabilization xyz coordinates  check 
laser subsystem analysis  check 
pod lockdown and rotation complete 
begin phase two of alignment 
prepare for shield closure 
  lieutenant  do you read me 
  rock and roll 
stand by 
i need final confirmation from biomed 
biomed complete 
  and from optoelectrical station three 
  three  check 
  station two 
  two  check 
  and the mrd 
  entry point plotted 
cc  do you confirm we re clear to proceed 
dr  niles isn t here yet 
that s his trouble  not mine 
nothing i can do 
prepare pem number one 
activate photon echo memory system 
insert pem number one 
commencing pem number one s insertion 
open pre feed to the hydroperc chamber 
pull up a display
on the photon densitometer 
stand by  lieutenant

these should have been on my desk
a week ago 
do you have any other papers
you haven t turned in 
pod activated

jack  you re late 
you know it s coupon day 
  you won t believe what happened to me 
  i don t want to hear about it  later 
just punch in and get to work
at register five 
smell this  go on  smell it

let me handle this 
jack 
what the hell is that  ozzie 
ozzie  i can t hear you 
i hope you can hear me 
i ll proceed with the mission as planned 
going to auto pilot 
phase one 
optic nerve interface 
come on  baby  show me the way 
 please wait  
 environmental adjust required  
doesn t anything work 
pathway to optic nerve is as follows 
superior gluteal vein to iliac vein   
   to inferior vena cava
passed right atrium   
   to superior vena cava
to right jugular vein to optic chiasma 
let s drive 
entering bloodstream 
you ve always been like a son to me 
well  a nephew  anyway 
you ve got a great future ahead of you
in retail food marketing 
i d hate to see you throw it all away
by going psycho on us 
  coffee  thank you 
  i got it down the hall 
smoking 
deploying optic remote 
optic sensor armed and ready 
switch to manual projectory control 
firing optic sensor 
what s wrong  jack  let me see 
let me see 
come on  where the hell is the picture 
all right  oz 
that s not oz  who the hell is that 
where s the lab technician 
where s the lab 
it was just so strange  it was like   
   someone suddenly shoved
a white hot needle through my eye 
oh  god 
you stand up now  jack 
what is this 
did burs just stand up 
what s going on  this can t be

go right ahead  jack  what a rood idea 
ozzie  what have you done 
i can t be inside a man  i studied rabbits 
i gotta talk to this guy 
pathway to middle ear is as follows   
miniaturization is achieved   
   by pairing two 500 series
photon echo memory chips   
   or pems as we call them 
a controller and a remote 
only the controller
is needed for miniaturization   
   but a combination of the two chips
must be used to re enlarge 
 j  putter  assistant manager  
find him 
approaching middle ear 
hello  can you hear me 
repeat  repeat 
respond if you can hear me 
  who  me 
  it works  i can hear you 
would you talk to me  please 
who are you  what s your name

some sort of theistic hysteria 
how do you treat that 
well  the medieval remedy   
   was to flay the skin off your body

and we got to help each other out 
you don t work at the lab  do you 
lab  no  i work at safeway 
and you don t know anything
about the experiment 
what experiment 
oh  god 
  the miniaturization experiment 
  no 
my name is lieutenant tuck pendelton 
i ve been miniaturized 
i was supposed to be injected
into the body of a lab rabbit   
   and somehow i got inside you instead 
what do you mean  somehow   how 
all i know is i was inside a syringe
and now i m inside you 
  are you jack potter 
  putter 
  this yours

i made the drop 
how do you know 
gut reaction  get out  get out right now 
piece of cake

put your knee up 
kick him where it counts 
now hit him  run 
tuck  what s going on 
jack  you did real rood 
try and calm down 
i ve got a little problem here 
i m going off radio contact for a minute 
shit 
approaching tricuspid valve of heart 
do not enter 
  do not enter heart 
  back  baby  back 
turbo thrusters at maximum 
warning 
cardiovascular threshold exceeded 
cardiac arrest imminent 
take evasive action 
just a little further 
this won t hurt a bit 
up  up  up  that s it  let s go 
you ve got one hell of a pump  jack 
  where have you been 
  never mind  let s just get to the lab 
you mean to tell me
he can actually talk to you 
yes  and i can talk to him 
also  he s able to see everything that i see 
he s patched into the optic nerve and
eardrum  it was part of the experiment   
   to see if we could make audio
and visual contact with the host organism 
  come on  doc  this is a guy  not a bunny 
  the computer doesn t know that 
it simply reads the environment
and makes the proper adjustments 
  can you see me  lieutenant pendelton 
  yeah  i can see you 
yes  he can 
good work  job well done 
good work  i can t believe this 
find out what went wrong 
the lieutenant is wondering
what went wrong 
i ll tell you 
you threw in with a bunch of eggheads   
   who know squat about security 
  thanks for the hot tip 
  but don t worry  buddy 
we ll do all we can
to get you out of this civilian 
you better  you two faced son of a bitch 
  tuck says   thank you  
  yeah 
excuse us a minute 
let me talk to you outside 
stay here  both of you 
that s rood 
you re home free now 
i never trusted pete blanchard 
can you see where they went 
yes  hold on  yes 
look directly at them  i think
i can beef up the reception a bit 
i m trying to explain to you
exactly what s going on 
we re not the only ones
working on miniaturization 
don t you think i know that  niles 
  i can hear them 
  i know  shut up and listen 
sorry 
we are the first to perfect
the tricky re enlargement process   
   by using two chips 
one of the chips is in the pod 
the other one has been stolen 
now how do we save pendelton 
  find the stolen chip 
  don t you have duplicates 
no  they re prototypes 
that s thinking ahead  niles 
we can make duplicates 
  but not by 9 00 a m  tomorrow 
  what happens at 9 00 
by 9 00 his air supply runs out 
that is no problem 
he can go to the guy s lungs  open
the hatch and breathe the air he needs 
he can t open the hatch 
the sudden change in the cabin pressure
would make the pod explode like a balloon 
that s right  einstein 
  then we don t have to do anything 
  what do you mean 
the stolen chip is useless
without the one in the pod  which we have 
build your duplicates 
it doesn t matter how long it takes 
we ll be back in business 
  what about pendelton 
  we can t save him  that s too bad 
thanks  pete 
maybe we can use him
to bring the thieves out into the open 
  find it 
  yeah 
put it on  keys are in the pocket 
car s out back  see that door 
use it 
what are you waiting on 
don t rush me 
be quiet and let me think this through 
i want you to factor this into your thinking 
you heard the guy 
my air supply is running out 
if you don t help me 
you ll end up with this miniaturized pod   
   floating around your insides with this
teeny human skeleton at the helm 
not a pretty thought 
all right 
  but you have to do something for me 
  anything  let s just go 
the red mustang convertible 
you see it  it s over there 
careful  this isn t a honda 
there s 500 horses underneath this baby 
use the clutch  it s a five speed stick 
oh  that s great  doc 
  no pain 
  what 
that s what i want from you  no pain 
don t do anything weird in there  okay 
don t cause an embolism
or an aneurysm or     
   sever my spinal cord and just go 
 oh  sorry   
do you know what i mean 
  okay  no pain 
  thank you 
home sweet home 
  is this where you live 
  yeah  ain t it great  i call it user friendly 
what s this thing 
something else from vector scope
that doesn t work  never mind that 
i need a drink  how about you 
no  i don t drink 
you do now  because i can t have a drink
unless you have a drink 
get the picture 
see the table

something gets stolen maybe 
i don t know  the lab s locked up tight 
why

tuck s in trouble  he needs your help 
tuck is being held for ransom 
in a manner of speaking  yes

to get him back 
unfortunately it was taken

so there was a break in  how did tuck   
  how did you get involved in this 
  me 
  it s a long story 
  good  reporters love long stories 
don t let her take control

and that s why
we ve got to get that little pod   
   out from inside of you 
this guy is definitely not operating
on all eight cylinders 
jack  sitting here  freezing as we are   
   i m reminded of the year i spent
working in the alaskan goldfields

but twice as big 
hold up  wait  go back to the doors 
those were memorable times

this is your moment 
it all comes down to this 
you re not the same man
you were this morning 
you re better  stronger 
you re a man in control of your destiny 
psych yourself up 
see yourself opening the doors  jack   
   and jumping from the truck 
you aren t barring groceries all your life 
see yourself being a hero 
psych yourself up

the cowboy 
i ve tracked his movements for months 
he got to the airport about an hour ago 
and he always stays here 
i think he ll lead us to that chip 
hey  knock it off 
why do you think that 
he s a fence 
he deals in stolen western technology
almost exclusively   
   which he then sells overseas
to the highest bidder 
who do you think introduced velcro
to the persian gulf 
really 
there he is  perfect timing 
we re checking in 
i ll get the suitcase out of the trunk 
it s less suspicious with a suitcase 
how did you know this was here 
tuck keeps a packed suitcase
in the trunk   
   in case he wakes up in a strange place 
oh  no  she knows about the suitcase 
margaret   
   the cowboy is in town
and we don t have that other chip 
i m awfully busy right now  victor 
i ll have to call you back 
just get me that chip 
 i m an old cowhand
 from the rio grande
 but my leg s not bowed
 and my face not tan
 i m a cowboy who s never seen that cow
 can t rope a steer
 cause i don t know how
 and i m not going to start learning how 
i tipped the desk clerk  100 for this room
so we could hear his every move 
when he leaves  we go too 
what if he stays in 
he won t  he loves a club called inferno 
the man does not sleep 
the guy in the truck
said his name was scrimshaw 
what are you looking at 
i thought you were a gentleman 
come on  tuck  what do you expect 
she has the cutest little overbite 
don t you think 
it gives her mouth this adorable 
pouty expression  so sweet 
i know what she looks like 
what is the deal
between you two  anyway 
it s none of your business 
tuck  i need a change of clothes 
mind if i dip into your suitcase 
dip all you like  nothing s going to fit you 
legal counsel

you just remind me of a time   
   when tuck wore this jacket 
it was the night we first met 
you were doing that article about me   
   we had dinner and talked until 3 00 a m 
i got drunk and threw up  and fell
down a manhole walking you home 
it looks like you re pretty hung up
on the guy 
how well do you know tuck 
well  we re very close  actually 
does he   
   talk about me 
i find that tuck tends to be
a little tight lipped about women 
will you knock it off 
if i were tuck 
i d talk about you all the time 
yeah  right 
the cowboy is leaving 
i think i need a ticket 
jack

two things you want to know about me 
one  i make love with my boots on 
and two   
i know i ve been mean to you  jack

it doesn t really matter 
it s probably on account of my life sucking
