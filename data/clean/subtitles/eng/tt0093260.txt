big pounding headaches
whats going on up here
where did you get that rash
hairspray
hairspray
it also makes me sneeze like crazy
what do you think
i think youre allergic to hairspray
isnt this great jack
were making real progress here today
the nightmares still keeping you awake
at night
now i have a new one
put your head back tell me about it
im at the market
working one of the registers
i suddenly notice that the next customer
is this horrible
obnoxious woman
with bright orange hair
im passing her stuff over
the bar code scanner i dont notice it
but the computer is ringing up
the wrong prices
so when im all done
i look at the total and its way up over
and its way up over 100000
so the woman with the orange hair
says to me real calm
she says to me
i dont carry that kind of cash
around on me sweetie
open wide
i say oh is that right
and she says will you take this instead
she reaches into her purse
and pulls out a little pearlhandled pistol
she pulls back on the trigger
and at that moment i wake up screaming
take it easy jack its all right
the nurse will get it
just sit down
im sorry jack
i didnt mean to push you off
jack please sit down and relax
catch your breath
you know that i am more than your doctor
im your friend
youre one of my favorite patients
lets face it
your regular office visits
are the cornerstone of my entire practice
the problem is
medicine is not what you need jack
what you need is rest and relaxation
a total change of scene
maybe a nice vacation
how does that sound
it sounds rood
then take one
and find a place thats peaceful and quiet
the most important thing for you now
is no excitement
got it
i know its hard to believe
hard try impossible
thats why i want you to see for yourself
then if youre interested
the project is yours
first amaze me then well talk funding
damn this traffic were gonna be late
just out of curiosity whos your guy
your pilot
you might know him tuck pendelton
why did you choose him
he had the right qualifications
such as
he was the only one crazy enough to do it
let me tell you about tuck pendelton
he could have been one of the best
but he hates authority
he cant take orders
and he likes to make up his own rules
dont look so depressed
the experiment is bound to fail
long before pendelton can screw it up
how does that feel it feels rood
then do it again
the tuck pendelton machine zero defects
youre not retting nervous are you
not yet
lets review the neuromuscular
facial response experiment one more time
lets not all right
what do you mean lets not
whos nervous now
i know what our objectives are
ive done my homework
i can do this little job blindfolded
and backwards so everyone calm down
alphalevel technicians
report to monitoring stations
optical sensor check commencing
initiate hyperconic speaker check

good luck lieutenant
thank you
zero minus five
all personnel to their stations please
just one more thing lieutenant
i want to make sure
weve got everything down
its not going to be simple
but there shouldnt be any surprises or
good luck lieutenant
be careful of this unit
i spilled coffee on it last week
its not quite as reliable as it was
still rolling great
we are using an experimental
submersible pod
modified with a performanceenhanced
heliumneon laser scalpel
of our own design
this was a 50milliwatt unit
which we increased to 600 milliwatts
just pay attention to your business there
600 milliwatts
which in terms of spacial equivalency
would be a 60kilowatt unit
this is done because we have
such high efficiency possible
because of our enhanced spectral coding
all surfaces within the laser assembly
this is done in a chamber
which is constructed from a generator
coupled with
a common home carpet sweeper
would you bring up the biomed
on the specimen please
oxygen percentage check
air tanks fully charged
doppler phase translocator activated
state of the art
all personnel
we are now at priority level one
secure all stations
environmental control systems check
gyro stabilization xyz coordinates check
laser subsystem analysis check
pod lockdown and rotation complete
begin phase two of alignment
prepare for shield closure
lieutenant do you read me
rock and roll
stand by
i need final confirmation from biomed
biomed complete
and from optoelectrical station three
three check
station two
two check
and the mrd
entry point plotted
cc do you confirm were clear to proceed
dr niles isnt here yet
thats his trouble not mine
nothing i can do
prepare pem number one
activate photon echo memory system
insert pem number one
commencing pem number ones insertion
open prefeed to the hydroperc chamber
pull up a display
on the photon densitometer
stand by lieutenant
insert pem number two
these should have been on my desk
a week ago
do you have any other papers
you havent turned in

ozzie what have you done

i gotta talk to this guy
pathway to middle ear is as follows
miniaturization is achieved
by pairing two 500 series
photon echo memory chips
or pems as we call them
a controller and a remote
only the controller
is needed for miniaturization
but a combination of the two chips
must be used to reenlarge
j putter assistant manager
find him
approaching middle ear
hello can you hear me

yes
were in this together
and we got to help each other out
you dont work at the lab do you
lab no i work at safeway
and you dont know anything
about the experiment
what experiment
oh god
the miniaturization experiment
no
my name is lieutenant tuck pendelton
ive been miniaturized
i was supposed to be injected
into the body of a lab rabbit
and somehow i got inside you instead
what do you mean somehow how
all i know is i was inside a syringe
and now im inside you
are you jack potter
putter

shit
approaching tricuspid valve of heart
do not enter
do not enter heart
back baby back
turbo thrusters at maximum
warning
cardiovascular threshold exceeded
cardiac arrest imminent
take evasive action
just a little further
this wont hurt a bit
up up up thats it lets go
youve got one hell of a pump jack
where have you been
never mind lets just get to the lab
you mean to tell me
he can actually talk to you
yes and i can talk to him
also hes able to see everything that i see
hes patched into the optic nerve and
eardrum it was part of the experiment
to see if we could make audio
and visual contact with the host organism
come on doc this is a guy not a bunny
the computer doesnt know that
it simply reads the environment
and makes the proper adjustments
can you see me lieutenant pendelton
yeah i can see you
yes he can
good work job well done
good work i cant believe this
find out what went wrong
the lieutenant is wondering
what went wrong
ill tell you
you threw in with a bunch of eggheads
who know squat about security
thanks for the hot tip
but dont worry buddy
well do all we can
to get you out of this civilian
you better you twofaced son of a bitch

yeah
excuse us a minute
let me talk to you outside
stay here both of you
thats rood
youre home free now
i never trusted pete blanchard
can you see where they went
yes hold on yes
look directly at them i think
i can beef up the reception a bit
im trying to explain to you
exactly whats going on
were not the only ones
working on miniaturization
dont you think i know that niles
i can hear them
i know shut up and listen
sorry
we are the first to perfect
the tricky reenlargement process
by using two chips
one of the chips is in the pod
the other one has been stolen
now how do we save pendelton
find the stolen chip
dont you have duplicates
no theyre prototypes
thats thinking ahead niles
we can make duplicates
but not by 900 am tomorrow
what happens at 900
by 900 his air supply runs out
that is no problem
he can go to the guys lungs open
the hatch and breathe the air he needs
he cant open the hatch
the sudden change in the cabin pressure
would make the pod explode like a balloon
thats right einstein
then we dont have to do anything
what do you mean
the stolen chip is useless
without the one in the pod which we have
build your duplicates
it doesnt matter how long it takes
well be back in business
what about pendelton
we cant save him thats too bad
thanks pete
maybe we can use him
to bring the thieves out into the open
find it
yeah
put it on keys are in the pocket
cars out back see that door
use it
what are you waiting on
dont rush me
be quiet and let me think this through
i want you to factor this into your thinking
you heard the guy
my air supply is running out
if you dont help me
youll end up with this miniaturized pod
floating around your insides with this
teeny human skeleton at the helm
not a pretty thought
all right
but you have to do something for me
anything lets just go
the red mustang convertible
you see it its over there
careful this isnt a honda
theres 500 horses underneath this baby
use the clutch its a fivespeed stick

harry people are retting murdered
a scientist named ozzie wexler

lydia shut up and listen
lydia shut up and listen
you said that good
tucks in trouble he needs your help

in a manner of speaking yes
we need a certain microchip
to get him back
unfortunately it was taken
from vectorscope labs this morning
so there was a breakin how did tuck
how did you get involved in this
me
its a long story
good reporters love long stories
dont let her take control
