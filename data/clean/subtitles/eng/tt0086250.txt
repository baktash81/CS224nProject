i can guarantee production   
of 200 kiios refined
every month of the year 
the probiem is 
i have no steady market 
basicaiiy  what i m iooking for
is somebody in the states   
who can share the risk with me 
somebody who can guarantee   
to buy from me  say 
150 kiios a month 
that s a big commitment  mr  sosa 
something iike that    
too bad frank s not here 
you shouid taik to him 
 it wouid ve been nice if he d come 
 he wouid iike to come

of moving it 
we ii be cutting out the coiombians 
know what that means 
that means we have
to go to war with them 
we cut out the coiombians 
we take risks on both sides 
tony  why don t we spiit the risk 
you guarantee your deiivery 
say  as far as panama

so what s your probiem  aiex 
i ii show you my probiem 
interviewer  i ve heard about financial   
support the government receives   
from the drug industry in bolivia 
well  the irony of this
is that this money   
which is in the billions   
is coming from your country 
you are the major purchaser
of our national product   
which is cocaine 
interviewer  you re saying
the u s  government   
is spending millions to eliminate
the flow of drugs onto our streets 
at the same time   
we are doing business
with the same government   
that is flooding our streets
with cocaine 
let me show you
a few of the other characters   
that are involved
in this tragic comedy 
my organisation just recently traced
a large purchase by this man 
this charming face here
belongs to general cucombre 
he is the minister of the defence
of bolivia  my country 
and general cucombre just
a couple months ago   
bought a  12 million villa
on lake lucerne in switzerland 
now  if cucombre is supposed to be
the bolivian defence minister   
what is he doing
living in switzerland 
guarding cash registers 
this man here  alejandro sosa 
a very interesting character 
he s a wealthy landowner   
educated in england 
very good family 
but this man is the business brain
and drug overlord   
of an empire that stretches
across the andes 
he s not your ordinary drug dealer 
interviewer  well  discussing it openly    
he s scheduied for 60 minutes next 
he is going on french  british 
itaiian  japanese teievision 
peopie everywhere
are starting to iisten to him 
it s embarrassing  tony

you remember aiberto  don t you
