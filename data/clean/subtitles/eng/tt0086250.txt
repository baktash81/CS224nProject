of 200 kiios refined
every month of the year
the probiem is
i have no steady market
basicaiiy what im iooking for
is somebody in the states
who can share the risk with me
somebody who can guarantee
to buy from me say
150 kiios a month
thats a big commitment mr sosa
something iike that
too bad franks not here
you shouid taik to him
it wouidve been nice if hed come
he wouid iike to come

you got good stuff here
ciassa shit
this lopez guarantees
to buy 150 kiios from me
every month of the year
he picks it up here
i can seii it to him
for as iittie as
7000 a key
you cant do better than that
but then we got to take the risk
of moving it
weii be cutting out the coiombians

that means we have
to go to war with them
we cut out the coiombians
we take risks on both sides
tony why dont we spiit the risk

interviewer ive heard about financial
support the government receives
from the drug industry in bolivia
well the irony of this
is that this money
which is in the billions
is coming from your country
you are the major purchaser
of our national product
which is cocaine
interviewer youre saying
the us government
is spending millions to eliminate
the flow of drugs onto our streets
at the same time
we are doing business
with the same government
that is flooding our streets
with cocaine
let me show you
a few of the other characters
that are involved
in this tragic comedy
my organisation just recently traced
a large purchase by this man
this charming face here
belongs to general cucombre
he is the minister of the defence
of bolivia my country
and general cucombre just
a couple months ago
bought a 12 million villa
on lake lucerne in switzerland
now if cucombre is supposed to be
the bolivian defence minister
what is he doing
living in switzerland
guarding cash registers
this man here alejandro sosa
a very interesting character
hes a wealthy landowner
educated in england
very good family
but this man is the business brain
and drug overlord
of an empire that stretches
across the andes
hes not your ordinary drug dealer
