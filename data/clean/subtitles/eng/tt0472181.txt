a place inhabited by little blue beings
three apples high 
it lies deep in an enchanted forest 
hidden away beyond a medieval village 
most people believe this place is made up 
only to be found in books
or in children s imaginations 
well  we beg to differ 
yeah  come on  farmer 
i m going in 
all right  greedy  i m gonna race you 
yes 
whoa  golly  farm boys love to fly 
oh  yeah  so excited 
now you see us  now you don t

in smurf village  each and every smurf
plays their own special pad 
  whoa  nellie 
  sorry  handy

smurf on the loose 
  hey  clumsy 
  hey  guys

but  wait  i   
hey  grouchy  hey  gutsy 
whoa  whoa  whoa  slow your roll  sailor 
hey  wait  wait  isn t that the rehearsal
for the blue moon festival 
what can i say  clumsy 
you re not on the list 
grouchy  it s right there 
right  under  do not let in clumsy  
clearly you two
lack the verbal skills required
  to explain this predicament succinctly 
  hey 
  here we go 
  you see  clumsy 
the other smurfs don t want to dance
with you for fear of what are politely called
 fractures  
how could anybody think that 
that s gonna leave a big blue bruise 
wonderful  beautiful  marvelous 
watch it  there 
cut  cut  cut  it s a dance  not dominoes 
  a worry line 
  all right  don t get your petals in a twist 
as happy and as perfect
as life in smurf village is 
even sunshine and butterflies
must have their dark clouds 
and for all smurfs 
that dark cloud has one name 
gargamel  the evil wizard 
la la la la la la
sing a happy song
la la la la la la
this is so wrong
 i m papa smurf 
 i m the head of a small group of blue people
 and live in the forest
with 99 sons and one daughter 
 nothing weird about that  no  no 
totally normal  
 oh  and i m smurfette 
and i think i m so pretty 
 and i betrayed gargamel 
and i don t even care 
 and everything is just
sunshine and rainbows  
but all of that is about to change 
i said   all of that is about to change  
azrael  that s your cue 
that s your cue to
pounce on the miserable beasts
in some kind of a rage induced feline frenzy 
yes  good  yeah  more rage 
hey  but don t go crazy 
these are the only puppets i have 
i am not obsessed with smurfs  thank you 
i simply can t stop thinking about
the miserable beasts
every single minute of every single day 
 cause i need them 
it is only by capturing the little wretches
and extracting their happy blue essence
that my magic will finally become   
not infallible 
invincible  yes  thank you 
i shall become the most powerful wizard
in all of the world 
yeah  but you re milking it  don t milk it 
 o great one  
yes  lying  deceptive 
horrible little smurfette 
 after all your years of smurf less searching 
how ever do you expect to find us  
i m very glad you asked  my dear 
for  you see  i have a magical map
that shows me exactly where
the smurf root grows 
i shall now use my formidable powers
to magically transport us here 
come  my little fish breathed friend 
alakazoop 
great 
ye gods  azrael  you re a boy 
we really need that smurf essence 
alakazamp 
now tie it off right there 
that blue moon time of year again 
time to smurf some magic 
summon a vision
and see what our future holds 
i must get the visioning potion just right 
the magic is always strongest
during the blue moon 
so far  so good 
lots of smiles and smurf berries 
clumsy s sitting still  that s always good 
a dragon wand 
i got it  i got it 
clumsy 
  help  save us

  yes  they found   
baby kicked 
  hi 
  hi 
please say hello 
  please 
  hello  little sea monkey 
this is the sound of my voice 
hello  son or daughter  hello 
hello 
that is not the sound of your voice 
that is the voice of a robot 
our child is gonna be attached to the toaster 
or the new vp of marketing 
no  no  oh  my goodness  oh  my gosh 
  it s   
  it s provisional 
if i wow cruella de odile 
then i ll keep the job 
if not  then my head ll be on a pike
next to the last guy 
well  wow you will  you wowed me 
but i have two days 
  yikes 
  i know 
what if i don t get them done in time 
oh  ho  you can t come to the ultrasound 
unless   
wait  the backup ads we have
did fine in focus groups 
i could retool those 
i d have to work around the clock 
azrael  we ve come so far 
yet ever am i haunted by
the same familiar riddle 
how to find the smurfs 
if only i   
i m sorry  is my thinking
interrupting your vile hacking 
if only i had something of theirs 
a drop of spittle  a fingernail 
some hair  even 
then i could make some smurf magic 
very nice  are you done now 
i don t want to look at it 
what  what 
is that    no  no  it can t be 
it is 
the tawny locks of smurfette 
sweet follicular ambrosia 
silky strands of joy 
mixed with a fair amount of cat vomit 
yes  yes  i am a genius 
with my skills  even this small trifle
of smurfiness
will yield me just enough power
to catch them all 
i must find a laboratory with which to tease
the magic from these precious little strands 
yes  it s a bit small 
but this should do nicely 
it s even got its own cauldron 
what died in here 
open  open  open  open  open 
somebody s been working a dark
and terrible magic in there 
what is that 
on  baby 
daddy is home 
come on 
papa  i m familiar with 613 shades of blue 
  and that moon is not one of them 
  papa 
stay calm  everyone 
if the portal opened once  it can open again 
how are we gonna open a magical portal
when we can t even find clumsy 
hey  i think i see something up there

grace  we re being attacked 
do not be fooled by their cuteness 
it s okay  it s okay 
they re friendly 
you re lucky your lassie stepped in 
i was about to make haggis
with your innards 
this is it  this is it  azrael 
smurfette s hair goes in here 
flows through the smurf essence extractor 
and finally  i have my smurfilator 
it s the pièce de résistance  the crème de la   
would you care for a mint when you re done 
yes  yes  yes 
with this precious elixir 
my sorcerous spell shall be powerful
beyond all measurable measurement 
this one tiny drop will give me
the power to capture them all 
this is great 
la la la la la la
smurf the whole day long
next time you re feeling blue
just let a smile begin
happy things will come to you
so smurf yourself a grin
it s so obvious
that what you re doing is wrong 
oh  really  after you 
how crazy is this 
there are little blue people
singing in our kitchen 
so you re sticking with your
 this is actually happening  theory 
sorry 
okay  it says here smurfs are
mythical creatures from belgium 
  also known as schtroumpfs   
  yeah 
documented by peyo 
also says that they bring good luck 
like leprechauns to the irish 
it says they re mythical  grace 
  i m so sorry  master winslow 
  that was great 
well  they look pretty real to me 
come on 
  excuse me 
  okay  to review 
you guys come from a magic forest
where you live in oversized mushrooms 
  yes 
  you re being chased by an evil wizard 
  yeah 
  and you re trapped in new york
  until there s a blue moon   
  very good 
and you like to use the
extremely imprecise term  smurf 
  for just about everything 
  smurfxactly 
and you re all
named after your personalities 
do you get your names when you re born 
or after you ve exhibited certain traits 
  yeah 
  yep 
yeah  whatever 
master winslow  there must be
something about the blue moon
on your magic window machine 
just what is this magic searching device 
right now  i m using google 
  google 
  google 
okay   blue moon 
a full moon that occurs twice in one month 
 a figurative construct    
  much like yourselves 
  hey 
 but the moon itself
doesn t appear to be blue  
  what 
  not blue 
  perfect 
  now we ll never get home 
no cause for alarm  my little smurfs 
if we re to open the portal home 
i ll just have to smurf us a potion
to invoke the blue moon 
you hear that  honey 
they re only staying till
an actual blue moon rises 
which could happen if the little blue
santa man makes a magic potion 
which  at this point 
seems completely plausible 
  want a bite 
  no  thank you 
of course  the stars will
need to be perfectly aligned 
and when that might be is hard to determine
without the proper instrument 
master winslow 
might i borrow your stargazer 
my what whatzer 
he doesn t have a stargazer  do you 
  this is all my fault 
  we re all gonna die 
  we re all gonna die 
  smurf out of it  scaredy brains 
  one panicky smurf is enough 
  hey 
besides  papa had a vision 
and everything turns out smurf y 
right  papa 
yes  yes  it all turns out just fine 
we must find this smurf thief 
stop your complaining 
if i were a smurf  where would i go 
you there  you there  fancy pants 
have you seen any little blue men 
  absolutely  what price are we talking about 
  you re selling them 
  have you looked in the drawer  sweetie 
  wait  what drawer 
  in the kitchen  lilly 
  who is this lilly 
are you kidding 
she s the hottest girl in my department 
please  please  please  young woodsman 
what does the temperature of this lilly
have to do with the finding of smurfs 
  take your meds  man 
  what 
is everyone in this realm completely insane 
thank the gods  a local wizard  excellent 
pardon me  wise sir 
by any chance  have you seen
any little blue men 
they re everywhere 
i knew it  i knew it 
i told you we were close  azrael 
i know 
now  just take one  everybody 
we have to make sure our smurf berries last 
great  we re gonna be here how long 
not long  first  we have to get a stargazer 
next  find a book of spells
and then smurf a portal
and we re home 
very simple  my little smurfs
