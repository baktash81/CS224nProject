           walter    friendly   
    that was a good casserole   
    she cooked                  
        why did we move         
we both agreed it was best      
i mean  it s best for the kids  
            and  uh             
        it s best for you       
i mean  you got more space here 
you can make yourself           
a darkroom                      
it was time to move             
i got a terrific deal           
on this house                   
    and because it s safe       
        and because  uh         
        i can warm my ass       
        by a real fire          
            those are all       
            terrific reasons    
    you  uh  ever make it       
    in front of a log fire      
  not with you                  
  well  it comes with the house 
it s part of the deal           
you go sit                      
in those empty seats            
now  i also do                  
the  notes on newcomers  column 
for the weekly chronicle

    it s mainly for ladies      
so you just go right ahead      
and tell me about yourself      
    well  there s nothing much  
    to tell  really             
uh  what does your husband do   
          he s a lawyer         
          lawyer                
                me  i m a       
sort of hopeful  would be       
semiprofessional photographer   
what do you think you ll        
miss most about new york        
                oh              
                noise           
               siren wailing    
    well  i don t know          
    who the guy was             
but i m assuming it was         
mr  van sant                    
        well  what time was it  
    mid morning                 
    way before noon             
        well  they sure start   
        early in stepford       
        don t they              
    you mean the guy just just  
    walked up behind her        
            and he put his hands
            on her boobs        
        well  how did he do it  
        exactly                 
        was it like this        
walter                          
        or was it like this     
you re getting me all soapy     
        i m just trying to      
        get the facts straight  
            it s my legal mind  
it s your sexy mind             
stepford has really             
done things to you              
well  i d like to christen      
every room in the house before  
i pay off the mortgage          
just finish the dishes first    
                    yeah        
tell me about your day          
    well  i didn t witness any  
    soft core porno like you    
    so it s dull by comparison  
                    but  uh     
i did  uh  meet some of         
the other stepford commuters    
    you want coffee             
                    sanka       
i haven t gone shopping yet     
    regular will be all right   
        they seem like          
        a bright bunch of guys  
     i mean  they have          
     a nice thing going here    
    they were telling me about  
    the men s association       
        apparently              
        it s the thing to join  
        it s quite an honor     
        to be invited to join   
      why is it an honor        
      why is it an honor        
     because practically        
     every important guy in town
     is a member                
    the commuters and townies   
    i mean  everybody           
    tv executives               
        shrinks  the scientists 
        the police chief        
    the fire chief              
     the head of the hospital   
             the guy who runs   
              the phone company 
so did they ask you             
      did they ask me           
      yes  walter               
    am i going crazy            
    you keep repeating          
    the questions               
did they ask you                
            well  in a way  yes 
in a way you could refuse or    
 in a way you had to accept     
    they said i had             
    a good chance of getting in 
    which i felt good about     
i have to admit though that     
there s one rule that  uh       
    i don t much care for       
    but apparently              
it s gonna be changed in        
oh  six months or something     
            what rule is that   
    well  right now             
    it s strictly men only      
            i give up on you    
    well  what s that           
    supposed to mean            
        why don t you ever once 
        just tell me the truth  
    you pretend we decide       
    things together  but it s   
    always you  what you want   
you asked me if i wanted to move
out here  and i found you d     
already been looking at a house 
    you asked me if i liked this
    place  and i found you d    
    already made a down payment 
    now you re asking me about  
    the lousy men s association 
        and it s quite obvious  
        you ve already joined   
                why bother to   
                ask me at all   
                i m gonna put   
                the kids to bed

and i bet even in scarsdale     
it d take 45 minutes

    he s thinking about         
    all the honey he can get    
    out of the trees here       
he told me he liked it          
even better than central park   
because he can take walks       
by himself                      
and he doesn t have to worry    
about getting lost              
he s really a stepford bear     
        he really knows         
        his way around

    they just showed me         
    around the place

            it s a              
            it s a big change   
                 you ve got to  
                 admit that     
a change for the better         
walter

                claude          
        claude axhelm

         why do they call you   
         diz                    
      because i used to work    
      at disneyland             
      no  really

don t you believe me            
                    no          
why not                         
    you don t look like someone 
    who enjoys making           
    other people happy          
it s been on the market         
for about six months            
no kidding                      
      indistinct                
                    your tea

we might talk about it sometime 
                yeah  certainly 
                absolutely      
        let s get you a napkin  
    i hope your wife has        
    gotten over the accident    
            it was your wife    
            wasn t it           
    oh  yeah                    
    yes  it was nothing         
    it looked worse than it was 
    i should go and see her     
     i should ve done it before 
        she d like that         
shall we make a start           
is it all right                 
if joanna sits in               
        definitely              
        i m sure she s got      
        a lot to contribute     
                    oh  uh      
you want me to get you          
a more comfortable chair  hon   
                no  it s okay   
                    my drink    
                    excuse me   
well  we all know what          
we re here for  so who s        
gonna be the first genius       
well  how about the  uh         
c c christmas toys              
for the under                   
 for the poor kids              
for christ s sake  claude       
it s only may                   
yeah  well  uh  i i guess       
it s a little early to          
start thinking about christmas  
i m frankly more interested     
in the overprivileged kids      
like  my son hated camp         
so naturally charmaine          
won t hear of him going back    
what s he gonna do all summer   
besides drive me batty          
    i thought we might try      
    a tag sale here this year   
put a tag on all his toys       
we ll make a fortune            
  men chattering                
  walter                        
that s a good idea              
i mean we   everybody s         
got something around the house  
that they don t need            
             we can sell the    
                    barn dance  
                 barn dance     
a barn dance                    
that went out in the  40s       
        i think a barn dance    
        would be a good idea    
    well  i d like it anyway    
    wait a minute               
    you re talkin  about        
    a square dance  aren t you  
is that what you mean           
a square dance                  
  chattering continues          
  walter                        
hey  hey  wait   anybody        
ever heard of a cake walk       
                 what s a       
                 a cake walk    
yeah  a cake walk               
it s a dance                    
    well  it s a terrific way   
    to raise money              
  man                           
a cake walk is not a dance      
it s a thing where  uh          
all the women bring over cakes  
and then you draw               
this circle on the floor        
and you got numbers             
  ed                            
look  could we just get back    
to the original subject         
i brought up the possibility    
of a tag sale                   
     you think we could go      
     through with that or not   
            tag sale            
i thought we talked about that  
     nobody said whether they   
     were for or against it     
he said something               
about a barn dance              
you wanna do a barn dance or    
    we even suggested           
    the possibility of putting  
    the barn dance              
and the tag sale together       
at the same time                
  walter                        
well  you have a better idea    
about the town                  
more than i do                  
  ed                            
i would go for the sale         
because you can get in          
somebody s garage               
  voices overlapping            
  claude    i have to           
tell you that we ve always      
run the club democratically     
and we ve always                
        claude                  
        you are full of crap    
it s not my fault               
because                         
                     claude     
  arguing continues             
    and i wanna tell you that   
    i m kind of disgusted       
    about the way you guys      
    are handling yourselves     
    at this meeting             
come on  ed                     
we re just trying to get        
some ideas for you              
i think you ought               
to appoint me chairman          
i ll run the whole thing        
if you d run the whole thing    
you re gonna alienate           
everybody in this town          
  ed                            
and if i can t do it            
my wife charmaine will          
    excuse me                   
    let me see if i kind of get 
    the consensus of all this   
you really are more interested  
in one kind of big event rather 
than a lot of little ones       
    is that                     
    is that fair to say         
    is that what you re         
i mean  a tag sale              
and all that nonsense           
is really not appropriate       
you want something big because  
we have a real need here        
for some                        
well  you know  i think         
this has been a very            
successful meeting  don t you   
i think we ve got enough things 
that we can present             
to the meeting                  
    when is the next meeting    
    i m gonna go check          
    on the children             
         excuse me              
                   ed           
                 it s after     
are you still driving           
that big lincoln                
                         yeah   
you should ve traded it in      
years ago                       
if you drive the way you talk   
you re gonna have               
a lot of accidents              
               door closing     
i ll tell you that              
anybody else want a nightcap    
    yeah  get me                
    a decent brandy  will ya    
            instead of this     
            cooking sherry      
        in case you re wondering
        what i ve been doing    
you re not the ike mazzard

you ll have to forgive me       
i used to gawk                  
at all those girls              
in those magazines              
you blighted my adolescence     
 you know that                  
            i thought i blighted
            your adolescence    
i can t get over this

          keep it

        well  it was            
        this problem i had      
    you see                     
    i i couldn t handle it      
    it was out of control       
    i guess that s              
    one of the reasons          
    ted moved us to stepford    
    the drinking was            
    getting so bad and          
    he blamed the city          
    and all its pressures       
i knew i shouldn t              
have touched the stuff          
    but i did  and i m sorry    
    i ruined it all             
      you don t have to         
      apologize  carol          
      not to us                 
    we just felt                
    that it was important       
    that you two understand     
        you being the newest    
        in stepford             
    we didn t want you getting  
    the wrong opinion           
 we                             
who is  we                      
    oh  well  ted  naturally    
    and ike was there and       
    he s so old and smart       
    after i d sobered up some   
    we asked him and            
you mean the men made you       
come and apologize like this    
            oh  no              
    no  i wanted to  really     
    all they did was sort of    
    confirm my feelings         
        well  why don t you     
        come in                 
    oh  no                      
    no  i ve gotta get back     
    i i ve seen charmaine       
    and  uh                     
        well  i                 
        i oughta get back       
        incredible              
        absolutely unbelievable 
if i was forced to apologize    
every time i got smashed        
i d spend my whole life         
wandering around saying         
 i m sorry  i m sorry           
  i m sorry                     
  joanna

and we re not after you         
to change your whole life style

i ve just been so busy          
what with baking and all that   
        this isn t any kind     
        of a lifelong commitment

we just want to see if

    i m interested              
    i m no fanatic              
    but i m really interested   
        actually  we moved here 
        about two months ago    
            and ed joins this   
            men s association   
believe me  i know that         
it s unfair and sexist          
but frankly  anything that      
gets him out of the house nights
is fine with me                 
    if we could get             
    a consciousness raising     
    group going  you d come     
      what                      
      a consciousness raising   
      session                   
        a bitching session      
        you mean                
sure                            
    like a shot  i d come       
    you wouldn t believe what   
    ed tries putting me through 
    he has a rubber suit        
    made for me in england      
        how about that          
        sports fans             
        what is a rubber suit   
i m  uh  an accent freak        
 i m not sure why               
probably on account of          
i don t   i don t know if you   
noticed or not  but i stammer   
            when you were young 
            you mean            
    no  no                      
    i still do                  
it s just i work extra hard     
to control it                   
now  here                       
i want you to write down        
every place you ve ever lived   
from when you were born         
until now                       
and this is just                
standard vocabulary             
see  it s just                  
straight through the alphabet   
 a    aback    abandon          
like like that                  
    and  uh  this here s        
    easy to operate             
    just push the switch        
    and talk into it            
i think i can manage that       
but    what s this for          
      just a lifelong hobby     
      don t touch it            
    see  once i get             
    enough samples              
i aim to feed them all into     
a computer and program it       
what i ll get back is           
an instant geographical rundown 
on a person                     
i really think it ll be         
more important than fingerprints
in police work                  
        that s very interesting 
        claude                  
        but it s too much work  
    we stepford wives           
    are busy  busy  busy        
    you know  like your wife    
    is he going                 
    to take your fingerprints   
            no  sweetie         
            just like your wife 
bobby and i tried to involve her
in one of our projects          
            but she had         
            too much ironing    
         maybe you could        
         convince her           
         kit sundersen too      
        if they could find      
        the time for me         
        i could find it for you 
    isn t this  uh              
    kind of blackmail  joanna   
    it s what made this country 
    great  claude               
        usually we  uh          
        start out bitching      
    but maybe if we re lucky    
    we can get into something   
    more constructive           
            anybody             
            have any questions  
    well  good                  
    then we might as well       
    get started                 
fine   terrific                 
who wants to go first           
talk about anything             
sex  money  our marriages       
anything at all                 
well  how about if i start      
                     right  yes 
                well            
i think there are times         
when walter cares more about    
the law than he does about me   
            and that can hurt   
i don t think that  uh          
i don t think that  uh          
ed ever loved me                
        i mean                  
    he married me               
    because i looked right      
it made a big impression        
on the other tv executives      
for his wife to look            
like i look                     
    god knows                   
    he s given me things        
i m not complaining             
on that score  but  uh          
    he never loved me           
    i didn t bake anything      
    yesterday                   
it took me so long to get       
the upstairs floor to shine     
i didn t have any time          
to bake                         
        well  you don t have    
        to bake  kit            
        there s no law          
hell  ed s lucky if i remember  
to keep him in white bread      
  charmaine laughing            
        easy on spray starch    
    really                      
    it must save me             
    half an hour a day at least 
        you ll never run short  
        of time again           
        i guarantee it          
i ve just been tempted          
so many times                   
to try easy on                  
i m not trying to be            
a leader or anything            
but we re not supposed          
to delve quite so specifically  
into housework                  
easy on s really that good      
is it                           
            is it that good     
    well  if time is your enemy 
    make friends with easy on   
    that s all i can tell you   
it s so good that               
if ever i became famous         
and the easy on people asked me 
would i do a commercial         
not only would i do it          
i d do it for free              
that s how good it is           
            holy cow            
i think i ll  uh                
take fred for a walk

        did he get out again

to take him for a walk

        i m very fond of you    
    well  i m fond of you too   
                    fred        
                      whistles

                         fred   
                  whistles      
        fred                    
        come on back here       
    now  don t give me          
    a hard time                 
              whistles          
            fred                
      whistling                 
        fred                    
          whistles              
                       barking  
      whispering                
    fred  come here             
        sorry about that  lady  
        i really didn t mean    
        to frighten you         
        oh  it s mrs  eberhart  
yes                             
and you did frighten me         
    once again  mrs  eberhart   
    my apologies                
            but this is         
            a pretty quiet town 
    a lot of very nice houses   
    like your own               
    people have valuable things 
    we have to be careful       
            see that old mansion
            over there          
     it s a landmark building   
i didn t know that              
            some railroad tycoon
            built it in 1870    
    before the men s association
    took it over                
    it was a wreck              
now the association s got       
a restoration committee to try  
and fix up what was ruined      
                so we have to be
                very careful    
    we can t let people         
    just walk around at night   
one of the reasons              
i moved from the city           
was so i could                  
walk around at night            
    well  certainly you and fred
    can walk around at night    
        but i d stick           
        a little closer to home 
                 really         
                 mrs  eberhart  
     this isn t the best place  
     for you to wander around   
    i see                       
    thank you                   
    good night                  
                     good night 
    come on  ed

                     you okay   
        all right  here we go   
      whispering

at this beautiful little inn    
in vermont                      
    just ed and me  you know    
    talking things through      
             we parked merrill  
             with some friends  
             the fishers        
        and we had              
        the most terrific time  
        i can t get             
        my mind operating       
          laughs                
  oh   besides                  
  i m just swamped with work    
  work                          
        oh  yes                 
        i fired nettie          
    yeah  it was                
    it was just the being       
    alone with ed that did it   
    all i ever thought about    
    before was just me          
    well  i m here to tell you  
    that s all over now         
ed s always hankered after      
a heated swimming pool          
and now                         
he s going to get it            
       jackhammer hammering     
  jackhammer continues          
i ve been doing                 
a little research  okay         
and a lot of thinking           
    and i know what             
    i m going to say            
    is gonna sound crazy        
    but if you laugh at it      
    i swear to god              
    i m gonna be sick           
    okay                        
    you remember hearing about  
    the texas tranquilizer      
        it was in time          
        i cut it out            
            wait a sec          
            sit down            
            issue dated         
            october 4  1971     
             71  right          
        it s about why there    
        are almost no murders   
        in el paso              
this scientist has this theory  
that there s something that     
comes from the water in el paso 
it comes from deep wells        
and it s got some chemical      
tranquilizer in it              
and  well  read                 
see  dallas is over             
two times as big as el paso     
but that year  there were       
over 242 murders in dallas      
and there were only             
13 in el paso                   
joanna                          
joanna  i think that s          
what s going on in stepford     
i think there s                 
something in the water          
that turns us                   
into hausfraus  drones          
whatever you want to call it    
charmaine s changed             
carol van sant s changed        
and so have all those           
other women s club members      
        well i                  
        i suppose it s possible 
it can t all be coincidence     
  bobby                         
look at all those places        
electronics   computers         
aerospace junk                  
                and labs        
                who knows what  
they must all be dumping        
their chemical garbage          
            into stepford river 
and it could be                 
making its way to us            
listen  the 6 00 news           
scares me every night           
i don t see what s              
so far out about my theory      
        all right  why don t    
        we write the state      
        environmental agency    
    and have them check         
    the water in the reservoir  
ah  government agencies         
i ve worked for them  joanna    
and if they re                  
way above average               
or any good at all              
they ll manage to lose a letter 
if you send it to them          
they teach courses              
in misfiling at those places    
you know what                   
i think we ought to do          
i think                         
we ought to take a sample       
of the water ourselves          
and then get it                 
to a trustworthy chemist        
the trouble is                  
i don t know anybody            
except  you know                
guys at that stinking           
men s association               
    i lost my virginity         
    to a trustworthy chemist    
ha ha                           
no kidding                      
did he do it on blue cross      
        his name                
        was raymond chandler    
oh  gosh                        
            and we had a gag    
            a sort of a stupid  
            private thing going 
            i used to ask him   
            why he didn t talk  
            like he wrote       
    he wasn t a bit hard boiled 
    and he hated any sort       
    of violence                 
        but i kept it going     
        some nights i wouldn t  
        let him touch me        
    until he told me            
    the plot of his next novel  
which was  of course            
the big sleep                   
  chuckles                      
    sometimes                   
    it nearly drove him crazy   
        isn t it funny          
        the things you do       
        when you re in love     
    we were both seniors at nyu 
    and it wasn t just passion  
    it was love                 
why didn t you marry him        
                i don t know    
                  sighs         
maybe we took the joke too far  
 maybe the fun went out of it   
    i thought walter was going  
    to become perry mason       
so it was farewell  my lovely   
did you ever see that           
anyway  i think                 
if i look in the phone book     
and this guy s                  
still in new york               
then he s our man               
    are you out of your mind    
no                              
    i can t just                
    call him up and say   hi

you deflowered me 12 years ago

        the women in stepford   
        love housework          
            and i thought there 
            might be something  
            in the water        
      where did you find her    
      it s not funny

markowe                         
i can tell you categorically    
that there s no such thing      
as a cleaner compeller          
if there was                    
i would  uh  patent it myself   
make a million bucks            
win the nobel prize             
and retire                      
        i guess we re going     
        i ll see you outside    
i m sorry

because i had to get them

for you to see                  
because i think                 
they re an improvement          
and you ve                      
got to think so too             
i m doing                       
all the talking  i know         
but these

and those are someone else s    
            my best friend s    
            little boys

        don t say anything bad  
these are  um                   
really quite good               
    you re not just saying that 
    because you re frightened   
    i might be a crazy lady     
clearly you are a crazy lady    
but clearly again               
these are nice                  
                wait a minute   
you said good

good is better than nice

your mind  are you              
        no                      
        the results are lovely  
    don t get upset again       
    lovely is better than good  
but  um

with you going crazy            
        it wasn t just that     
        it wasn t just anything

go on outside  all right        
        oh  boy                 
        that s really terrific  
this is really                  
terrific for them               
i remember when my mother       
and father used to yell         
at each other                   
i i i just didn t want them     
to have to go through this      
            well  neither do i  
i m sorry   i said              
i m sorry about the car         
but i was panicked and upset    
oh  look                        
that s no big deal              
it s the rest that bothers me   
just try to look at it          
from my point of view  joanna   
    walter  i just want         
    to say one thing to you     
    bobby really has changed    
    believe me                  
    everything in her house     
    looked like a tv commercial 
well  good    good              
she had to clean it             
sooner or later                 
it looked like                  
a goddamn pigsty                
      scoffs                    
i i mean  when are things       
gonna start sparkling           
around here                     
that s what i d like to know    
i mean  just look at the way    
my kids are dressed             
ragamuffins                     
geez  i work 80 hours a week    
i live in a great house         
and my kids look like           
they belong on welfare          
look  if you paid a little      
more attention to your family   
and a little less               
to your goddamn picture taking  
    i m getting out of stepford 
     i m getting us a house now 
     and if it s hard on you    
     tough                      
and if it s hard on the kids    
i ll just ease up on my goddamn 
picture taking                  
     and stay around the house  
     and believe me             
     they ll survive            
        that s what i m         
        talking about  walter   
        is surviving            
okay    all right               
i mean  i ll take a loss on     
this great house if i have to   
but there s one condition       
or we don t go anywhere         
you   you see somebody          
you get some help               
you see a psychiatrist          
    i m fine                    
    i don t need to see anybody 
you say you re fine             
but me  i d                     
i d like another opinion        
because i m not too anxious     
to move to eastbridge           
and after four months there     
be told by my sweet wife        
we ve got to move again         
because she doesn t like        
the way her new neighbors       
keep their houses clean         
                  sighs         
look  i m not asking            
anything unreasonable           
and i don t like asking it      
but   but you want me           
to disrupt our lives            
for the second time             
in a couple of months           
on some fixation you ve got     
that s the unreasonable part    
you ve got to see that          
    look    you and me  we      
    we don t have               
    to fight about this         
    we re gonna move            
    it s   it s only            
    a few more weeks            
                    look        
        it doesn t have to be   
        anything dramatic       
            there s a couple    
            of topnotch guys    
            right here in town  
    just talk to one of them    
    they d see you              
        but i wouldn t see them 
if i see anybody                
i ll find my own                
  joanna                        
i m here at                     
my husband s insistence         
    we moved to stepford        
    with our children           
    oh  a few months ago        
    before that                 
    we were in manhattan        
    and now i want to move out  
    you see  i have nothing     
    against the general area    
    but the women in stepford   
    just seem to be             
    on a different wavelength   
  woman                         
well  that all seems            
very straightforward            
and your husband wants you      
to see me because               
    he feels i m being          
    irrational                  
    he says there s             
    no certainty i d like       
    eastbridge or someplace     
    like that any better        
and he doesn t want             
to spend his life moving        
from one house to another       
        yes   understandable    
        but stepford  i know    
        has a reputation        
        for being unsocial      
so i also understand            
why you might be unhappy there  
        i d be unhappy there    
        any move is traumatic   
    and a city to suburbs move  
    for a woman with interests  
    other than purely family    
            can seem like       
            a jaunt to siberia  
        what would you          
        think of if i said      
        westport  connecticut   
    writers   artists           
    now you have                
    no reason to know this      
    but truro  massachusetts    
        is sort of              
        an elephant s graveyard 
        for psychoanalysts      
perhaps stepford is heaven      
for the house and garden type   
    one person tells another    
      laughs                    
some don t like it and leave    
others that do like it  arrive  
        i mean  westport didn t 
        always have writers     
        they didn t breed       
        from the original pair  
    i understand                
        well  i m not surprised 
        you re obviously        
        a very bright woman     
    what does surprise me       
    is that you have come all   
    this way to talk to me      
             and then you       
             don t talk to me   
            i think the men     
            are behind it       
                     what men   
                all of them     
            all of them         
            in the association  
my husband   everyone           
    the women don t             
    can t arrive in stepford    
    loving housework            
they change                     
once they get there   i think   
the men make them change        
        how would they do that  
i don t know                    
they    they                    
oh  jesus                       
it s so awful                   
if i m wrong                    
i m insane                      
and if i m right                
it s worse than if i m wrong    
i don t know                    
what they do exactly            
they   they draw our pictures   
and they tape our voices        
and the women                   
all look neat and pretty        
there s a man                   
he s   he s a druggist          
he runs the pharmacy            
and he s nothing                
he s nothing                    
but his wife                    
is just breathtaking            
and once  by mistake            
i happened to hear them         
making love                     
and she was                     
carrying on incredibly  like he 
was some kind of god s gift     
and charmaine                   
changed in four months          
and ripped up her tennis court  
and bobby  my best friend       
changed in four months          
and that s what convinced me    
that s how long                 
i ve been in stepford           
four months                     
and i don t know                
what s going on                 
i just know something s wrong   
and my time is coming           
    you re terribly frightened  
    aren t you                  
    can you sleep               
    well  that s easy           
    we can take care of that    
     and we ll see              
     a lot of each other        
     and you can talk some more 
        see  it s unfortunate   
        but i have to go away   
        for a couple of days    
        it s something          
        i can t put off         
        at this short notice    
             but when i m back  
             we ll talk         
        no                      
         no  you don t          
         want to talk or what   
i won t be here                 
when you get back               
don t you see                   
it s going to happen            
before then   don t ask me      
to explain it   i just know     
there ll be somebody            
with my name                    
and she ll cook and clean       
like crazy  but she won t       
take pictures                   
and she won t be me             
        she ll                  
she ll   she ll be like         
one of those robots             
in disneyland                   
        all right  now listen   
    i ll give you a prescription
    which you have filled       
    then you                    
    gather up your children     
    and you get the hell away   
don t tell your husband         
don t tell anyone               
just go wherever you feel safe  
    now  do you have family     
    they re dead                
            well  just drive    
            and stop someplace  
    and in a few days           
    i ll be back on the 10th    
you ring me                     
i ll come to you                
and we ll sort this thing out

        you caused everybody    
                 poor walter s  
                 very concerned 
    where are my children       
the first time i met you        
i knew you were a good mother   
        oh  they re quite safe  
         having a lovely evening
         with charmaine         
            she was thrilled    
            to have them        
    what have you got there     
        oh  no   no  you re     
        not going to need that  
it s nothing like that at all   
you ve got quite the wrong idea 
     you ve had the wrong idea  
     all the time               
             it s nothing       
             like you imagined  
    just  uh  another stage     
    think about it like that    
    and there s nothing to it   
            why                 
                    why         
            because we can      
    we found a way of doing it  
    that s just perfect         
            perfect for us      
            and perfect for you 
    you re a very good subject  
    perhaps the best we ve had  
    you were brighter than most 
            do you mind         
            if i make a call    
  dialing                       
        see  think of it        
        the other way around    
    wouldn t you like some      
    perfect stud waiting on you 
    around the house            
             praising you       
             servicing you      
    whispering how your         
    sagging flesh was beautiful 
    no matter how you looked    
                excuse me       
            everything s fine   
         yeah  just as i said   
        aren t i always right   
    yes  i ll take it from now  
    everybody can go home       
    well  that s all there is   
            so why don t        
            we get it over      
    you know                    
     you hurried us a little    
        we weren t quite ready  
        for you  if you want    
        to know the truth       
  thunder
