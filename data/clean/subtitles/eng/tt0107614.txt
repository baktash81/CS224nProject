pudgie dont smoke

hey listen you know you could always
stay with us just as long as you want
thank you but im ok really
i mean this is
this is just a temporary thing
i know miranda
its gonna blow over
mr and mrs hillard although these custody
proceedings tend to favor the mother
we also realize
perhaps now more than ever
that it is not in a childs best interest
to deprive him or her
of an obviously loving father
however since at the present time
mr hillard has no place to live
and no employment
it is the courts ruling
to award sole custody to mrs hillard
congratulations
no
mr hillard will have
visitation rights every saturday
cant you do something
hes made his decision
isnt it traditional to say
i object or something
your honor please
you mean every saturday
thats one day a week
thats not enough
i have to be with my children
its not a question really i mean
i have to be with them sir please
i know it seems like a lot
but for me its not enough really
i havent been away from em
for more than one day
since the day they were born
mr hillard i would like to add that
this ruling is only temporary
oh good
i will assign a court liaison
to oversee your case
and there will be a continuance
of these proceedings in 90 days
im giving you three months mr hillard
thank you
three months in which to get a job
keep it and create a suitable home
if this proves to be a possibility for you
i will consider a jointcustody
arrangement when we reconvene
were adjourned
well it looks like there is a little light
at the end of our tunnel heh
thats all my stuff
this is all my fault
god no

i should have never had a birthday dad

i was a little liberal with the atomizer
and at my age dear you know
its like a good stilton
everything does have its own aroma
i admire that honesty nattie
thats a noble quality never lose that
it often disappears with age
or entering politics
look at that face
you remind me of stuart little
one of the most honorable creatures
in all of literature

yeah its one of my favorites
oh
mine too
maybe i could read it to you
if i get the position

but thats european football dear
soccer
yes you play soccer too
yeah
oh isnt that amazing
yes i was captain of the womens team
we won three university championships
oh but that was decades ago
but i was more disciplined back then
i always put my studies
ahead of my athletics
im sure youre the same way
im sure you got all
your homework done already
no not exactly
really oh thats a pity
because young men
who dont do their studies
often miss out
on more amusing activities
and who is this young lady
this is lydia
hello lydia
this isnt fair mom
why do we need a housekeeper anyway
oh
this is all i need
look why cant dad do it
excuse me dear
but i dont think its appropriate
to argue with your mother
in front of a perfect stranger
if you dont mind me ssaying so
i just dont see why
we cant spend the extra time with dad
maybe shes right dear
maybe their father would be
a more appropriate person
no i dont think so
really
its not my fault honey
if he would get a job and
a decent apartment
you see hes the kind
excuse me dear
im sure you normally would encourage
the children to step out of the room
before you verbally bash their father hm
if i did that
i might never see them again
im sorry
thats all right
youre right
no harm done
youre absolutely right
im not a therapist
i just see what i see theyre yours
why dont you guys go on upstairs
ill be up in a minute
its lovely to meet you
yeah nice to meet you
you too lydie
oh theyre a spirited bunch
yes
especially that lydie
shes got daggers for you
i know
theyre very upset with me right now
probably the divorce
how did you know
well you can sense it dear
the way she talks about her father
really
i dont think hes in the navy really
the way shes saying she misses him
you know it she wants him here
its like hes nearby
yes
oh thats so sad
would you care to have a cup of tea
id love that
its right in here

to live with
huh
but the children are crazy about him
you dont have to be
a psychic to sense that
my you certainly do know
your way around a kitchen

its our little secret
most of the dinosaurs were herbivorous
but this tyrannosaurus rex
is a carnivore
the reptilelike saurischia
saurischia
and the birdlike
ornithischia
now were going to go
where no human being has ever been
oh no
as we continue our deam with free history
which ones the dinosaur
the one in the middle i think
nah youre wrong theyre all extinct
i cant believe theyre still
subjecting kids to this this is insane
they should have
a little disclaimer that says
do not operate heavy machinery
while watching this show
its incredible
this guy used to put me to sleep
when i was a kid
its amazing
he has the warmth of a snow pea
it makes mr rogers look like mick jagger
thats insane
what kind of idiot kept
this guy on the air for 25 years
me
you
jonathan lundy
jonathan lundy general manager owner
daniel hillard former employee
ah maybe
huh
thats funny
listen ii dont mean to criticize
i just you know sometimes i have
criticize all you want
the shows terrible
oh mr lundry
no im gonna cancel it
its pulling down the whole
afternoon schedule
come on
nah hes gone
you know what you gotta do
what
maybe just um
you know start from scratch
give it kind of uh
maybe a musical number
you know imagine a littlea little
tyrannosaurus rex comes out you know
hillard
yes
get your ass to the truck
that shipments gotta make
a six oclock flight to la
tone this is mr lundy
he knows who i am
yeah
did you ever wish that sometimes you could
freezeframe a single moment in your day
look at it and say this is not my life
miranda
what are you home early for dear
i had an appointment
oh thank you
with the court liaison mrs sellner
oh
i cant believe it
what dear
she says that daniel has
some woman living with him
pretending to be his sister
oh
i told her he doesnt even have a sister
oh mrs sellners probably mistaken
oh shes a social worker dear
really
and besides
how could he replace you
and so quickly
really
shes supposed to be older
and very unattractive
really
oh
mrs doubtfire
yes
did you and mr doubtfire ever
you must have had
your share of problems
oh of course dear
what marriage doesnt
but i always say
the bad times fade away
and the good ones adhere
themselves to your memory
yes excuse me
thats all right
oh
as i hold this cold meat
im reminded of winston
god rest his soul
when did he pass on
eight years ago dear
this november
what happened
he was quite fond of the drink
ah
it was the drink that killed him
how awful
he was an alcoholic
no
he was hit by a guinness truck
so it was quite literally
the drink that killed him
how tragic
yes
oh
but he was a good man though really
a sainted man
and despite his mountains of faults
still i always say a flawed husband
is better than none at all
who needs a husband
when ive got you
oh surely you dont mean that dear
well
oh thats so sweet
you cant imagine what it was like
being married to daniel
tell me dear what was so horrible
about this man you lived with for 14 years
well at first nothing
he was
he was so romantic
so passionate
really
he sounds like an absolute stud dear
oh i hope you dont mind me
being a tad rude but
how was he you know
on a scale of 1 to 10
oh well that part was always
ok
just ok
oh
he was probably a casanova
compared to poor old winston
what was the matter with winston
oh dear
winstons idea of foreplay was
effie brace yourself
it was daniels spontaneity and energy
i fell in love with
really
everyone else i knew
was so organized so scheduled
like me i guess
but daniel was so wonderfully different
and funny he could always make me laugh
i always say the key
to a solid marriage is laughter
but after a few years
everything just stopped being funny
why
i was working all the time and
he was always between jobs
i hardly ever got
to see the kids and
on the night i would try to get home early
to be with them something would go wrong
the house would be wrecked
and id have to clean it up
he never knew but so many nights i just
cried myself to sleep
really
the truth is
i didnt like who i was
when i was with him
i would turn into this horrible person
i didnt want my kids growing up
with a mother like that
when im not with daniel
im better
and
im sure hes better
when hes not with me
well you never
i mean
did you ever say
anything to him dear
daniel never liked
to talk about anything serious
uh
i used to think daniel could do anything
except be serious
but then i was serious enough
for everybody
oh
oh
oh man
this is great
isnt this posh
this is wonderful and amazing
wow
ill bet its very exclusive
probably need a credit reference
just to get in the pool
oh

you guys go
im sorry dad
bye
sorry about the pepper
i was
yeah
what are you lookin at shows over
miss robeson
do you have any closing remarks
nothing further your honor
mr hillard since youve determined
to act as your own attorney
you are entitled to make
a closing statement at this time
your honor in the past two months
ive secured a residence
i refurbished that residence
and made it an environment
fit for children
those are your words
and im also holding down a job
as a shipping clerk
so ii believe i met
your requirements
ahead of schedule
in regards to my behavior
i can only plead insanity
because ever since my children were born
the moment i looked at them
i was crazy about them
once i held them
i was hooked
im addicted to my children sir
i love them with all my heart
and the idea of someone telling me i cant
be with them i cant see them every day
its like someone saying i cant have air
i cant live without air
and i cant live without them
listen i would do anything
i just want to be with them
you know i need that sir
we have a history
and i just
they mean everything to me
and they need me as much as i need them
so please
dont take my kids away from me
thank you
mr hillard
youve been able to fool
a lot of people into believing
that youre a 60yearold woman
no easy task
and your little speech seemed to be
very heartfelt and genuine
but i believe it
to be a terrific performance
by a very gifted actor
nothing more
no its not that
the reality mr hillard
is that your lifestyle over the past month
has been very unorthodox
and i refuse to further subject
three innocent children
to your peculiar
and potentially harmful behavior
it is this courts decision
to award full custody to mrs hillard
oh god
no sir please
you will have supervised
visitation rights every saturday
supervised sir
yes
a court liaison will accompany you
when you spend time with the children
i am suggesting a period of
psychological testing
and perhaps treatment for you mr hillard
we will reexamine this case
one year from now
thank you
court is adjourned
i dont do laundry
i dont do windows i dont do carpets
i dont do bathtubs i dont do toilets
and i dont do diapers
my children have been pottytrained
for quite some time
well i dont do washing
i dont do basements
i dont do dinners
i dont do reading

things were a lot nicer
when she was around
the house was so warm and cosy and
the beds were always made
and the dinner was
she isnt real
we have to stop referring to her
as if she were a real person

you lied to us
you know what
what
i dont wanna do this any more
i dont wanna do any more
who did what to whom
ever since this happened
ive been trying to make sense out of it
and the only thing i know
to be true in my heart
is that the children were happier
when mrs doubtfire
was a part of their lives
yeah
she
she brought out the best in them
she brought out the best in you
and you
yeah
they miss her terribly

dear mrs doubtfire
two months ago my mom and
dad decided to separate
now they live in different houses
my brother andrew says that
we arent a real family any more
is this true
did i lose my family
is there anything i could do
to get my parents back together
sincerely katie mccormick
oh my dear katie
you know some parents
when theyre angry
they get along much better
when they dont live together
they dont fight all the time
and they can become better people
and much better mommies
and daddies for you
and sometimes they get back together
and sometimes they dont dear
and if they dont
dont blame yourself
just because they dont love each other
doesnt mean that they dont love you
there are all sorts of
different families katie
some families have one mommy
some families have one daddy
oror two families
some children live with
their uncle or aunt
some live with their grandparents
and some children live with foster parents
and some live in separate homes
and some in separate neighborhoods
in different areas of the country
they may not see each other for days
weeks months or even years at a time
but if theres love dear
those are the ties that bind
