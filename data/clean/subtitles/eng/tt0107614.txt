thank you  but i m ok  really 
i mean  this is   
this is just a temporary thing 
i know miranda 
it s gonna blow over 
mr and mrs hillard  although these custody
proceedings tend to favor the mother 
we also realize 
perhaps now more than ever 
that it is not in a child s best interest
to deprive him or her
of an obviously loving father 
however  since at the present time
mr hillard has no place to live
and no employment    
it is the court s ruling
to award sole custody to mrs hillard 
  congratulations 
  no 
mr hillard will have
visitation rights every saturday 
  can t you do something 
  he s made his decision 
isn t it traditional to say
 i object  or something 
your honor  please 
you mean  every saturday 
that s one day a week 
that s not enough 
i have to be with my children 
it s not a question  really  i mean 
i have to be with them  sir  please 
i know it seems like a lot 
but for me it s not enough  really 
i haven t been away from  em
for more than one day
since the day they were born 
mr hillard  i would like to add that
this ruling is only temporary 
oh  good 
i will assign a court liaison
to oversee your case 
and there will be a continuance
of these proceedings in 90 days 
  i m giving you three months  mr hillard 
  thank you 
three months in which to get a job 
keep it and create a suitable home 
if this proves to be a possibility for you 
i will consider a joint custody
arrangement when we reconvene 
we re adjourned 
well  it looks like there is a little light
at the end of our tunnel  heh 
  that s all my stuff 
  this is all my fault 
god  no 
why would you think that 
i should have never had a birthday  dad 
  this never would have happened 
  yes  it would 
it was an accident waiting to happen  ok

i was a little liberal with the atomizer 
and at my age  dear  you know 
it s like a good stilton 
everything does have its own aroma 
i admire that honesty  nattie 
that s a noble quality  never lose that 
it often disappears with age
or entering politics 
look at that face 
you remind me of stuart little 
one of the most honorable creatures
in all of literature 
  do you know that book  stuart little 
  yeah  it s one of my favorites 
oh 
mine  too 
maybe i could read it to you  
if i get the position 
  that would be wonderful 
  agree 
and who is this strapping young lad 
  this is chris 
  hello  christopher 
hello 
jeez  you re big for a lady 
you could play for the 49ers 
well  i was a fullback 
but that s european football  dear 
  soccer 
  yes  you play soccer  too 
  yeah 
  oh  isn t that amazing 
yes  i was captain of the women s team 
we won three university championships 
oh  but that was decades ago 
but i was more disciplined back then 
i always put my studies
ahead of my athletics 
i m sure you re the same way 
i m sure you got all
your homework done already 
  no  not exactly 
  really  oh  that s a pity 
because young men
who don t do their studies
often miss out
on more amusing activities 
  and who is this young lady 
  this is lydia 
hello  lydia 
this isn t fair  mom 
why do we need a housekeeper anyway 
oh 
this is all i need 
look  why can t dad do it 
excuse me  dear 
but  i don t think it s appropriate
to argue with your mother
in front of a perfect stranger 
if you don t mind me ssaying so 
i just don t see why
we can t spend the extra time with dad 
maybe she s right  dear 
maybe their father would be
a more appropriate person 
  no  i don t think so 
  really 
it s not my fault  honey 
if he would get a job and
a decent apartment   
  you see  he s the kind   
  excuse me  dear 
i m sure you normally would encourage
the children to step out of the room
before you verbally bash their father  hm 
if i did that 
i might never see them again 
  i m sorry 
  that s all right 
  you re right 
  no harm done 
you re absolutely right 
i m not a therapist 
i just see what i see  they re yours 
why don t you guys go on upstairs 
i ll be up in a minute 
  it s lovely to meet you 
  yeah  nice to meet you 
you too  lydie 
  oh  they re a spirited bunch 
  yes 
especially that lydie 
she s got daggers for you 
i know 
  they re very upset with me right now 
  probably the divorce 
how did you know 
well  you can sense it  dear 
  the way she talks about her father 
  really 
i don t think he s in the navy  really 
the way she s saying she misses him 
you know it  she wants him here 
it s like he s nearby 
  yes 
  oh  that s so sad 
  would you care to have a cup of tea 
  i d love that 
  it s right in here 
  what a lovely home you have 
  did you decorate this yourself 
  yes  i did 
oh  it reeks of taste 
isn t this lovely  dear 
thank you 
  here s my résumé 
  oh  thank you 
  let me start this tea 
  oh  no  dear  let me get that for you 
you ve had a hard day 
 you just sit yourself down there
on that stool and leave the tea to me 
thank you 
that s very nice of you 
oh  not at all  dear 
  oh  what a wonderful résumé 
  oh  thank you  dear 
 expert in first aid and cpr  
and heimlich manoeuvre  dear 
you can never be too prepared when
you got little ones are around  you know 
because they ll swallow anything 
you ve got to be ready to pop it out 
oh  let s see 
oh 
what a perfectly appointed little cubby 
look at this  everything
has its place and name tag 
how precise 
it s lovely 
my husband never appreciated it 
oh  poor dolt 
that s not the reason
you divorced him  was it 
no 
it s so sad  because marriage
can be such a blessing 
so can divorce 
daniel is a very difficult man
to live with 
huh 
but the children are crazy about him 
you don t have to be
a psychic to sense that 
my  you certainly do know
your way around a kitchen 
oh 
it s just because everything
is so accessible 
you designed it 
i m amazed that there isn t
a little label there that says  spoons  
you remind me of someone 
really 
who 
i feel like i ve known you for years 
maybe we knew each other in another life 
i would love for you
to come and work with us 
  so would i 
  great 
oh  it would be an honor 
to us 
to us 
the start of a business relationship

and warm to go home to

most of the dinosaurs were herbivorous 
but this tyrannosaurus rex
is a carnivore 
the reptile like saurischia
saurischia
and the bird like
ornithischia 
now  we re going to go
where no human being has ever been 
oh  no 
as we continue our deam with free history 
which one s the dinosaur 
  the one in the middle  i think 
  nah  you re wrong  they re all extinct 
i can t believe they re still
subjecting kids to this  this is insane 
they should have
a little disclaimer that says 
do not operate heavy machinery
while watching this show 
it s incredible 
this guy used to put me to sleep
when i was a kid 
it s amazing 
he has the warmth of a snow pea 
it makes mr rogers look like mick jagger 
that s insane 
what kind of idiot kept
this guy on the air for 25 years 
me 
you 
jonathan lundy 
jonathan lundy  general manager  owner 
daniel hillard  former employee 
  ah  maybe 
  huh 
that s funny 
listen  i i don t mean to criticize 
i just  you know  sometimes i have   
criticize all you want 
the show s terrible 
  oh  mr lundry   
  no  i m gonna cancel it 
it s pulling down the whole
afternoon schedule 
  come on 
  nah  he s gone 
  you know what you gotta do 
  what 
maybe  just um   
you know  start from scratch 
give it kind of uh   
maybe a musical number 
you know  imagine a little   a little
tyrannosaurus rex comes out you know   
  hillard 
  yes 
get your ass to the truck 
that shipment s gotta make
a six o clock flight to la 
tone  this is mr lundy 
  he knows who i am 
  yeah 
did you ever wish that sometimes you could
freeze frame a single moment in your day 
look at it and say  this is not my life  
miranda 
what are you home early for  dear 
i had an appointment 
oh  thank you 
with the court liaison  mrs sellner 
oh 
  i can t believe it 
  what  dear 
she says that daniel has
some woman living with him 
  pretending to be his sister 
  oh 
i told her he doesn t even have a sister 
oh  mrs sellner s probably mistaken 
oh  she s a social worker  dear 
really 
and besides 
how could he replace you 
and so quickly 
really 
she s supposed to be older
and very unattractive 
really 
oh 
mrs doubtfire 
  yes 
  did you and mr doubtfire ever   
you must have had
your share of problems 
oh  of course  dear 
what marriage doesn t 
but i always say 
the bad times fade away 
and the good ones adhere
themselves to your memory 
  yes  excuse me 
  that s all right 
oh 
as i hold this cold meat 
i m reminded of winston 
god rest his soul 
when did he    pass on 
eight years ago  dear 
this november 
what happened 
  he was quite fond of the drink 
  ah 
it was the drink that killed him 
how awful 
he was an alcoholic 
no 
he was hit by a guinness truck 
so it was quite literally
the drink that killed him 
  how tragic 
  yes 
oh 
but he was a good man  though  really 
a sainted man 
and despite his mountains of faults 
still i always say  a flawed husband
is better than none at all 
who needs a husband
when i ve got you 
oh  surely you don t mean that  dear 
  well   
  oh  that s so sweet 
you can t imagine what it was like
being married to daniel 
tell me  dear  what was so horrible
about this man you lived with for 14 years 
well  at first  nothing 
he was   
he was so    romantic 
  so passionate 
  really 
he sounds like an absolute stud  dear 
oh  i hope you don t mind me
being a tad rude  but   
how was he    you know   
on a scale of 1 to 10 
oh  well  that part was always   
ok 
just ok 
oh 
he was probably a casanova
compared to poor old winston 
  what was the matter with winston 
  oh  dear 
winston s idea of foreplay was
 effie  brace yourself   
it was daniel s spontaneity and energy
i fell in love with 
really 
everyone else i knew
was so organized  so scheduled 
like me  i guess 
but daniel was so wonderfully different 
and funny  he could always make me laugh 
i always say  the key
to a solid marriage is laughter 
but after a few years 
everything just stopped being funny 
why 
i was working all the time and   
he was always between jobs 
i hardly ever got
to see the kids and   
on the night i would try to get home early
to be with them  something would go wrong 
the house would be wrecked
and i d have to clean it up 
he never knew  but so many nights i just   
cried myself to sleep 
really 
the truth is    
i didn t like who i was
when i was with him 
i would turn into this horrible person 
i didn t want my kids growing up
with a mother like that 
when i m not with daniel 
i m better 
and   
i m sure he s better
when he s not with me 
well  you never   
i mean   
did you ever say
anything to him  dear 
daniel never liked
to talk about anything serious 
uh   
i used to think daniel could do anything 
except be serious 
but then  i was serious enough
for everybody 
  oh 
  oh 
  oh  man 
  this is great 
  isn t this posh 
  this is wonderful and amazing 
  wow 
  i ll bet it s very exclusive 
probably need a credit reference
just to get in the pool 
  oh 
  oh 
  amazing 
  oh  nattie 
not a single body that exists in nature 
look at that 
  lydie   
  there s stu 
where 
oh  on the board there 
oh  isn t he a stunning piece of work 
look  nattie 
that s called liposuction  hmm 
  wow 
  wow 
i hope he had protection  you know 
he hit the water at that speed 
god knows what happened 
  oh  let let s go say hi 
  let s do  please 
  that s amazing 
  stunning 
oh  whoa  whoa

  you guys go 
  i m sorry  dad 
bye 
sorry about the pepper 
i was   
yeah 
what are you lookin  at  show s over 
miss robeson 
do you have any closing remarks 
nothing further  your honor 
mr hillard  since you ve determined
to act as your own attorney 
you are entitled to make
a closing statement at this time 
your honor  in the past two months 
i ve secured a residence 
i refurbished that residence 
and made it  an environment
fit for children  
those are your words 
and i m also holding down a job
as a shipping clerk 
so i i believe i met
your requirements 
ahead of schedule 
in regards to my behavior 
i can only plead insanity 
because  ever since my children were born 
the moment i looked at them 
i was crazy about them 
once i held them 
i was hooked 
i m addicted to my children  sir 
i love them with all my heart 
and the idea of someone telling me i can t
be with them  i can t see them every day   
it s like someone saying i can t have air 
i can t live without air 
and i can t live without them 
listen  i would do anything 
i just want to be with them 
you know i need that  sir 
we have a history 
and i just   
they mean everything to me 
and they need me as much as i need them 
so  please 
don t take my kids away from me 
thank you 
mr hillard   
you ve been able to fool
a lot of people into believing
that you re a 60 year old woman 
no easy task 
and your little speech seemed to be
very heartfelt and genuine 
but i believe it
to be a terrific performance
by a very gifted actor 
nothing more 
  no  it s not that 
  the reality  mr hillard 
is that your lifestyle over the past month
has been very unorthodox 
and i refuse to further subject
three innocent children
to your peculiar
and potentially harmful behavior 
it is this court s decision
to award full custody to mrs hillard 
oh  god 
no  sir  please 
you will have supervised
visitation rights every saturday 
  supervised  sir 
  yes 
a court liaison will accompany you
when you spend time with the children 
i am suggesting a period of
psychological testing
and perhaps treatment for you  mr hillard 
we will re examine this case
one year from now 
thank you 
court is adjourned 
i don t do laundry 
i don t do windows  i don t do carpets 
i don t do bathtubs  i don t do toilets 
and i don t do diapers 
my children have been potty trained
for quite some time

oh  guys  please don t be so depressed

  i miss her jokes 
i miss her stories 
don t worry  we will find someone 
there are plenty of people out there 
nobody like her 
all right  i admit 
things were a lot nicer
when she was around 
the house was so warm and cosy and   
the beds were always made 
and the dinner was   
she isn t real 
we have to stop referring to her
as if she were a real person

jesus  miranda 
you took my children away from me 
i can only see them now with supervision 
some woman watches me with the kids
like i m some sort of deviant 
if i try to hug them 
she wonders why 
you know what that s like 
you just sat there in that courtroom 
you knew the truth  you didn t say a word 
you let that judge pass
that despicable sentence 
  i was angry 
  oh  god 
look  you hurt me  too 
oh  you ripped my heart out 
and you come back to do it again 
you lied to us 
  you know what 
  what 
i don t wanna do this any more 
i don t wanna do any more
 who did what to whom  
ever since this happened 
i ve been trying to make sense out of it 
and the only thing i know
to be true in my heart
is that the children were happier
when mrs doubtfire
was a part of their lives 
yeah 
she   
she brought out the best in them 
she brought out the best in you 
and you 
yeah 
they miss her terribly

see you 
 dear mrs doubtfire  
 two months ago my mom and
dad decided to separate   
 now they live in different houses   
 my brother andrew says that
we aren t a real family any more  
 is this true  
 did i lose my family  
 is there anything i could do
to get my parents back together  
 sincerely  katie mccormick   
oh  my dear katie 
you know  some parents
when they re angry 
they get along much better
when they don t live together 
they don t fight all the time
and they can become better people 
and much better mommies
and daddies for you 
and sometimes they get back together 
and sometimes they don t  dear 
and if they don t 
don t blame yourself 
just because they don t love each other
doesn t mean that they don t love you 
there are all sorts of
different families  katie 
some families have one mommy 
some families have one daddy 
or or two families 
some children live with
their uncle or aunt 
some live with their grandparents 
and some children live with foster parents 
and some live in separate homes
and some in separate neighborhoods
in different areas of the country 
they may not see each other for days 
weeks  months or even years at a time 
but if there s love  dear 
those are the ties that bind
