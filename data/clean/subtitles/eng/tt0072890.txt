police are questioning leon shermer 
a 26 year old admitted homosexual   
   who claims to have married
one of the bank robbers last november 
according to sources in the barbershop
where leon is being held   
   leon has reportedly said   
   they were married in an
official ceremony by a father burke

a still photograph of leon in his gown 
leon has confirmed   
   that the gowns for himself
and his bridesmaids cost  700 
we have not confirmed the story   
   with the priest  but we are told
that he was subsequently defrocked 
phone calls have arrived from
various factions of the gay community 
some in support of sonny and his
actions  others totally condemning   
   the present events
and calling the marriage a farce

of sheer exhibitionism    end quote
