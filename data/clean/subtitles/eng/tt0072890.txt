police are questioning leon shermer
a 26yearold admitted homosexual
who claims to have married
one of the bank robbers last november
according to sources in the barbershop
where leon is being held
leon has reportedly said
they were married in an
official ceremony by a father burke
leons story has been confirmed
seven bridesmaids all male
sonnys mother and 70 other guests
all members of the gay community
were present
weve been able to obtain
a still photograph of leon in his gown
leon has confirmed
that the gowns for himself
and his bridesmaids cost 700
we have not confirmed the story
with the priest but we are told
that he was subsequently defrocked
phone calls have arrived from
various factions of the gay community
some in support of sonny and his
actions others totally condemning
the present events
and calling the marriage a farce
and quote a case
of sheer exhibitionism  end quote
