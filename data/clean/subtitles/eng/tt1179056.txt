   they should all gather
into the gates cf the city   
while his naval fleet picked off the spartans by sea 
now  it was to be a slow
but sure victory 
the spartans would never make it over the walls of the acropolis  pericles said 
  but what he didn t take into account is that the plague would eventually strike 
open your bucks to page 84 
to further complicate matters   
   the spartans were armed
with a variety cf weapons   
   some cf them even improvised 
and they would not hesitate to slaughter
every athenian they saw   
   even
children 
especially the children cf soldiers

nancy  look  you re running on fumes  here  okay  are you sure  it s  
yeah  i m fine for now 
i didn t take you for the religious type 
yeah  well  you gotta believe
in something  you know 
what s this one doing here 
it s the pied piper of hamelin 
i saw it in one of my dreams  it s about
a guy who s betrayed by a town   
   and he gets his revenge
by taking all their children 
i keep dreaming about children too 
and then there s also a school 
well  it s gotta mean something 
yeah  but  i mean  what  we didn t go to
school together until  like  6th grade 
 look  we re running cut cf time 
 what do you mean 
nightmares are triggered by the belief
that the dreamer has no control   
   and this can cause insomnia 
but then it says at the 70 hour mark   
   the insomniac will begin
to experience micronaps 
 his brain will shut down its functions
for seconds in an attempt to recharge  
this basically means that you re dreaming 
but you don t know it 
like  even if you re awake 
and then it says that after that 
your brain will shut down  inducing a coma 
which is permanent sleep 
nancy 
nancy 
nancy
