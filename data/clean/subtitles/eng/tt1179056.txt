who told the athenian people
they should all gather
into the gates cf the city
while his naval fleet picked off the spartans by sea
now it was to be a slow
but sure victory
the spartans would never make it over the walls of the acropolis pericles said
but what he didnt take into account is that the plague would eventually strike
open your bucks to page 84
to further complicate matters
the spartans were armed
with a variety cf weapons
some cf them even improvised
and they would not hesitate to slaughter
every athenian they saw
even
children
especially the children cf soldiers

ive been on it since i was like 15
no no no thanks
nancy look youre running on fumes here okay are you sure its
yeah im fine for now
i didnt take you for the religious type
yeah well you gotta believe
in something you know
whats this one doing here
its the pied piper of hamelin
i saw it in one of my dreams its about
a guy whos betrayed by a town
and he gets his revenge
by taking all their children
i keep dreaming about children too
and then theres also a school
well its gotta mean something
yeah but i mean what we didnt go to
school together until like 6th grade
look were running cut cf time
what do you mean
nightmares are triggered by the belief
that the dreamer has no control
and this can cause insomnia
but then it says at the 70hour mark
the insomniac will begin
to experience micronaps
his brain will shut down its functions
for seconds in an attempt to recharge
this basically means that youre dreaming
but you dont know it
like even if youre awake
and then it says that after that
your brain will shut down inducing a coma
which is permanent sleep
nancy
nancy
nancy
