table seven  that s your karma

  ok 
 wolf whistle 
you wouldn t happen to have
a spare cigarette 
  i m on the phone 
  who s that you re talking to 
oh  nothing 
it s just a guy asking for a cigarette 
  ok  i better go 
  yeah 
  bye 
  hmm 
  ok  ok  bye 
  have you got a light 
how about board and lodging 
while we re at it 
nah  i don t even know your name 
do you have one  though 
shit 
oh  dear 
i m michael 
i work in the restaurant there 
  all right  sailor 
  i m a chef 
good for you 
come on  guys  what have we got 
we ve checked all the scottish cases
but have no obvious matches 
no proteins mutating  no prions  nothing 
there s nothing to say it s a virus 
nothing that matches anything we know 
but it s fair to say
it isn t obviously contagious 
it s fair to say it s spreading 
ok 
could be environmental  it could be
a toxin we know nothing about 
it could be terrorism 
ok  so it s not a contagion 
i ll tell them    probably disappear
in a short while and don t panic 
maybe they put something in the water 
overwhelmed with grief 
people are hit with all
that they ve lost 
lovers they never had 
all the departed friends 
they think of all the
people they ve hurt 
first  overwhelmed with grief 
and then no sense of smell 
that s the disease 
they call it severe
olfactory syndrome 
sos 
tv  this is a cause for concern and
requires a heightened state of alert 
but it s not a cause for alarm 
 news reports in various languages 
we stand ready for the arrival
of the first confirmed
case of infection   
  the world health organization s
stepping to level five
doesn t automatically mean
that the human race   
they say it isn t contagious 
but who dare believe that 
nothing 
well  shall we call it a night 
i don t know what the fuck
we should call it 
let s go chase some pretty ladies  huh 
  you chase  i ll pick up the pieces 
  i don t feel like it 
come on 
you want to watch that  rich 
that s what happens when you have
too much high class fanny 
he s been gorging himself
on europe s finest 
  i m going to get the entonox quick 
  what s that 
entonox  laughing gas  saint nitrous 
patron saint of pastry chefs 
richard  don t  it ll make you feel   
james  leave him alone 
  ssh 
  james 
  i recommend it for you especially  sir 
  put it back 
what  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait 
stop  stop  stop 
sniff my finger 
yeah  i can smell that  oranges 
wrong  balls 
man down  man down 
quickly  evacuate  evacuate 
  good night 
  see you later 
  see you later  boss 
  cheers  boys 
good night 
  keep smiling 
  good night  james 
  got your own smokes tonight  sailor 
  i m still a chef 
my dad called everybody sailor 
he worked in the docks all his life 
he never went sailing anywhere
but he called everybody sailor 
all right 
even people he didn t know 
 hello  sailor    goodbye  sailor  
well  you can call me sailor  if you like 
or michael 
when i was a child 
i thought it was really embarrassing 
now i m doing it myself 
are you hungry 
people aren t eating in restaurants these
days and we ve got a lot of spare food 
hm 
this is    monkfish cheek 
fish is my thing 
  good 
  mmm 
mm 
 they laugh 
  i m a bit greedy when i eat 
  oh  that s all right 
i had a disorder when i was younger 
just trying to catch up 
so what do you do   
when you re not eating 
  death and misery 
  what 
i m an epidemiologist 
i ll get you something sweet 
this is a mango jelly
and chocolate macaroons 
and   
i didn t make these 
i can t remember what the fuck
that s called  but it s got coconut in it 
god   
all that sailor stuff 
it reminds me of him 
my dad 
i miss him so much 
we had so much fun together 
he could always make me laugh 
hey    hey 
let me get you   
here  this is    this is clean 
thank you   blows nose 
ok 
 sobs 
here  here  you re all right 
do not stand so close  you never know 
  oh  no  they say it s not contagious 
  we don t know 
it s just something we tell people 
look    would you    would you like me
to take you back to your home 
yeah  come on 
you take the cloth  i ll get the   
come on  come on 
 rain falling 
 she sobs 
 stifled sobbing 
 he sobs 
oh   
  hey 
  it s gone 
the smell 
all gone 
well  i think i ll   
that was a crazy evening 
yeah 
 clicks tongue 
good morning 
 sniffs 
mmm  well  it has its benefits 
  yep 
 he sniffs 
we were in the algarve once 
maggie and me 
came home  had a freezer full of food 
there d been a power cut 
never smelt anything so disgusting
in my life 
i ll never forget it 
maybe you will 
hm 
i ve met someone 
  oh  ok 
  i m pathetic 
mm hm 
i m not even sure i like him 
ok 
i actually think he s a smooth arsehole 
now   
it ll probably come back 
but at the moment our customers
won t be able to smell  so   
it ll be like cooking
for snotty nosed people 
bring out the big guns  all right 
maybe a bit of saffron 
oregano 
richard  can you get me a clean apple 
life goes on 
the food becomes spicier   
  saltier   
more sweet   
more sour 
you get used to it 
the greater loss are all the memories
that are no longer triggered 
ooh hoo 
smell and memory
were connected in the brain 
cinnamon might have reminded you
of your grandmother s apron 
the scent of cut hay
could evoke a childhood fear of cows 
diesel oil might bring back memories
of your first ferry crossing 
without smell 
an ocean of past images disappears 
whoa 
 he whistles 
 whistles again 
i m off work 
congratulations 
  are you ok 
  yeah 
any more news on death and misery 
not really 
i was a really good smeller 
  i bet you were 
  i was 
do you want a cigarette 
  no  thanks 
  something else  then 
  like what 
  oh  er    are you hungry 
nah 
i could cook you something special 
or buy you a lollipop 
we could go for a coffee
and eat apple pie and er    liquorice 
a glass of wine 
some fresh air 
come on 
 violin music 
my sister got married here
a few years ago
and i came to stay for a month and   
  met a guy 
  and then a good job came up 
and now  ladies and gentlemen 
we ll call upon a new smell 
the scent of the forest
after the spring rain 
we imagine the path
underneath our feet 
we see the green moist color
surrounding us 
and we feel the wet branches
against our faces 
and now imagine   
  oh   
  we pass between the trees 
  i m not going on my own  come on 
  oh  no 
and we begin drawing in the air 
deep inside 
and enjoy the moment 
the humidity level is high 
 plays dramatic tune 
at the lower end there is the moss 
the fungi  the rotten leaves 
the middle tone is the tall  fresh grass 
a crisp and almost invigorating scent 
 plucks high notes 
and at the top we feel
not only the leaves and the rainwater 
but also the sky 
 high  ringing note 
on a day like this   
we can smell the sky itself 
 mellow tune 
what shall we do now 
well  now you could invite me
back to your place 
don t know if i will 
well  you    you can just start
walking home   
  and i ll follow you 
 she laughs 
  oh 
 they laugh 
 sniffs 
mm 
i should have made a bigger effort
to sniff you
the first time we were lying here 
mm 
a pity 
what do you want 
what do i want 
yeah 
well  soon i d like to close my eyes
and try and go to sleep 
which is a big deal for me cos usually
i    i can t sleep in bed with someone 
i need to be by myself 
ok 
  now 
  now  yes 
you want me to leave 
i live here  so i guess you ll have to 
  now 
  yes  please 
did i say something wrong 
ah    let me give you my    card 
in case you want to  you know   
call me or something 
you have a card 
i had a catering company
that didn t do very well 
not very many clients  lots of cards 
you can call me 
my number s on there  and my address 
and i guess you know
where i work  so   
 door bangs 
man  repent  sinners 
the day of the lord is upon you 
do you know that this is
the day of the lord 
the prophecy has been spoken 
do you pray 
are you aware of your sins 
come back and be aware 
this is the day of the prophecy 
hello 
no flowers 
she loved flowers  michael 
ian got married   
in a church with the full monty 
eugh 
apparently  she s pregnant  his bride 
and what about this michael 
what about him 
he sounds nice 
i don t know 
i usually pick arseholes 
well  they can t all be arseholes 
they just can t 
  i m trying to take care of myself 
  right 
you do that a lot  don t you 
  fuck you  sailor 
 laughs 
 children clamouring 
can i have sweets 
let me see 
hmm   
  ta da 
  whoo 
  what do you say 
  one for you and one for you 
not soap 
big soap  big soap 
apparently  big tobacco and
big fizzy cola have formed this cartel
to start selling wait for it
fruity flavoured oxygen 
in order to create a proper market for it 
they ve enlisted big soap 
big soap have flooded the environment
with enough organophosphates
to temporarily disable
your central nervous system 
that s why i ve stopped washing   
in case you were wondering
what the smell was 
you don t half talk some shite 
environmental groups are sure it s
the start of an ecological apocalypse
caused by pollution and genetically
modified plants and hormones 
intelligence claims
it s an attack on the free world 
all indicators point
to fundamentalists 
the fundamentalists talk of god s
punishment on a world of unbelievers   
and promise that all pure people
of the right faith
will regain their sense of smell
in the final days 
others talk of the degenerate
capitalist system
that has released a military virus
to stimulate the economy 
and there are other theories 
 shouting 
stephen  wake up 
there is so much hatred in the world 
there s so much hatred 
  easy 
  so much hatred in the world 
  they re fucking plotting against us 
  stephen  calm down 
they want to blow us up 
they want to destroy us 
fucking so much   
  so much hatred 
  ssh  ssh 
there 
so many sharp edges 
so many sharp edges 
  that s ok 
  sharp things 
i ve just given him
as much sedative as i dare 
  so many sharp edges 
  it ll kick in in a second 
so many sharp edges 
  normally so soft  we are so soft 
  it s all right 
 distant shouts 
 panting 
hey  are you all right 
i can t die alone 
i m here with you  i m barbara 
i work in research 
  i ve seen you in the canteen 
  that s how it ll end 
without anybody loving me 
come on  now  just calm down 
what s your name 
oh  no 
see  the thing is  your body  ok 
it betrays    it betrays itself 
  stop  michael 
  no  no  listen 
your body 
it takes away the color of your skin 
and    and betrays your    your spirit 
michael  stop 
can i get some water over here 
that s ok  it s ok 
pissing and bleeding and fucking puss
is coming out of your ear 
  there s no puss 
  i ve seen it  i ve seen it 
at the end  you re all alone 
don t say that 
you die on your own and it gets all dark 
it s not true  don t say that 
you re not on your own 
you re not on your own 
all your body  it turns   
it turns to fucking soup 
first the terror 
don t leave me  don t leave me  michael 
don t leave me 
and then a moment of hunger 
oh  my god  what s happened 
oh  my god  what s happened 
what s happening 
 horn blares 
 groans 
this is how the sense of taste
disappears from our world 
they don t even have time
to give the disease a name 
 dog barks in distance 
 dog barks in distance 
do you think
we ll lose our other senses too 
smell and taste are related 
they re the two chemical senses 
so the other ones
might be all right  then 
they might 
just have to wait and see 
that s right  sailor 
and what happens if you re wrong 
 whispers  
then we re fucked 
hey 
hi 
it s still out there 
what is 
the world 
what can you see 
people 
what are they doing 
they re heading off to work 
what should we do 
we go to work as well 
do we kiss each other first   
maybe 
  say we d like to see each other again 
we probably do 
maybe even this evening 
maybe 
and are we looking forward to that 
yes 
i may not even have a job any more 
forget it  michael  we re closed 
we re closed 
we ll open again 
people can t smell  they can t taste 
they re going to buy flour and fat 
that s all you need to survive 
take a hit on that  go on  go on 
drink that 
now  that is damned expensive brandy 
damned  damned expensive 
but you might as well
drink surgical spirit or sniff glue 
it doesn t matter 
flour and fat 
  and yet it does matter 
  there s no difference 
no  i think you re wrong 
life goes on 
 exhales heavily 
they ll come back 
people will ask each other
out to dinner again 
they ll toast each other
while we take care of their needs 
  yeah  and serve them flour and fat 
  no  anything but flour and fat 
we ll be all right 
slowly things return to normal
and life goes on 
people do what they did before
as best they can 
 crunches 
 crunches 
within a few weeks 
taste becomes a distant memory 
and different sensations
take its place 
 bagpipes play 
 sighs 
in restaurants  it s all about offering
another person dinner 
letting yourself be waited on 
listening to the trickle of wine
and the clink of glasses 
 not only has the food
received special attention 
but also the temperature of the food
and its consistency 
and we tried it all 
from the freezing cold
to the scorching hot 
it was dry  it was moist  it was crisp 
it was spongy  it was crunchy
and it was all at the highest level 
up to and including the dessert   
a light pudding with caramelized knots
and a bright orange sorbet 
and a dark blue    dark blue coulis
on blackberries and blackcurrant  
chew on that 
great 
life goes on 
my dad let me shave him once 
i was eight 
i managed to do it
without a single scratch 
i was very proud 
and then   
he went to the sink
and he shaved himself all over again
as if i hadn t been there 
i was devastated 
your turn 
 laughs 
here  try  it s soft 
  mmm 
  yeah 
mmm  mmm 
  want to go dancing 
  sure 
  and get drunk 
  sure 
  and smoke cigarettes 
  always 
  there s still pleasures in the world  eh 
  let s have them  all of them 
here 
 giggles 
oh   laughs 
i got soap in my eye 
  castanets 
no voice was raised  
  no one sentenced us  
let s play a game  sailor 
what game 
it s called   make me special  
what are the rules 
only one 
just tell me something 
something    
something other people
don t know about you 
  something secret 
  like what 
  unpoliced  
my sister s got two kids
and sometimes i hate them 
  we drew uncertain breath  
  the loss piled high unchecked  
i can t have children 
my ovaries are crippled 
my eggs are no good 
because of not eating 
i pretend that i m not that into them 
that i have an interesting job 
anyway   
  i can t have them 
your turn 
  no one jailed us  
i had a girlfriend 
you don t get this game  do you 
no  we had erm    a wedding planned 
and she got sick 
she got really sick 
you could smell there was something
wrong inside her  like something damp 
something from a basement 
i didn t stay with her 
i didn t look after her  i ran away 
i make myself go and visit her grave 
at first it was once a week
and then maybe it was once a month
and now less 
i go there to feel guilty  you know 
i thought i would feel guilty
for the rest of my life but   
  actually it s starting to fade 
  and no song was sung  
  you re an arsehole 
  i am 
  no voice was raised  
it works 
it works 
you re making me yours 
  i m an arsehole 
  so am i 
a couple of arseholes 
mr and mrs arsehole 
  no song was sung  
so this is the situation
here in bangkok  thailand 
we call it severe
hearing loss syndrome 
and we still do not
know much about it 
anger  rage  hate 
and then they go deaf 
and how does it spread 
i can t hear you very well but  do not
know what to do  tell me what to do 
 sound cuts out and distorts 
  standing there looking at me 
 sound distortion increases 
why are you just looking at me 
 distorted shouting 
you help us now 
 sounds cuts in and out 
  help us now 
  send some help quick 
send some help now 
i think it s ok to panic now 
and that s basically
what the world does 
severe hearing loss syndrome 
spreads from thailand 
across india to china 
russia and beyond 
rage 
anger 
hatred 
and then the loss of another sense 
all the unaffected can do is wait 
ta da 
  can you still get film for those 
  yeah  i got some from my uncle 
 camera whirs 
he was a collector 
what did he collect 
polaroid cameras 
here

there are two movements now 
there are the people who run through
the streets  grabbing all they can 
people who don t believe in anything
but the end of the world 
then there s the other movement   
farmers going out to
milk their cows   
  soldiers reporting for duty 
those who believe
that life will go on somehow   
  or just don t know
what else to do 
 faint vibrations 
 faint reverberations 
 faint thrum of vibrations 
people prepare for the worst   
  but hope for the best 
they concentrate on the things
that are important to them 
 soundless 
all the things beyond fat and flour 
 soundless 
once we thought of the ice age
as something that crept up   
glaciers slowly spreading   
temperatures gradually dropping 
but recently a number of intact
mammoths have been discovered
with stomachs full of
undigested grass 
the cold must have hit them
like a blow from a club 
 deep rumbling 
that s how the darkness
descends upon the world 
but first the shining moments 
a shared flinching
of the brain s temporal lobe 
a profound appreciation
of what it means to be alive 
but most of all  a shared urge
to reach out to one another 
to offer warmth   
  understanding   
  acceptance   
  forgiveness   
  love

it s dark now   
but they feel each other s breath   
and they know all they need to know 
they kiss   
and they feel each other s tears
on their cheeks 
and if there had been
anybody left to see them 
then they would look like normal lovers
caressing each other s faces   
  bodies close together   
eyes closed
