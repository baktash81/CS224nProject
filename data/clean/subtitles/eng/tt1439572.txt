im michael
i work in the restaurant there
all right sailor
im a chef
good for you
come on guys what have we got
weve checked all the scottish cases
but have no obvious matches
no proteins mutating no prions nothing
theres nothing to say its a virus
nothing that matches anything we know
but its fair to say
it isnt obviously contagious
its fair to say its spreading
ok
could be environmental it could be
a toxin we know nothing about
it could be terrorism
ok so its not a contagion
ill tell them probably disappear
in a short while and dont panic
maybe they put something in the water
overwhelmed with grief
people are hit with all
that theyve lost
lovers they never had
all the departed friends
they think of all the
people theyve hurt
first overwhelmed with grief
and then no sense of smell
thats the disease
they call it severe
olfactory syndrome
sos
tv this is a cause for concern and
requires a heightened state of alert
but its not a cause for alarm
news reports in various languages
we stand ready for the arrival
of the first confirmed
case of infection
the world health organizations
stepping to level five
doesnt automatically mean
that the human race
they say it isnt contagious
but who dare believe that
nothing
well shall we call it a night
i dont know what the fuck
we should call it
lets go chase some pretty ladies huh
you chase ill pick up the pieces
i dont feel like it
come on
you want to watch that rich

my dad
i miss him so much
we had so much fun together
he could always make me laugh
hey hey
let me get you

rain falling
she sobs
stifled sobbing
he sobs
oh

all gone
well i think ill
that was a crazy evening
yeah
clicks tongue
good morning
sniffs
mmm well it has its benefits
yep
he sniffs
we were in the algarve once
maggie and me
came home had a freezer full of food
thered been a power cut
never smelt anything so disgusting
in my life
ill never forget it
maybe you will
hm
ive met someone
oh ok
im pathetic
mmhm
im not even sure i like him
ok
i actually think hes a smooth arsehole
now
itll probably come back
but at the moment our customers
wont be able to smell so
itll be like cooking
for snottynosed people
bring out the big guns all right
maybe a bit of saffron
oregano
richard can you get me a clean apple
life goes on
the food becomes spicier
saltier
more sweet
more sour
you get used to it
the greater loss are all the memories
that are no longer triggered
oohhoo
smell and memory
were connected in the brain
cinnamon might have reminded you
of your grandmothers apron
the scent of cut hay
could evoke a childhood fear of cows
diesel oil might bring back memories
of your first ferry crossing
without smell
an ocean of past images disappears
whoa
he whistles
whistles again
im off work
congratulations
are you ok
yeah
any more news on death and misery
not really
i was a really good smeller
i bet you were
i was
do you want a cigarette
no thanks
something else then
like what
oh er are you hungry
nah
i could cook you something special
or buy you a lollipop
we could go for a coffee
and eat apple pie and er liquorice
a glass of wine
some fresh air
come on
violin music
my sister got married here
a few years ago
and i came to stay for a month and
met a guy
and then a good job came up
and now ladies and gentlemen
well call upon a new smell
the scent of the forest
after the spring rain
we imagine the path
underneath our feet
we see the green moist color
surrounding us
and we feel the wet branches
against our faces
and now imagine
oh
we pass between the trees
im not going on my own come on
oh no
and we begin drawing in the air
deep inside
and enjoy the moment
the humidity level is high
plays dramatic tune
at the lower end there is the moss
the fungi the rotten leaves
the middle tone is the tall fresh grass
a crisp and almost invigorating scent
plucks high notes
and at the top we feel
not only the leaves and the rainwater
but also the sky
high ringing note
on a day like this
we can smell the sky itself
mellow tune
what shall we do now
well now you could invite me
back to your place
dont know if i will
well you you can just start
walking home
and ill follow you
she laughs
oh
they laugh
sniffs
mm
i should have made a bigger effort
to sniff you
the first time we were lying here
mm
a pity
what do you want
what do i want
yeah
well soon id like to close my eyes
and try and go to sleep
which is a big deal for me cos usually
i i cant sleep in bed with someone
i need to be by myself
ok
now
now yes
you want me to leave
i live here so i guess youll have to
now
yes please
did i say something wrong
ah let me give you my card
in case you want to you know
call me or something
you have a card
i had a catering company
that didnt do very well
not very many clients lots of cards
you can call me
my numbers on there and my address
and i guess you know
where i work so
door bangs
man repent sinners
the day of the lord is upon you
do you know that this is
the day of the lord
the prophecy has been spoken
do you pray
are you aware of your sins
come back and be aware
this is the day of the prophecy
hello
no flowers
she loved flowers michael
ian got married
in a church with the full monty
eugh
apparently shes pregnant his bride
and what about this michael
what about him
he sounds nice
i dont know
i usually pick arseholes
well they cant all be arseholes
they just cant
im trying to take care of myself
right
you do that a lot dont you
fuck you sailor
laughs
children clamouring
can i have sweets
let me see
hmm
tada
whoo
what do you say
one for you and one for you
not soap
big soap big soap
apparently big tobacco and
big fizzy cola have formed this cartel
to start selling wait for it
fruity flavoured oxygen
in order to create a proper market for it
theyve enlisted big soap
big soap have flooded the environment
with enough organophosphates
to temporarily disable
your central nervous system
thats why ive stopped washing
in case you were wondering
what the smell was
you dont half talk some shite
environmental groups are sure its
the start of an ecological apocalypse
caused by pollution and genetically
modified plants and hormones
intelligence claims
its an attack on the free world
all indicators point
to fundamentalists
the fundamentalists talk of gods
punishment on a world of unbelievers
and promise that all pure people
of the right faith
will regain their sense of smell
in the final days
others talk of the degenerate
capitalist system
that has released a military virus
to stimulate the economy
and there are other theories
shouting
stephen wake up
there is so much hatred in the world
theres so much hatred
easy
so much hatred in the world
theyre fucking plotting against us
stephen calm down
they want to blow us up
they want to destroy us
fucking so much
so much hatred
ssh ssh
there
so many sharp edges
so many sharp edges
thats ok
sharp things
ive just given him
as much sedative as i dare
so many sharp edges
itll kick in in a second
so many sharp edges
normally so soft we are so soft
its all right
distant shouts
panting
hey are you all right
i cant die alone
im here with you im barbara
i work in research
ive seen you in the canteen
thats how itll end
without anybody loving me
come on now just calm down
whats your name
oh no
see the thing is your body ok
it betrays it betrays itself
stop michael
no no listen
your body
it takes away the color of your skin
and and betrays your your spirit
michael stop
can i get some water over here
thats ok its ok
pissing and bleeding and fucking puss
is coming out of your ear
theres no puss
ive seen it ive seen it
at the end youre all alone
dont say that
you die on your own and it gets all dark
its not true dont say that
youre not on your own
youre not on your own
all your body it turns
it turns to fucking soup
first the terror
dont leave me dont leave me michael
dont leave me
and then a moment of hunger
oh my god whats happened
oh my god whats happened
whats happening
horn blares
groans
this is how the sense of taste
disappears from our world
they dont even have time
to give the disease a name
dog barks in distance
dog barks in distance
do you think
well lose our other senses too
smell and taste are related
theyre the two chemical senses
so the other ones
might be all right then
they might
just have to wait and see
thats right sailor
and what happens if youre wrong
whispers
then were fucked
hey
hi
its still out there
what is
the world
what can you see
people
what are they doing
theyre heading off to work
what should we do
we go to work as well
do we kiss each other first
maybe
say wed like to see each other again
we probably do
maybe even this evening
maybe
and are we looking forward to that
yes
i may not even have a job any more
forget it michael were closed
were closed
well open again
people cant smell they cant taste
theyre going to buy flour and fat
thats all you need to survive
take a hit on that go on go on
drink that
now that is damned expensive brandy
damned damned expensive
but you might as well
drink surgical spirit or sniff glue
it doesnt matter
flour and fat
and yet it does matter
theres no difference
no i think youre wrong
life goes on
exhales heavily
theyll come back
people will ask each other
out to dinner again
theyll toast each other
while we take care of their needs
yeah and serve them flour and fat
no anything but flour and fat
well be all right
slowly things return to normal
and life goes on
people do what they did before
as best they can
crunches
crunches
within a few weeks
taste becomes a distant memory
and different sensations
take its place
bagpipes play
sighs
in restaurants its all about offering
another person dinner
letting yourself be waited on
listening to the trickle of wine
and the clink of glasses
not only has the food
received special attention
but also the temperature of the food
and its consistency
and we tried it all
from the freezing cold
to the scorching hot
it was dry it was moist it was crisp
it was spongy it was crunchy
and it was all at the highest level
up to and including the dessert
a light pudding with caramelized knots
and a bright orange sorbet
and a dark blue dark blue coulis
on blackberries and blackcurrant
chew on that
great
life goes on
my dad let me shave him once
i was eight
i managed to do it
without a single scratch
i was very proud
and then
he went to the sink
and he shaved himself all over again
as if i hadnt been there
i was devastated
your turn
laughs
here try its soft
mmm
yeah
mmm mmm
want to go dancing
sure
and get drunk
sure
and smoke cigarettes
always
theres still pleasures in the world eh
lets have them all of them
here
giggles
oh laughs
i got soap in my eye
castanets
no voice was raised
noone sentenced us
lets play a game sailor
what game
its called make me special
what are the rules
only one
just tell me something
something
something other people
dont know about you
something secret
like what
unpoliced
my sisters got two kids
and sometimes i hate them
we drew uncertain breath
the loss piled high unchecked
i cant have children
my ovaries are crippled
my eggs are no good
because of not eating
i pretend that im not that into them
that i have an interesting job
anyway
i cant have them
your turn
noone jailed us
i had a girlfriend
you dont get this game do you
no we had erm a wedding planned
and she got sick
she got really sick
you could smell there was something
wrong inside her like something damp
something from a basement
i didnt stay with her
i didnt look after her i ran away
i make myself go and visit her grave
at first it was once a week
and then maybe it was once a month
and now less
i go there to feel guilty you know
i thought i would feel guilty
for the rest of my life but
actually its starting to fade
and no song was sung
youre an arsehole
i am
no voice was raised
it works
it works
youre making me yours
im an arsehole
so am i
a couple of arseholes
mr and mrs arsehole
no song was sung
so this is the situation
here in bangkok thailand
we call it severe
hearing loss syndrome
and we still do not
know much about it
anger rage hate
and then they go deaf
and how does it spread
i cant hear you very well but do not
know what to do tell me what to do
sound cuts out and distorts
standing there looking at me
sound distortion increases
why are you just looking at me
distorted shouting
you help us now
sounds cuts in and out
help us now
send some help quick
send some help now
i think its ok to panic now
and thats basically
what the world does
severe hearing loss syndrome
spreads from thailand
across india to china
russia and beyond
rage
anger
hatred
and then the loss of another sense
all the unaffected can do is wait
tada
can you still get film for those
yeah i got some from my uncle
camera whirs
he was a collector
what did he collect
polaroid cameras
here
distant screaming
incubation period is dropping all the time
its down from 24 hours to about 11
its very aggressive
mobile rings
yeah
pager bleeps
yeah we stick with the 2006 plan
stephen
ok
its still valid
isolate the first ones
get ready for loads more
theyre saying a child was born
in berlin with all its senses

distant sirens

the council wants to hire you and
your staff to cook for the quarantined

cacophony of street sounds mingling
exhales heavily
both laugh
michael

yeah
mr and mrs arsehole
hmm
we could play
make me special games
we could play at lovers
and we could fuck
but youre just like all the others
dont you think that you matter
cos you dont
youre nothing
you are just passing time
its not difficult to understand
its just fucking
and eating and fat and flour
you go out there you lie down
on your back and spread your legs
or take your profound conversations
and your emotions and fuck off
youre just a pair of ears and a mouth
an arsehole and a cunt
it might surprise you to know this
but everyone else has that too
a pair of ears and an arsehole
fat and fucking flour
nothing special about this one
except that shes infertile
fat and flour fat and flour
fat and fucking flour
fat and fucking flour
clattering and banging
fat and flour
fat fat fucking flour
yells
aargh oh god
woman shouting
women screaming
screaming
man screams
yelling
let me in let me in

soundless

soundless
soundless
soundless
there are two movements now
there are the people who run through
the streets grabbing all they can
people who dont believe in anything
but the end of the world
then theres the other movement
farmers going out to
milk their cows
soldiers reporting for duty
those who believe
that life will go on somehow
or just dont know
what else to do
faint vibrations
faint reverberations
faint thrum of vibrations
people prepare for the worst
but hope for the best
they concentrate on the things
that are important to them
soundless
all the things beyond fat and flour
soundless
once we thought of the ice age
as something that crept up
glaciers slowly spreading
temperatures gradually dropping
but recently a number of intact
mammoths have been discovered
with stomachs full of
undigested grass
the cold must have hit them
like a blow from a club
deep rumbling
thats how the darkness
descends upon the world
but first the shining moments
a shared flinching
of the brains temporal lobe
a profound appreciation
of what it means to be alive
but most of all a shared urge
to reach out to one another
to offer warmth
understanding
acceptance
forgiveness
love
soundless
its dark now
but they feel each others breath
and they know all they need to know
they kiss
and they feel each others tears
on their cheeks
and if there had been
anybody left to see them
then they would look like normal lovers
caressing each others faces
bodies close together
eyes closed
