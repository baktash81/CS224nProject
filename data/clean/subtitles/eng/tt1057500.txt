that mr nelson mandela will be released
at the victor verster prison
on sunday the 11th of february
at about 3 pm
theres mr nelson mandela
mr mandela a free man
taking his first steps
into a new south africa
this is the moment
the world has been waiting for
man 2 and the top news of the day here
in south africa and around the world
the recent release
of nelson mandela from prison
has triggered a power struggle
between the anc and their black rivals
there are reports that the government
has been secretly providing arms
to these groups
contributing to the violence
that has erupted
throughout the country
south africa appears to be
on the verge of a civil war
mr mandela has traveled to durban
in an effort to persuade 100000 angry
young anc supporters on the frontline
to make peace
take your knives and your guns
and your pangas
and throw them into the sea
man 2 after four years of talks
the day black south africans
have been fighting for
has finally arrived
for the first time they are free
to cast their vote alongside whites
an estimated 23 million people
went to the polls today
i nelson rolihlahla mandela
do hereby swear to be faithful
to the republic of south africa
never never and never again shall it be
that this beautiful land will again
experience the oppression
of one by another

of being the skunk of the world

that is your right
and if you feel in your heart that you
cannot work with your new government

he saw it he sees everything
i hate rugby
engage
with you with you here onside
onside
come on now now now
try england
for england scored by ben clarke
number 13
england 11 south africa 0
fuck man
these okes mean business
we need to focus
come okes we need to focus focus
lets go boys
right come on
conversion is good
why dont we do a little work
while we watch
we have a lot of promises to keep
yes we do
well its not too late
if the boys can just pick up their game
if they dont heads will roll
come on you bloody bastards
where do you want to go first
for foreign investment
where the money is
america england saudi arabia
how long before the world cup
about a year
well its time enough for improvement
mr president
dont get your hopes up
were a damn disgrace
england 24 south africa 9
do you see all those old apartheid flags
theyre a disgrace
it is also a constitutional right
along with the apartheid anthem i know
but its time people moved on
look at this
all of the whites are cheering
for the springboks
all of the blacks are cheering
for england
we used to do that on the island
you know
we would cheer for anyone but the boks
it made the warders very angry
of course it did
sorry im late how is it going
number 10
very badly
maybe its just as well
why
ive just been at a meeting
of the national sports executive
theres a strong support to drop the
springbok emblem and colors altogether
if they play badly
maybe its a good time to make a change
this could be the last time
we have to look at the green and gold
fuck man this is bullshit
françois pienaars team came to
loftus versfeld stadium this afternoon
unprepared and arrogant
they left 80 minutes later
with their tails between their legs
like whipped mongrels
and i for one am glad
not because they lost
but because there is now no way
to ignore the fact that we are
completely and utterly unprepared
to reenter the world
of topnotch international rugby
the rugby world cup
is now less than a year away
and i for one am relieved
that we are the host nation
and therefore qualify automatically
for the tournament
somebody gets the ax
because i am not sure
that we would get in on merit alone
whos it gonna be
pienaars team played
without discipline
without strategy and without courage
and therefore
hes trying to get them to drop me
hes just bitter because the springboks
were boycotted when he played
maybe but people listen
to what he says
they brought shame upon our nation
and i for one can say
without fear of contradiction
that today these 15
socalled men did not deserve
to wear the hallowed green and gold
heres your muti madiba
i warmed the milk tonight
you are too good to me mary
your daughter called
to cancel her visit this weekend
did she say why
no she didnt
she said to tell you she was sorry
i see
do you need anything else tonight
no mary thank you i will go to bed
good evening dada
good evening mary
hello there you go
dlaminl god bless you
thank you
cole some nice pants for you
dlaminl god bless you
there you go
there you go
dlaminl god bless you
youre a very lucky boy
its a real springbok practice jersey
i mean i know its a bit big
but its warm and itll last forever
come
go on take it its yours
why wont he take it
if he wears it the others will beat him up
because the springboks
are playing so badly
no because for them
springbok still represents apartheid
and now for the next item on our agenda
the nsc executive proposes a vote
on the following motion
that as a permanent symbol
of the apartheid era
the colors emblem
and the name of the springboks
be eliminated immediately
and that all sports teams
representing south africa
shall be known forthwith
as the proteas
now comrades
we will submit this motion to a hand vote
and in the event of a close count
well go to a written ballot
all of those in favor of eliminating
the springboks raise your hands
viva proteas viva
viva
both units to their cars right now
all right lets go lets do it
what do i tell
the japanese trade delegation
i delegate that decision to you
do you want me to inform the vp
no
we should at least include
the minister of sport
no
i strongly advise against doing this
especially on your own
it gives the impression
of autocratic leadership
you risk alienating your cabinet
and your party
your advice is duly noted
madiba the people want this
they hate the springboks
they dont want to be represented
by a team they cheered against
yes i know but in this instance
the people are wrong
and as their elected leader
it is my job to show them that
youre risking your political capital
youre risking your future as our leader
the day i am afraid to do that
is the day i am no longer fit to lead
at least risk it for something
more important than rugby
tell the boys i want to go
to eersterust very fast
we the executive would like
to applaud you for your diligence
and your courage
please join us in our anthem
comrades comrades
members of the choir
we would only interrupt such beautiful
music for something truly important
please welcome president mandela
thank you
womadiba welcome madiba
thank you mandela
mandela
thank you
i thank you please
smile
brothers
sisters
comrades
i am here because
i believe you have made a decision
with insufficient information
and foresight
i am aware of your earlier vote
i am aware that it was unanimous
nonetheless i believe
we should restore the springboks
restore their name their emblem
and their colors immediately
let me tell you why
on robben island
in pollsmoor prison
all of my jailers were afrikaners
for 27 years
i studied them
i learned their language
read their books
their poetry
i had to know my enemy
before i could prevail against him
and we did prevail did we not
all of us here we prevailed
our enemy is no longer the afrikaner
they are our fellow south africans
our partners in democracy
and they treasure springbok rugby
if we take that away we lose them
we prove that we are
what they feared we would be
we have to be better than that
we have to surprise them
with the compassion
with restraint and generosity
i know all of the things they denied us
but this is no time
to celebrate petty revenge
this is the time to build our nation
using every single brick
available to us
even if that brick comes wrapped
in green and gold
you elected me your leader
let me lead you now
who is with me on this
who is with me
twelve votes twelve
a luxury
we only needed one more yes than no
what if you hadnt got it
well you know
that is the partys decision
im sorry madiba but weve got
problems everywhere we look
housing food jobs crime our currency
you cant keep interrupting
affairs of state to placate a minority
but i must
that minority still controls the police
the army and the economy
if we lose them
we cannot address the other issues
so this rugby
is just a political calculation
it is a human calculation
if we take away what they cherish
the springboks
their national anthem
we just reinforce
the cycle of fear between us
i will do what i must to stop that cycle
or it will destroy us
42 south africa 20
beer tastes like shit man
its not the beer

what did he just say
he asked when we were supposed
to sleep

about our emancipation
and pushed back
the frontier of racism
the millions of our people

and thank you again

i like soccer myself

what they say about soccer

on the other hand rugby is
a hooligans game played by gentlemen
yeah yeah yeah ive heard that one
before it wasnt funny the first time
can i ask you a question lieutenant
yeah of course
whats he like
when i worked for the previous president
it was my job to be invisible
this president well

from his visit in england
to him no ones invisible

office of the president
mr pienaar right this way please
yeah thank you
go on in
françois
what an honor
i am so excited thank you
for coming all this way to see me
yes sir thank you for inviting me
mr president
so tell me françois how is your ankle
my ankle
i was told it was hurt has it healed
the truth is sir you never really play
at 100 percent no matter what
yes in sports as in life
yes sir
please sit
take this one
looking into the light hurts my eyes
mrs brits
you are a shining light in my day
yes sir
mrs brits this is françois pienaar
captain of the springboks
shall i pour sir
no no i would prefer to do it myself
thank you very much mrs brits
how do you like your tea françois
just milk please
the english have given us many things
including rugby
but afternoon tea that is the greatest
there we are
thank you sir
you have a very difficult job
i do
i have a trading business
captain of the springboks
a very difficult job
well not compared to yours
mr president
well no one is trying to tear my head off
while im doing mine
yes sir
tell me françois
what is your philosophy on leadership
how do you inspire your team
to do their best
by example ive always thought
to lead by example sir
well that is right that is exactly right
but how to get them to be better
than they think they can be
that is very difficult i find
inspiration perhaps
how do we inspire ourselves to greatness
when nothing less will do
how do we inspire everyone around us
i sometimes think it is
by using the work of others
on robben island
when things got very bad
i found inspiration in a poem
a poem
a victorian poem
just words
but they helped me to stand
when all i wanted to do was to lie down
but you didnt come all this way
to hear an old man talk
about things that make no sense
no no please mr president
it makes complete sense to me
on the day of a big match say a test
in the bus on the way to the stadium
nobody talks
yes theyre all preparing
right
but when i think were ready
i have the bus driver put on a song
something ive chosen one we all know
and we listen to the words together
and it helps
i remember when i was invited to
the 1992 olympics in barcelona
everybody in the stadium
greeted me with a song
at the time the future
our future seemed very bleak
but to hear that song in the voices
of people from all over our planet
made me proud to be south african
it inspired me to come home
and do better
it allowed me to expect more of myself
may i ask what was the song sir
well it was nkosi sikelel iafrika
a very inspiring song
we need inspiration françois
because in order to build our nation
we must all exceed
our own expectations
so whats he like
hes not like anyone ive ever met before
yeah i hope what did he want
what did he talk about did he talk
about rugby what did he talk about
françois its like talking to
a brick wall what did he say
i think he wants us to win the world cup
excuse me
what do you think
it doesnt matter what i think
yes it does
okay
he looks like one of the policemen
who forced us out of our house
when you were in jail
i dont like seeing you shake his hand
and im not the only one
you criticize without understanding
you seek only to address
your own personal feelings
that is selfish thinking zindzi
it does not serve the nation
zindzi wait please
zindzi l
here
give this to your mother for me please
what is it
its a bracelet i found unpacking
why dont you just throw it away
i dont have the right
doesnt belong to me
if she left it she meant to throw it away
mrs pienaar said you were
finished with the paper
yeah yeah of course
lets go go low yeah thats it good
boy
there we go hit
the world cup is played
every four years
sixteen teams qualify
from around the world
four pools of four teams
each playing in nine different venues
around the country
two teams will advance from each pool
to the quarterfinals
ivory coast qualifies thats wonderful
according to the experts well reach
the quarterfinals and no further
according to the experts
you and i should still be in jail
you make a personal appearance
at the finals
and at the opening match
between australia and the springboks
the finals will be broadcast to over
a billion people around the world live
a billion people watching us
this is a great opportunity
i reckon youve knocked
the stuffing out of them today
and now come on boys
i havent even begun
we may not be the most talented team
in the world
but were sure as hell
going to be the fittest
lets go again guys
come on boys nut up
shit
brenda yes sir
please get the head
of south african rugby for me
right away
thank you
yep one more
guys listen up
dr luyt just wants a few words please
afternoon men
good to see you all working so hard
i have a short announcement
as part of the pr buildup
to the world cup
you will be conducting coaching clinics
in townships all over the country
i know i know
you have plenty on your plates already
but this is a request from the top
the very top
thank you
this is complete crap man
what is this
what are we some sort of circus act now
we dont have time for shit like this
they expect us to play our best
to give our bloody all
then they add to our bloody workload
what do you think about this chester
well i try not to think
because it interferes with my rugby
you see now theres a rugby player
talk to them cappie
make them understand
we dont have time for this
yeah
yeah
im not going to talk to them
why not
okes
weve become more
than just a rugby team
and we might as well get used to it
is this you speaking or mandela yeah
exactly
you know me better than that
you know times change
and we need to change as well
shit
yeah glad i dont live here
around there
dont forget
weve got cameras on us at all times
what a bloody joke
chester chester chester
chester i reckon youre up
what am i supposed to do
what you do best
let rip
who wants to play rugby
who here knows the rules of rugby
me
what is it
you hit another player
when the ref is not looking
no no no the first rule of rugby
is you can only pass the ball backwards
or sideways all right shall we practice
yes
all right form a line
lets go boys
ready okay pass
keep your hands up
yeah
like this like this pass it here
im here and im running like this
im there
now now now you run
there you go
and then catch it like that
so i want you in groups of three okay
all right one two three
bokke
yes
bokke
yes yes yes
and in addition
to the nationwide pr campaign
we propose that all retail outlets
charge a nominal fee for plastic bags
we believe that this will generate
excuse me
mr minister if you will forgive me
this all sounds excellent
and we will return to it but if you
will indulge me for just one moment
well soccer is usually
their favorite sport here
but things changed today when a group of
local kids really took to the springboks
in a surprise visit
where françois pienaar
you see that that picture
is worth any number of speeches
this is part of president mandelas
one team one country campaign
this is johan de villiers
reporting live from cape town airport
where the springbok flight
has just landed
thank you
de villiers the green and gold
have just one week
to put the finishing touches
to their grueling training program
and i for one must admit
to being cautiously optimistic
i say cautiously
because in my humble opinion
this springbok team
has been overpracticed on the field
and overcommitted off it
which makes beating a powerhouse
australian side in next weeks cup opener
a tall order especially as this is
an inexperienced team
with a history of coming up short
in big matches
this is johan de villiers
live in cape town
returning you to the studio
in johannesburg
thanks johan for the update
around the world objectively
what are they saying
about our chances to beat australia
everyone thinks theyll beat us
and if they do
well have to go through england and
the all blacks just to get to the final
so it is very important
that we beat australia
thank you
madiba the cabinet ministers are here
to brief you on the trip to taiwan
yes ill be right out
thank you sir
one week boys
we want snipers on top of the stadium
and the surrounding buildings here
no problem
we want those two approaches
completely sanitized
two approaches
were not gonna decide which way
he comes in until the very last moment
we want uniforms plainclothes
sharpshooters
and sniffer dogs
if you need more men we have an
army unit for you on standby at silvermine
were not going to
take chances gentlemen
the president is going to be exposed
much too exposed
brenda
i have been studying
for the summit in taiwan good
no not exactly
test me
they look like thugs
block out their names
see if i can recognize them
andré joubert gavin johnson
did i get them right
yes madiba
thats the way i used to study
in law school
unfortunately chester is far too easy
to identify
but that will change it must
team meeting after dinner
françois
good luck springboks
all right gather around
pass them around
whats this homework
yeah yeah a little
make sure everyones got one
what is this
right we need to learn this song
we cant just mouth the words anymore
nobody cares as long as
were winning the matches
youre wrong they do care
its their bloody song not ours
flipping terrorist song man
they used to arrest you for singing it

have you always been a rugby fan
people dont realize
that i played rugby myself
when i was a student at fort hare
it is a very rough game
almost as rough as politics
how do you think the springboks
will do
i think they will do very well
their level of commitment is tremendous
now its been said
that you used to support any team
that played against the springboks
yes well
obviously that is no longer true
i am 100 percent behind our boys
after all if i cannot change
when circumstances demand it
how can i expect others to

lord can you believe this
now the number on the door 46664
means he was the 466th prisoner
to be interned here in 1964
weve done it up just the way it was
come with me
out of the night that covers me
black as the pit from pole to pole
i thank whatever gods may be
for my unconquerable soul
in the fell clutch of circumstance
i have not winced nor cried aloud
under the bludgeonings of fate
my head is bloody but unbowed
beyond this place of wrath and tears
looms but the horror of the shade
and yet the menace of the years
finds and shall find me unafraid
it matters not how strait the gate
how charged with punishment the scroll
i am the master of my fate
i am the captain of my soul
over there
dada madiba
sir
what happened
its simple exhaustion but it will lead
to worse if its not treated
he needs a complete rest
and i dont mean just simply shifting
the affairs of the state to his bedroom
no phone calls no visitors
no meetings no politics
you know him he wont do that
then im going to put him in isolation
not yet ill threaten him with hospital
if he doesnt behave
ill cancel everything

brilliant
look at the power of that man
there he goes two
cheers mate
beautiful try
his all black teammates come
to congratulate the big fella yet again
lomu is becoming
one of the most intimidating
why dont we do a little work
while were here
just enjoy the rugby
world cup semifinal against england
good clearance from the base
of the scrum
so let me understand this
the all blacks are killing a team
that trashed us last year
thanks for reminding me
yes
and he is
were gonna really have to tackle
a lot better than the english
yeah for sure
we do
for sure yeah
that is lomus second try this afternoon
this guy really likes scoring tries
against the english
are those the judicial appointments
for the free states
theyll keep until after the match
theres the kick
i am the president you know
and the conversion is good
are you watching this guy
hes about your size but
how much does this lomu guy weigh
about 120 kilos
shit its the same as me
yeah but youre slow
lomu looks for contact
every time he gets the ball
yep
thats good for us
yep
i will break my arm my leg my neck
but i will not let that freaking guy go
me too cappie me too
with you cappie with you
all the way
a lot of pushing in the lineup over there
players jostling for position
try to spin it when you pass it yeah
like this
yesno
touch
you must fly in there
still think im wasting my time
with the rugby
hes in the clear and he will go
brenda
please tell the minister of sport
i would like a full report
on the all blacks
this rugby
its still strictly political
yes yes of course
and over the try line as well
sweetheart
hello
hello nerine
françois
dont lose them wont be able to get more
thanks françois
me mum nerine
wait theres a fourth
whos that for
the all blacks beat ireland 43 to 19
i see
they beat wales 34 to 9
i see
they beat japan 145 to 17
a hundred and fortyfive points
in one match
its a new international record
they beat scotland 48 to 30
in the quarterfinals
you saw the match with england
yes
fortyfive to 29
and it was not that close
they seem unstoppable
if the opposing team played them
straight up jonah lomu runs wild
if they focus on lomu
that leaves others free
and also
theres the business of the haka
a maori war dance
yes it is very powerful
my sources tell me that
half of the all black matches
are won before the first whistle
because of it
how can we beat them
i have the coachs number
maybe you could call him and ask
no no i dont want to distract
their focus even for one minute
but how can we win
maybe we wont theyre favored 2to1
madiba we have already exceeded
all expectations on and off the field
its not enough not now not so close
this country is hungry for greatness
brought one of your mums
protein shakes
thinking about tomorrow
no
tomorrows taken care of
one way or another
i was thinking about how you
spend 30 years in a tiny cell
and come out ready to forgive
the people who put you there
come on man
theres nothing more you can do today
have i ever mentioned to you
that i hate rugby
once or twice yes
i just wanna get him through
tomorrow safely thats all
we all do
the tickets sold out long before
the team became popular
theres not exactly going to be
the rainbow nation out there
and thats the reality
now all it takes is one idiot
trying to make a statement
or one fool who thinks that he hears god
speaking to him through the radio
it has happened before but not today
not on our watch and not today
flag face 5 rand flag face
bugger off
its all right
we are at ellis park on
this historic day
where even this early
crowd expectation is at fever pitch
because their beloved
green and gold
has somehow managed
to defy all expectations
but now they come up against a team
unlike any they have placed before
these all blacks are possibly one
of the greatest international sides ever
with a player in jonah lomu
who is as dominant as any
this correspondent has ever seen
madiba
madiba madiba
madiba
bokke bokke bokke
final approach captain
let it be noted that
im taking control of the aircraft
duly noted
i take full responsibility
for what happens from now on
do you see that jet to the east
they get clearance for this
not from us
where is he
vip box
lets get him out of there now
no time
what the hell was that
bokke

of south africa mr nelson mandela

im a little afraid of you

nelson nelson nelson
dr mandela just lifting his cap
to the 62000 people
eunice
wonderful aerial shot
of ellis park stadium
a very emotional moment for both teams
ladies and gentlemen
the national anthem of south africa
south african national anthems
what an unbelievable spectacular here
in johannesburg
the match will now begin
all right
perhaps we should make a little wager
all your gold for all our sheep
well i was thinking
more along the lines of a case of wine
the celebrations over
were now down to the big game
and we await the haka of new zealand
well thats the challenge thats laid down
by the maoris before going into battle
outside outside
new zealand with the best
attacking side of the tournament
this first 20 minutes
will be absolutely critical
south africa has the weight advantage
in the scrums
but i dont think many people have
seen a weak new zealand scrum
put it out
south africa had it in the maul
and they shouldve played it
good interplay by new zealand
now heres a chance for them
engage
break
come boys
what the heck are we doing
lomu is culling us
forwards we must start scrumming
we must disrupt him at the first phase
cant allow lomu to get the ball in space
hes freaking killing us
but listen if lomu gets the ball
whoevers there
james joost
hit the fucking guy
hold onto him hold him
help will come help will be there
we can see that new zealand
were looking to try
and stretch the game to the left to jonah
lomu and give him some time and space
most of the opportunities
have gone new zealands way
now now now
penalty carrying the ball
thats the mark
captain posts
kick is good
number 10 andrew mehrtens
first blood to new zealand
great allaround fly half
is andrew mehrtens
born here in south africa in durban
and now stransky gets a kick thats every bit
as important as the one that mehrtens
the kick is good
number 10 joel stransky
new zealand to restart
penalty carrying the ball
posts
such an important kick for new zealand
the penalty kick is converted
andrew mehrtens for new zealand
the score now
new zealand 6 south africa 3
its a great kick from mehrtens
thirteen minutes gone
theyre at 6 points to 3
new zealand leads south africa
release the ball come on
about 21 minutes gone
both teams up on it 6 points each
boks kick a goal for the lead
for the first time in the match
last feet
stay stay
successful attempt for new zealand
wide wide
unsuccessful kick the score remains 99
thats the closing score 9 points all
and now there will be
a fiveminute break
this is the first final in the history of the
world cup where were having extra time
extra time
so what does this mean
extra time twenty minutes
i dont think i can take it
itll be a test of great character
in these last 20 minutes of this match
whos the fittest team on this field
outside outside
crouch engage
break
penalty
new zealand 12 south africa 9
a great kick from andrew mehrtens
well he certainly had length in reserve
because it was high high
above the crossbar
penalty against green
time off
five minutes sir
françois
too many guys off their feet at the rucks
okay
speak to your team
ill talk to them speak to them
yes
switch to jonah lomu
big mans been quiet in this match
and thats credit to south africas
heads up
look in my eyes
do you hear
listen to your country
seven minutes
seven minutes
defense defense defense
this is it
this is our destiny
come bokke come
yeah
come on
how long before the end
seven minutes
seven minutes
new zealand leads by 12 points to 9
this will be the longest seven minutes
that those 15
spin spin
yes yes bokke
stransky this time has got this kick
of immense importance for his country
yeah
five minutes in extra playing time
now now
and that is the way
one can get a big man coming
joost
and squeeze
joost
has he got it
with minutes remaining
south africa takes the lead 15 to 12
yes
fifteen points to 12
south africa
ellis on the outside
great play here by marc ellis
in reading the game but he cant take
south africa will have go into the scrum
drive

yes
yeah

chester will you lead us in a prayer
thanks lord

thanks for no serious injuries
and most of all
thanks for the win amen

good job
françois a few words
great game
but you couldnt have done it
without the amazing support
of 63000 south africans here today

of 60000 south africans
we had the support
of 43 million south africans
i want to thank you
