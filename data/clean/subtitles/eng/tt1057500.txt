mandela  mandela 
mandela  mandela  mandela 
who is it  sir 
it is that terrorist  mandela 
they let him out 
remember this day  boys 
this is the day our country
went to the dogs 
come  let s go  come 
i am now in a position to announce
that mr  nelson mandela will be released   
   at the victor verster prison   
   on sunday  the 11th of february 
at about 3 p m 
there s mr  nelson mandela 
mr  mandela  a free man   
   taking his first steps
into a new south africa 
this is the moment
the world has been waiting for 
man 2  and the top news of the day here
in south africa and around the world 
the recent release
of nelson mandela from prison   
   has triggered a power struggle
between the anc and their black rivals 
there are reports that the government
has been secretly providing arms   
   to these groups 
contributing to the violence   
   that has erupted
throughout the country 
south africa appears to be
on the verge of a civil war 
mr  mandela has traveled to durban   
   in an effort to persuade 100 000 angry
young anc supporters on the frontline   
   to make peace 
take your knives and your guns
and your pangas   
   and throw them into the sea 
man 2  after four years of talks 
the day black south africans   
   have been fighting for
has finally arrived 
for the first time  they are free
to cast their vote alongside whites 
an estimated 23 million people
went to the polls today 
i  nelson rolihlahla mandela   
   do hereby swear to be faithful
to the republic of south africa 
never  never and never again shall it be   
   that this beautiful land will again   
   experience the oppression
of one by another   
   and suffer the indignity
of being the skunk of the world

but can he run a country

it s a legitimate question 
today marks the beginning
of a new era in south africa   
   as president mandela takes office
in pretoria 
facing issues that range from
economic stagnation and unemployment   
   to rising crime 
while at the same time   
   balancing black aspirations

that is your right 
and if you feel in your heart that you
cannot work with your new government   
   then it is better that you do leave

because you fear   
   that your language
or the color of your skin

disqualifies you from working here

  ask my ulcers 
  good thing it was just a cup 
and good thing he never saw it 
he saw it  he sees everything 
i hate rugby 
engage 
with you  with you  here  onside 
onside 
come on  now  now  now 
try  england 
for england  scored by ben clarke 
number 13 
england  11  south africa  0 
fuck  man 
these okes mean business 
we need to focus 
come  okes  we need to focus  focus 
let s go  boys 
  right  come on 
conversion is good 
why don t we do a little work
while we watch 
  we have a lot of promises to keep 
  yes  we do 
well  it s not too late 
if the boys can just pick up their game 
if they don t  heads will roll 
come on  you bloody bastards 
where do you want to go first
for foreign investment 
where the money is 
america  england  saudi arabia 
how long before the world cup 
about a year 
well  it s time enough for improvement 
mr  president 
don t get your hopes up 
we re a damn disgrace 
england  24  south africa  9 
do you see all those old apartheid flags 
they re a disgrace 
it is also a constitutional right 
along with the apartheid anthem  i know 
but it s time people moved on 
look at this 
all of the whites are cheering
for the springboks 
all of the blacks are cheering
for england 
we used to do that on the island 
you know 
we would cheer for anyone but the boks 
it made the warders very angry 
of course it did 
  sorry i m late  how is it going 
number 10 
very badly 
maybe it s just as well 
why 
i ve just been at a meeting
of the national sports executive 
there s a strong support to drop the
springbok emblem and colors altogether 
if they play badly 
maybe it s a good time to make a change 
this could be the last time
we have to look at the green and gold 
fuck  man  this is bullshit 
françois pienaar s team came to
loftus versfeld stadium this afternoon   
   unprepared and arrogant 
they left 80 minutes later   
   with their tails between their legs
like whipped mongrels 
and i  for one  am glad 
not because they lost 
but because there is now no way   
   to ignore the fact that we are
completely and utterly unprepared   
   to reenter the world
of topnotch international rugby 
the rugby world cup
is now less than a year away 
and i  for one  am relieved
that we are the host nation   
   and therefore qualify automatically
for the tournament 
  somebody gets the ax 
  because i am not sure   
   that we would get in on merit alone 
  who s it gonna be 
pienaar s team played
without discipline   
   without strategy and without courage 
  and therefore   
  he s trying to get them to drop me 
he s just bitter because the springboks
were boycotted when he played 
maybe  but people listen
to what he says 
they brought shame upon our nation 
and i  for one  can say
without fear of contradiction   
   that today  these 15   
   so called men did not deserve
to wear the hallowed green and gold 
here s your muti  madiba 
i warmed the milk tonight 
you are too good to me  mary 
your daughter called
to cancel her visit this weekend 
did she say why 
no  she didn t 
she said to tell you she was sorry 
i see 
do you need anything else tonight 
no  mary  thank you  i will go to bed 
good evening  dada 
good evening  mary 
  hello  there you go 
dlaminl  god bless you 
thank you 
cole  some nice pants for you 
dlaminl  god bless you 
there you go 
there you go 
dlaminl  god bless you 
you re a very lucky boy 
it s a real springbok practice jersey 
i mean  i know it s a bit big 
but it s warm and it ll last forever 
come 
go on  take it  it s yours 
  why won t he take it 
  if he wears it  the others will beat him up 
because the springboks
are playing so badly 
no  because for them
springbok still represents apartheid 
and now for the next item on our agenda 
the nsc executive proposes a vote
on the following motion 
that  as a permanent symbol
of the apartheid era   
   the colors  emblem   
   and the name of the springboks 
be eliminated immediately 
and that all sports teams
representing south africa   
   shall be known forthwith   
   as the proteas 
now  comrades 
we will submit this motion to a hand vote 
and in the event of a close count 
we ll go to a written ballot 
all of those in favor of eliminating
the springboks  raise your hands 
  viva  proteas  viva 
  viva 
both units to their cars right now 
all right  let s go  let s do it 
what do i tell
the japanese trade delegation 
i delegate that decision to you 
  do you want me to inform the vp 
  no 
we should at least include
the minister of sport 
no 
i strongly advise against doing this 
especially on your own 
it gives the impression
of autocratic leadership 
you risk alienating your cabinet
and your party 
your advice is duly noted 
madiba  the people want this 
they hate the springboks 
they don t want to be represented
by a team they cheered against 
yes  i know  but in this instance 
the people are wrong 
and as their elected leader 
it is my job to show them that 
you re risking your political capital 
you re risking your future as our leader 
the day i am afraid to do that
is the day i am no longer fit to lead 
at least risk it for something
more important than rugby 
tell the boys i want to go
to eersterust  very fast 
we  the executive  would like
to applaud you for your diligence   
   and your courage 
please join us in our anthem 
comrades  comrades 
members of the choir 
we would only interrupt such beautiful
music for something truly important 
please  welcome president mandela 
thank you 
womadiba  welcome  madiba 
thank you  mandela 
  mandela 
  thank you 
i thank you  please 
smile 
brothers   
   sisters   
   comrades 
i am here because
i believe you have made a decision   
   with insufficient information
and foresight 
i am aware of your earlier vote 
i am aware that it was unanimous 
nonetheless  i believe
we should restore the springboks 
restore their name  their emblem   
   and their colors immediately 
let me tell you why 
on robben island   
   in pollsmoor prison 
all of my jailers were afrikaners 
for 27 years   
   i studied them 
i learned their language 
read their books   
   their poetry 
i had to know my enemy   
   before i could prevail against him 
and we did prevail  did we not 
all of us here  we prevailed 
our enemy is no longer the afrikaner 
they are our fellow south africans   
   our partners in democracy 
and they treasure springbok rugby 
if we take that away  we lose them 
we prove that we are
what they feared we would be 
we have to be better than that 
we have to surprise them   
   with the compassion   
   with restraint and generosity 
i know all of the things they denied us 
but this is no time
to celebrate petty revenge 
this is the time to build our nation   
   using every single brick
available to us 
even if that brick comes wrapped
in green and gold 
you elected me your leader 
let me lead you now 
who is with me on this 
who is with me 
twelve votes  twelve 
a luxury 
we only needed one more yes than no 
what if you hadn t got it 
well  you know 
that is the party s decision 
i m sorry  madiba  but we ve got
problems everywhere we look 
housing  food  jobs  crime  our currency 
you can t keep interrupting
affairs of state to placate a minority 
but i must 
that minority still controls the police 
the army and the economy 
if we lose them 
we cannot address the other issues 
so this rugby
is just a political calculation 
it is a human calculation 
if we take away what they cherish   
   the springboks 
their national anthem   
   we just reinforce
the cycle of fear between us 
i will do what i must to stop that cycle 
or it will destroy us 
42  south africa  20 
beer tastes like shit  man 
it s not the beer 
take another 
everybody  take one 
pass them around 
right  i d like to propose a toast 
to the taste of defeat 
drink it 
remember this  and promise yourself
never to taste it again 
you re right  it tastes like shit 
okay  here s the schedule
for the overseas trip 
let me see 
what did he just say 
he asked when we were supposed
to sleep 
  as well as other basic human functions 
jason  hey 
if madiba can do it  we can do it 
in a common struggle   
   that has brought
about our emancipation   
   and pushed back
the frontier of racism   
   the millions of our people
say thank you   
   and thank you again 
i come here with a message 
people of the united states of america   
   open your markets to us
and come invest in our country 
and in japan  president mandela
met with japanese officials   
   as he concluded a grueling trip
to the far east 
and in related news  it was announced
that president mandela   
   will visit south africa this week 
stop it  old man

when i worked for the previous president

office of the president 
mr  pienaar  right this way  please 
yeah  thank you 
go on in 
françois 
what an honor 
i am so excited  thank you
for coming all this way to see me 
yes  sir  thank you for inviting me 
mr  president 
so  tell me  françois  how is your ankle 
  my ankle 
  i was told it was hurt  has it healed 
the truth is  sir  you never really play
at 100 percent  no matter what 
yes  in sports as in life 
  yes  sir 
  please  sit 
take this one 
looking into the light hurts my eyes 
mrs  brits 
you are a shining light in my day 
yes  sir 
mrs  brits  this is françois pienaar 
captain of the springboks 
shall i pour  sir 
no  no  i would prefer to do it myself 
thank you very much  mrs  brits 
how do you like your tea  françois 
just milk  please 
the english have given us many things   
   including rugby 
but afternoon tea  that is the greatest 
there we are 
thank you  sir 
you have a very difficult job 
i do 
i have a trading business 
captain of the springboks 
a very difficult job 
well  not compared to yours 
mr  president 
well  no one is trying to tear my head off
while i m doing mine 
yes  sir 
tell me  françois   
   what is your philosophy on leadership 
how do you inspire your team
to do their best 
by example  i ve always thought
to lead by example  sir 
well  that is right  that is exactly right 
but how to get them to be better
than they think they can be 
that is very difficult  i find 
inspiration  perhaps 
how do we inspire ourselves to greatness 
when nothing less will do 
how do we inspire everyone around us 
i sometimes think it is
by using the work of others 
on robben island   
   when things got very bad   
   i found inspiration in a poem 
  a poem 
  a victorian poem 
just words 
but they helped me to stand
when all i wanted to do was to lie down 
but you didn t come all this way
to hear an old man talk   
   about things that make no sense 
no  no  please  mr  president 
it makes complete sense to me 
on the day of a big match  say  a test   
   in the bus on the way to the stadium 
nobody talks 
  yes  they re all preparing 
  right 
but when i think we re ready 
i have the bus driver put on a song 
something i ve chosen  one we all know 
and we listen to the words together 
and it helps 
i remember when i was invited to
the 1992 olympics in barcelona 
everybody in the stadium
greeted me with a song 
at the time  the future   
   our future  seemed very bleak 
but to hear that song in the voices
of people from all over our planet   
   made me proud to be south african 
it inspired me to come home
and do better 
it allowed me to expect more of myself 
may i ask  what was the song  sir 
well  it was  nkosi sikelel  iafrika  
a very inspiring song 
we need inspiration  françois 
because in order to build our nation   
   we must all exceed
our own expectations 
so  what s he like 
he s not like anyone i ve ever met before 
yeah  i hope  what did he want 
what did he talk about  did he talk
about rugby  what did he talk about 
françois  it s like talking to
a brick wall  what did he say 
i think he wants us to win the world cup 
excuse me 
what do you think 
  it doesn t matter what i think 
  yes  it does 
okay 
he looks like one of the policemen   
   who forced us out of our house
when you were in jail 
i don t like seeing you shake his hand

i know  i know 
you have plenty on your plates already 
but this is a request from the top 
the very top 
thank you 
this is complete crap  man 
what is this 
what are we  some sort of circus act now 
we don t have time for shit like this 
they expect us to play our best   
   to give our bloody all 
then they add to our bloody workload 
what do you think about this  chester 
well  i try not to think
because it interferes with my rugby 
you see  now  there s a rugby player 
talk to them  cappie 
make them understand 
we don t have time for this 
yeah 
  yeah 
  i m not going to talk to them 
why not 
okes   
   we ve become more
than just a rugby team   
   and we might as well get used to it 
  is this you speaking or mandela  yeah 
exactly 
you know me better than that 
you know  times change 
and we need to change as well 
shit 
yeah  glad i don t live here 
around there 
don t forget 
we ve got cameras on us at all times 
what a bloody joke 
chester  chester  chester 
chester  i reckon you re up 
  what am i supposed to do 
  what you do best 
let rip 
who wants to play rugby 
who here knows the rules of rugby 
  me 
  what is it 
you hit another player
when the ref is not looking 
no  no  no  the first rule of rugby   
   is you can only pass the ball backwards
or sideways  all right  shall we practice 
  yes 
  all right  form a line 
let s go  boys 
ready  okay  pass 
keep your hands up 
yeah 
like this  like this  pass it here 
i m here and i m running like this 
i m there 
now    now    now you run 
there you go 
and then catch it like that 
so i want you in groups of three  okay 
all right  one  two  three 
  bokke 
  yes 
  bokke 
  yes  yes  yes 
and in addition
to the nationwide pr campaign   
   we propose that all retail outlets
charge a nominal fee for plastic bags 
  we believe that this will generate   
  excuse me 
mr  minister  if you will forgive me 
this all sounds excellent   
   and we will return to it  but if you
will indulge me for just one moment 
well  soccer is usually
their favorite sport here   
   but things changed today when a group of
local kids really took to the springboks   
   in a surprise visit
where françois pienaar   
you see that  that picture
is worth any number of speeches 
this is part of president mandela s
 one team  one country  campaign 
this is johan de villiers
reporting live from cape town airport   
   where the springbok flight
has just landed 
  thank you 
de villiers  the green and gold   
   have just one week   
   to put the finishing touches
to their grueling training program 
and i  for one  must admit
to being cautiously optimistic 
i say  cautiously 
because in my humble opinion   
   this springbok team
has been over practiced on the field   
   and overcommitted off it   
   which makes beating a powerhouse
australian side in next week s cup opener   
   a tall order  especially as this is
an inexperienced team   
   with a history of coming up short
in big matches 
this is johan de villiers 
live in cape town   
   returning you to the studio
in johannesburg 
thanks  johan  for the update   
  around the world  objectively   
   what are they saying
about our chances to beat australia 
everyone thinks they ll beat us 
and if they do   
   we ll have to go through england and
the all blacks just to get to the final 
so it is very important
that we beat australia 
thank you 
madiba  the cabinet ministers are here
to brief you on the trip to taiwan 
yes  i ll be right out 
thank you  sir 
one week  boys 
we want snipers on top of the stadium
and the surrounding buildings here 
no problem 
we want those two approaches
completely sanitized 
two approaches 
we re not gonna decide which way
he comes in until the very last moment 
we want uniforms  plain clothes 
sharpshooters 
and sniffer dogs 
if you need more men  we have an
army unit for you on standby at silvermine 
we re not going to
take chances  gentlemen 
the president is going to be exposed 
much too exposed 
brenda   
   i have been studying 
for the summit in taiwan  good 
no  not exactly 
test me 
they look like thugs 
block out their names 
see if i can recognize them 
andré joubert  gavin johnson 
did i get them right 
yes  madiba 
that s the way i used to study
in law school 
unfortunately  chester is far too easy
to identify 
but that will change  it must 
team meeting after dinner 
françois 
good luck  springboks 
all right  gather around 
  pass them around 
  what s this  homework 
yeah  yeah  a little 
make sure everyone s got one 
what is this 
right  we need to learn this song 
we can t just mouth the words anymore 
nobody cares as long as
we re winning the matches 
you re wrong  they do care 
it s their bloody song  not ours 
  flipping terrorist song  man 
  they used to arrest you for singing it 
right  and now it s one of our anthems 
i can t even read it
or pronounce the words 
all right  okes  it s optional 
take it if you want to 
it means  god bless africa  
which  you have to admit  we could use 
tell us  mr  president 
have you always been a rugby fan 
people don t realize
that i played rugby myself   
   when i was a student at fort hare 
it is a very rough game 
almost as rough as politics 
how do you think the springboks
will do 
i think they will do very well 
their level of commitment is tremendous 
now  it s been said
that you used to support any team   
   that played against the springboks 
yes  well 
obviously that is no longer true 
i am 100 percent behind our boys 
after all  if i cannot change
when circumstances demand it   
   how can i expect others to 
  françois 
  welcome  mr  president 
gentlemen 
forgive me for interrupting your work
the day before such an important match 
but i just wanted to come
and wish you good luck in person 
sometimes  very seldom  as president 
i am allowed to do what i want 
  mr  president  this is   
  i know who this is

  well  then  what do you say now 
  well  that was fantastic 
you must be very happy 
any man would be happy dancing
with a beautiful lady like you 
  mr  president  you re exaggerating 
  not at all 
my father was xhosa 
so he was a polygamist 
as you know  i am not 
but when i look at you  i envy my father 
here s to joel  he s so blue
he s a drunkard through and through
he s a bastard  so they say
he tried to go to heaven
but he went the other way
say one  two  three  four  hey

  hi  nooks

  a change of pace  come 
  you sneaky bugger 
here you go  come on  guys  come 
they used to smuggle gravel
in from the yard   
   throw it across the floor 
they could hear the wardens coming 
wow 
  can we see the president s cell 
  yes  yes  of course 
lord  can you believe this 
now  the number on the door  46664   
   means he was the 466th prisoner
to be interned here in 1964 
we ve done it up just the way it was 
come with me 
out of the night that covers me
black as the pit from pole to pole
i thank whatever gods may be
for my unconquerable soul 
in the fell clutch of circumstance
i have not winced nor cried aloud 
under the bludgeonings of fate
my head is bloody  but unbowed 
beyond this place of wrath and tears
looms but the horror of the shade
and yet the menace of the years
finds  and shall find  me unafraid 
it matters not how strait the gate
how charged with punishment the scroll
i am the master of my fate 
i am the captain of my soul 
over there 
dada  madiba 
sir 
what happened 
it s simple exhaustion  but it will lead
to worse if it s not treated 
he needs a complete rest 
and i don t mean just simply shifting
the affairs of the state to his bedroom 
no phone calls  no visitors 
no meetings  no politics 
you know him  he won t do that 
  then i m going to put him in isolation 
  not yet  i ll threaten him with hospital   
   if he doesn t behave 
  i ll cancel everything 
and i ll come back tonight
to make sure he s not working 
don t cancel the trip to taiwan  not yet 
chester s back

we apologize for the rain delay 
the semifinal match between south africa
and france will begin as soon as possible 
  this is it  let s go  let s go 
expect it to grow faster
than other sectors in the next few years 
manufacturing accounts for 40   
to promote
our international business alliances 
strong industries have developed
in shipping and computers 
  our information   
  please  excuse me 
yes  mr  president  of course 
gentlemen  let us continue
in 10 minutes 
this is good  very good 
so who is our next opponent 
the all blacks play england tomorrow 
then we ll know 
i see 
well  you will make sure that
my schedule is free for the entire match 
yes  dada 
this is good  this is very good 
brilliant 
look at the power of that man 
there he goes  two 
  cheers  mate 
  beautiful try 
his all black teammates come
to congratulate the big fella yet again 
lomu is becoming
one of the most intimidating   
why don t we do a little work
while we re here 
just enjoy the rugby 
  world cup semifinal against england 
good clearance from the base
of the scrum 
so let me understand this 
the all blacks are killing a team
that trashed us last year 
  thanks for reminding me 
  yes 
  and he is   
  we re gonna really have to tackle   
   a lot better than the english 
  yeah  for sure 
  we do 
  for sure  yeah 
that is lomu s second try this afternoon 
this guy really likes scoring tries
against the english   
are those the judicial appointments
for the free states 
they ll keep until after the match 
there s the kick 
i am the president  you know 
and the conversion is good 
are you watching this guy 
he s about your size  but   
  how much does this lomu guy weigh 
about 120 kilos 
shit  it s the same as me 
yeah  but you re slow 
lomu looks for contact
every time he gets the ball 
  yep 
  that s good for us 
yep 
i will break my arm  my leg  my neck 
but i will not let that freaking guy go 
me too  cappie  me too 
  with you  cappie  with you 
  all the way 
a lot of pushing in the lineup over there 
players jostling for position 
try to spin it when you pass it  yeah 
like this 
yes no 
touch 
you must fly in there 
still think i m wasting my time
with the rugby 
  he s in the clear and he will go   
brenda 
please tell the minister of sport   
   i would like a full report
on the all blacks 
this rugby 
it s still strictly political 
yes  yes  of course 
  and over the try line as well 
  sweetheart 
  hello 
  hello  nerine 
  françois 
  don t lose them  won t be able to get more 
  thanks  françois 
me  mum  nerine 
wait  there s a fourth 
who s that for 
the all blacks beat ireland 43 to 19 
  i see 
  they beat wales 34 to 9 
  i see 
  they beat japan 145 to 17 
a hundred and forty five points 
in one match 
it s a new international record 
they beat scotland 48 to 30
in the quarterfinals 
  you saw the match with england 
  yes 
forty five to 29 
and it was not that close 
they seem unstoppable 
if the opposing team played them
straight up  jonah lomu runs wild 
if they focus on lomu 
that leaves others free 
and also 
there s the business of the haka 
a maori war dance 
yes  it is very powerful 
my sources tell me that
half of the all black matches   
   are won before the first whistle
because of it 
how can we beat them 
i have the coach s number 
maybe you could call him and ask 
no  no  i don t want to distract
their focus  even for one minute 
but how can we win 
maybe we won t  they re favored 2 to 1 
madiba  we have already exceeded
all expectations  on and off the field 
it s not enough  not now  not so close 
this country is hungry for greatness 
brought one of your mum s
protein shakes 
thinking about tomorrow 
no 
tomorrow s taken care of 
one way or another 
i was thinking about how you
spend 30 years in a tiny cell   
   and come out ready to forgive
the people who put you there 
come on  man 
there s nothing more you can do today 
have i ever mentioned to you
that i hate rugby 
once or twice  yes 
i just wanna get him through
tomorrow safely  that s all 
we all do 
the tickets sold out long before
the team became popular 
there s not exactly going to be
the rainbow nation out there 
and that s the reality 
now  all it takes is one idiot
trying to make a statement   
   or one fool who thinks that he hears god
speaking to him through the radio 
it has happened before  but not today 
not on our watch and not today 
  flag face  5 rand  flag face 
  bugger off 
it s all right 
we are at ellis park on
this historic day   
   where even this early 
crowd expectation is at fever pitch   
   because their beloved
green and gold   
   has somehow managed
to defy all expectations 
but now  they come up against a team
unlike any they have placed before 
these all blacks are possibly one
of the greatest international sides ever   
   with a player in jonah lomu   
   who is as dominant as any
this correspondent has ever seen 
madiba 
madiba  madiba 
madiba 
bokke  bokke  bokke 
final approach  captain 
let it be noted that
i m taking control of the aircraft 
duly noted 
i take full responsibility
for what happens from now on 
do you see that jet to the east 
they get clearance for this 
  not from us 
where is he 
vip box 
let s get him out of there now 
no time 
what the hell was that 
  bokke 
  yes 
come on 
welcome to ellis park  johannesburg   
   and the 1995 rugby world cup final 
please welcome
the south african springboks 
bokke  bokke  bokke 
and the new zealand all blacks 
all blacks  all blacks  all blacks 
ladies and gentlemen  please welcome   
   the president of the republic
of south africa  mr  nelson mandela 
dr  nelson mandela 
the president of south africa   
   in the rugby jersey
with a number 6 on its back 
the all blacks won t like that

  mr  president

chester 
i want you to know that
your whole country is supporting you 
  good luck 
  thank you  sir 
good luck  son 
what dramatic moments here
at ellis park 
i don t think i ve ever seen
so many flags in one stadium 
  hi 
  our captain 
an honor  sir 
  mr  president 
  good luck 
  jonah 
  good afternoon  sir 
  nice to see you 
  thank you 
i m a little afraid of you 
and that s big jonah lomuv
a big day for him 
  you all be careful now 
  yeah 
good luck 
nelson  nelson  nelson 
dr  mandela just lifting his cap
to the 62 000 people   
eunice 
wonderful aerial shot
of ellis park stadium 
a very emotional moment for both teams 
ladies and gentlemen 
the national anthem of south africa 
south african national anthems 
what an unbelievable spectacular here
in johannesburg 
the match will now begin 
all right 
perhaps we should make a little wager 
all your gold for all our sheep 
well  i was thinking
more along the lines of a case of wine 
the celebration s over 
we re now down to the big game
and we await the haka of new zealand 
well  that s the challenge that s laid down
by the maoris before going into battle 
outside  outside 
new zealand with the best
attacking side of the tournament 
this first 20 minutes
will be absolutely critical 
south africa has the weight advantage
in the scrums   
   but i don t think many people have
seen a weak new zealand scrum 
put it out 
south africa had it in the maul
and they should ve played it 
good interplay by new zealand 
now  here s a chance for them 
engage 
break 
come  boys 
what the heck are we doing 
lomu is culling us 
forwards  we must start scrumming 
we must disrupt him at the first phase 
can t allow lomu to get the ball in space 
he s freaking killing us 
but listen  if lomu gets the ball 
whoever s there   
   james  joost   
   hit the fucking guy 
hold onto him  hold him 
help will come  help will be there 
we can see that new zealand
were looking to try   
   and stretch the game to the left to jonah
lomu  and give him some time and space 
most of the opportunities
have gone new zealand s way 
now  now  now 
penalty  carrying the ball 
that s the mark 
captain  posts 
kick is good 
number 10  andrew mehrtens 
first blood to new zealand 
great all around fly half
is andrew mehrtens   
   born here in south africa in durban 
and now stransky gets a kick that s every bit
as important as the one that mehrtens   
the kick is good 
number 10  joel stransky 
new zealand to restart 
penalty  carrying the ball 
posts 
such an important kick for new zealand 
the penalty kick is converted 
andrew mehrtens for new zealand 
the score now 
new zealand  6  south africa  3 
it s a great kick from mehrtens 
thirteen minutes gone 
they re at 6 points to 3 
new zealand leads south africa 
release the ball  come on 
about 21 minutes gone 
both teams  up on it  6 points each 
boks kick a goal for the lead
for the first time in the match 
last feet 
stay  stay 
successful attempt for new zealand 
wide  wide 
unsuccessful kick  the score remains 9 9 
that s the closing score  9 points all 
and now there will be
a five minute break 
this is the first final in the history of the
world cup where we re having extra time 
extra time 
so  what does this mean 
extra time  twenty minutes 
i don t think i can take it 
it ll be a test of great character
in these last 20 minutes of this match 
who s the fittest team on this field 
outside  outside 
crouch  engage 
break 
penalty 
new zealand  12  south africa  9 
a great kick from andrew mehrtens 
well  he certainly had length in reserve   
   because it was high  high
above the crossbar   
penalty against green 
time off 
  five minutes  sir 
  françois 
too many guys off their feet at the rucks 
  okay 
  speak to your team 
  i ll talk to them  speak to them 
  yes 
switch to jonah lomu 
big man s been quiet in this match
and that s credit to south africa s   
heads up 
look in my eyes 
do you hear 
listen to your country 
seven minutes 
seven minutes 
defense  defense  defense 
this is it 
this is our destiny 
  come  bokke  come 
  yeah 
come on 
how long before the end 
  seven minutes 
  seven minutes 
new zealand leads by 12 points to 9 
this will be the longest seven minutes
that those 15   
spin  spin 
yes  yes  bokke 
stransky  this time  has got this kick
of immense importance for his country 
yeah 
five minutes in extra playing time 
now  now 
and that is the way
one can get a big man coming   
joost 
and squeeze 
joost 
has he got it 
with minutes remaining 
south africa takes the lead  15 to 12 
yes 
fifteen points to 12 
south africa 
ellis on the outside 
great play here by marc ellis
in reading the game  but he can t take   
south africa will have go into the scrum   
drive 
they ve won 
  yes 
  yeah 
yes 
chester  will you lead us in a prayer 
thanks  lord 
for getting us into this final 
thanks for no serious injuries 
and most of all 
thanks for the win  amen 
amen 
good game 
marvelous  marvelous 
good job 
françois  a few words 
great game 
but you couldn t have done it
without the amazing support   
   of 63 000 south africans here today 
yeah  we didn t have the support
of 60 000 south africans 
we had the support
of 43 million south africans 
i want to thank you
for what you have done for our country
