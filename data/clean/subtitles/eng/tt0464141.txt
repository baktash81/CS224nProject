home 
for special children 
that s not why you came 
you ll need a lot of people
for that 
it s not that kind of a home 
we ll be happy
with five or six children 
more would be
too complicated  right 
what about simón 
yes  yes  of course 
i received his file yesterday   
and thought 
 i should visit them
 in case they need anything  
 thunder 
will you make many changes
in the house 
sorry  but i don t understand
why you re here 
 bells chiming 
this information is old 
i know  but i received it all

 door slams

we wanted you to be a bit older

if you want to ask us
anything

listen  simón   
you heard mommy and that lady
talking   
saw the envelope
and invented the game   
because you were afraid
to ask about it 
what if i don t take them 
nothing would happen 
if i don t take them 
how soon would i die 
it would take many days 
many weeks  even  right 
don t worry  we ll take care of

pilar is a psychologist 
she works with the police 
they re working hard
to find simón 
i have a few questions 
your husband told me
about the adoption   
and your son s illness 
as he was adopted   
there are possibilities
we must consider 
what possibilities 
he could have been kidnapped
by a relative 
i heard you recently found   
a woman intruder on the grounds 
benigna escobedo  a social
worker  came a few days ago 
we can t find a social worker
with that name 
could you describe her 
mm   
she was about 70 
with white hair   
pale eyes  very thick glasses 
don t worry  we will find her

woman on radio 
simón sánchez s parents   
carlos  thank you 
  feel more and more forsaken 
the seven year old boy
disappeared from his home
six months ago 
the situation
is even more desperate   
because simón is ill and needs
daily medication  his parents   
laura  my son disappeared
six months ago 
his name is simón 
there are posters everywhere 
you may have seen them 
we ve tried everything   
but not one clue   
not even a trace 
my son had imaginary friends 
we never paid much attention   
but i have the feeling
they re in the house 
woman  i saw my daughter 
a year after her death 
it was at night  we were asleep 
i woke up   
and without knowing why 
i went to her room 
and there she was 
smiling  calm 
i think that was her way
of telling me   
 i m fine  i m safe 
 don t suffer for me  
it is not unusual to feel 
in some way   
the presence of a loved one
after their death 
all of us
in this bereavement group
could tell you similar stories 
you don t understand 
my son is not dead 
his friends took him 
i saw one of them
the same day he vanished 
he was at home 
i ll do whatever it takes
to recover my son 
i m not crazy   
believe me 
i know what i m saying 
woman on radio     cities
on state of alert
due to gales  rain and snow 
the heaviest snowfalls
will be recorded in the north 
man on radio  north of asturias 
tonight  in some cities   
20 cm of snow are expected
in the cantabrian mountains

pilar  we went to benigna s
house  we found some pictures   
and old super 8 films 
i d like you to see them 
are any of the faces familiar 
antonia  the principal 
and these are the orphans 
my friends 
this is martín 
she liked to be called martín 
rita 
víctor   
i think his name was guillermo 
that s alicia  she was blind 
and this is me 
benigna 
the woman that went
to your house   
worked at the orphanage 
laura  that s impossible 
i d remember 
pilar  she wasn t there
very long 
she had a son  tomás 
it seems that the child
was born deformed   
he was kept away
from the others 
no one knew about him 
it was a total shock
for the village
when they found the body 
what do you mean 
it seems he disappeared
while playing 
child s body found on beach
shortly after your adoption 
one of the orphans
later confessed   
that they had played
a trick on him 
they went into the caves
with tomás   
and took his mask off
to see if he d come out 
but he never emerged 
he drowned 
they found his body at low tide 
the children weren t blamed 
they were only playing 
that boy was in my house 
we asked everyone
at the opening party 
no one remembers a child
with a sack over his head 
 ticking 
   plays single note 
 sobbing 
 plays note 
 ticking 
 distant squeaking 
 distant creaking 
 creaking 
 sighs 
i can t remember what it s like
to sleep through the night 
i can t stop thinking 
remember what we called simón
when we met him 
 two little kilos  
you used to say 
 my two little extra kilos  
that s all he weighed 
the doctors said
it wasn t enough 
but it was plenty for us 
although we knew that   
there was little chance
he could ever be normal 
but when we saw him   
saw his smile
for the first time   
his eyes  his bright eyes   
simón made us strong  carlos 
together  we re strong 
together 
forgive me if i get upset 
but it s hard 
carlos 
someone s in the bathroom 
 creaking 
carlos  what is it 
someone was here 
carlos  don t give me that look 
feel  it s still warm 
sure  i just got up 
someone got into the bed 
i m convinced 
 clock ticking 
man  that s what jung
means when he says   
it s in the subconscious that
the living coexist
with the dead 
the germans have another name
for  the herald of death  
doppelganger 
a being that appears
in one s own image 
a double 
to glance at him   
or at any of the others
i ve shown you   
means  without
the slightest doubt   
a passport to the other world 
how long has your son
been missing 
nine months 
strange things are happening 
things linked
to his disappearance 
i don t know who to turn to 
it s not that simple 
you won t find an exorcist
in the yellow pages 
i tore it from my son s
kidnapper s clothes 
the police say he s been dead
for over 30 years 
someone has my son 
i don t know why  but
i won t sit at home and wait 
um   
there s someone in this field 
someone i trust 
i m talking from the heart 
would you allow a medium
to visit your home 
this wasn t a children s room
in the orphanage  right 
no  the bedroom was back there 
then we should start here 
enrique

aurora  i was
in this house  but   
everything was different 
the beds  the toys  the décor 
everything was much older 
the light from the lighthouse
came through the windows 
are you sure
you didn t see simón 
it was too dark  i m sorry 
i couldn t recognize anyone 
but the children were there 
you saw the children 
is that right 
that s right 
you re talking about ghosts 
man  and what is a ghost 
carlos 
there s something here 
and we all saw it 
when something terrible
happens   
sometimes it leaves a trace   
a wound that acts   
as a knot between
two time lines 
it s like an echo   
repeated over and over 
waiting to be heard 
like a scar   
oh  i m sorry 
like a scar or a pinch   
that begs for
a caress to relieve it 
laura   
we who are close to death   
we are more receptive
to these messages 
hmm 
you mean my son
could see those children   
because   
well  laura   
i think that s enough 
please take your things
and leave 
carlos  we can t let them
go like this 
pilar  laura  this is a farce   
a sideshow trick 
i can t believe this  why 
for what reason 
they re right  aren t they 
they don t want money 
not yet 
laura  what should i do 
tell me  what should i do 
it s been a long time 
and the police still
haven t found a single clue   
not a single clue   
as to where my son can be 
whether dead or alive 
what do i do  just sit and wait 
can it hurt to listen 
laura  stop 
no  you stop 
tell me  pilar   
how many similar cases have you
had in this damned village 
get another distraction 
i didn t invite you here 
 engine starts 
what should i do 
my dear   
you are a good mother 
your pain gives you strength 
it will guide you 
but only you know
how far you are willing to go   
to find your son 
i don t know what to do 
you hear  but don t listen 
seeing is not believing 
it s the other way around 
believe   
and you will see 
the search for simón continues
what are you doing 
we can t stay here any longer 
we should go 
at least for a while 
the children are here 
aurora saw them  i can t leave 
you heard the voices 
enrique was upstairs
for one hour 
playing around with the cables 
can t you see
it could be a set up 
that s pilar s theory  a set up 
her rational theory 
pilar is protecting us 
from what 
things like this evening 
people entering our home and
fucking up our lives even more 
they just want to help 
help 
didn t you hear them 
did they mention finding simón 
no  they just want
to contact the dead  laura 
if simón s alive  i can t see
how they can help us 
if he s not 
they won t recover him 
i m neither willing nor able
to keep taking this shit 
please  laura 
let s leave this house 
carlos  you can t ask me to give
up  neither you nor pilar 
laura  we can survive this 
many couples lose a child
and pull through
