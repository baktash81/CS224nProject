theyre working hard
to find simón
i have a few questions
your husband told me
about the adoption
and your sons illness
as he was adopted
there are possibilities
we must consider
what possibilities
he could have been kidnapped
by a relative
i heard you recently found
a woman intruder on the grounds
benigna escobedo a social
worker came a few days ago
we cant find a social worker
with that name
could you describe her

simón sánchezs parents
carlos thank you
feel more and more forsaken
the sevenyearold boy
disappeared from his home
six months ago
the situation
is even more desperate
because simón is ill and needs
daily medication his parents
laura my son disappeared
six months ago
his name is simón
there are posters everywhere
you may have seen them
weve tried everything
but not one clue
not even a trace
my son had imaginary friends
we never paid much attention
but i have the feeling
theyre in the house
woman i saw my daughter
a year after her death
it was at night we were asleep
i woke up
and without knowing why
i went to her room
and there she was
smiling calm
i think that was her way
of telling me
im fine im safe
dont suffer for me
it is not unusual to feel
in some way
the presence of a loved one
after their death
all of us
in this bereavement group
could tell you similar stories
you dont understand
my son is not dead
his friends took him
i saw one of them
the same day he vanished
he was at home
ill do whatever it takes
to recover my son
im not crazy
believe me
i know what im saying
woman on radio cities
on state of alert
due to gales rain and snow
the heaviest snowfalls
will be recorded in the north
man on radio north of asturias
tonight in some cities
20 cm of snow are expected
in the cantabrian mountains
region
cities that usually end up
isolated during
these storms and

pilar we went to benignas
house we found some pictures
and old super8 films
id like you to see them

antonia the principal
and these are the orphans
my friends
this is martín
she liked to be called martín
rita
víctor
i think his name was guillermo
thats alicia she was blind
and this is me
benigna
the woman that went
to your house
worked at the orphanage
laura thats impossible
id remember
pilar she wasnt there
very long
she had a son tomás
it seems that the child
was born deformed
he was kept away
from the others
no one knew about him
it was a total shock
for the village
when they found the body
what do you mean
it seems he disappeared
while playing
childs body found on beach
shortly after your adoption
one of the orphans
later confessed
that they had played
a trick on him
they went into the caves
with tomás
and took his mask off
to see if hed come out
but he never emerged
he drowned
they found his body at low tide
the children werent blamed
they were only playing
that boy was in my house
we asked everyone
at the opening party
no one remembers a child
with a sack over his head
ticking
plays single note
sobbing
plays note
ticking
distant squeaking
distant creaking
creaking
sighs
i cant remember what its like
to sleep through the night
i cant stop thinking
remember what we called simón
when we met him
two little kilos
you used to say
my two little extra kilos
thats all he weighed
the doctors said
it wasnt enough
but it was plenty for us
although we knew that
there was little chance
he could ever be normal
but when we saw him
saw his smile
for the first time
his eyes his bright eyes
simón made us strong carlos
together were strong
together
forgive me if i get upset
but its hard
carlos
someones in the bathroom
creaking
carlos what is it
someone was here
carlos dont give me that look
feel its still warm
sure i just got up
someone got into the bed
im convinced
clock ticking
man thats what jung
means when he says
its in the subconscious that
the living coexist
with the dead
the germans have another name
for the herald of death
doppelganger
a being that appears
in ones own image
a double
to glance at him
or at any of the others
ive shown you
means without
the slightest doubt
a passport to the other world
how long has your son
been missing
nine months
strange things are happening
things linked
to his disappearance
i dont know who to turn to
its not that simple
you wont find an exorcist
in the yellow pages
i tore it from my sons
kidnappers clothes
the police say hes been dead
for over 30 years
someone has my son
i dont know why but
i wont sit at home and wait
um
theres someone in this field
someone i trust
im talking from the heart
would you allow a medium
to visit your home
this wasnt a childrens room
in the orphanage right
no the bedroom was back there
then we should start here
enrique

aurora i was

the light from the lighthouse
came through the windows
are you sure
you didnt see simón
it was too dark im sorry
i couldnt recognize anyone
but the children were there
you saw the children
is that right
thats right
youre talking about ghosts
man and what is a ghost
carlos
theres something here
and we all saw it
when something terrible
happens
sometimes it leaves a trace
a wound that acts
as a knot between
two time lines
its like an echo
repeated over and over
waiting to be heard
like a scar
oh im sorry
like a scar or a pinch
that begs for
a caress to relieve it
laura
we who are close to death
we are more receptive
to these messages
hmm
you mean my son
could see those children
because
well laura
i think thats enough
please take your things
and leave
carlos we cant let them
go like this
pilar laura this is a farce
a sideshow trick
i cant believe this why
for what reason
theyre right arent they
they dont want money
not yet
laura what should i do
tell me what should i do
its been a long time
and the police still
havent found a single clue
not a single clue
as to where my son can be
whether dead or alive
what do i do just sit and wait
can it hurt to listen
laura stop
no you stop
tell me pilar
how many similar cases have you
had in this damned village
get another distraction
i didnt invite you here
engine starts
what should i do
my dear
you are a good mother
your pain gives you strength
it will guide you
but only you know
how far you are willing to go
to find your son
i dont know what to do
you hear but dont listen
seeing is not believing
its the other way around
believe
and you will see
the search for simón continues
what are you doing
we cant stay here any longer
we should go
at least for a while
the children are here
aurora saw them i cant leave
you heard the voices
enrique was upstairs
for one hour
playing around with the cables
cant you see
it could be a setup
thats pilars theory a setup
her rational theory
pilar is protecting us
from what
things like this evening
people entering our home and
fucking up our lives even more
they just want to help
help
didnt you hear them
did they mention finding simón
no they just want
to contact the dead laura
if simóns alive i cant see
how they can help us
if hes not
they wont recover him
im neither willing nor able
to keep taking this shit
please laura
lets leave this house
carlos you cant ask me to give
up neither you nor pilar
laura we can survive this
