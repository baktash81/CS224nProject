he was heavyfooted as they say
so i stared at the back of this geezers head

i was drilling my eyes into the back of his head
until im not even thinking it anymore

interesting
when my future brother in law interesting said

it meant he had no idea what he or you or anyone else was talking about
fascinating ron
fascinating
ron had been sentenced to three years in prison for grievous bodily harm
near the end of his sentence he was certified insane
and remanded to a mental hospital
what was wanting was a friendly psychiatrist
roger when you say you want me to raspberry this man
im not sure of your vernacular what do you mean
raspberry ripple cripple you want to cripple someone
yup
thats right why is that
because doctor im afraid he may not be inclined
to provide a favorable evaluation to my employer
and who is your employer
ronnie kray
is there hope doctor
excuse me a moment
take your time
ronald kray possesses possibly the soundest mind
ive seen in 26 years in psychiatric practice
in my view to keep him here would be a waste of public resources
a lifetimes integrity down the toilet
the queen would survive
but god save the rest of us
mr kray

charlie richardson was sentenced to 25 years for fraud extortion and assault
london was an open city
and the krays moved in
glad you could come mr de faye
mr payne
im not often intrigued
but your message
it intrigued mmmm
sit down
these are the kray twins
ronald and reginald
flicks lighter
yes ive uh  heard of them
youll find them useful friends
what is this about mr payne
this is about a gambling casino in knightsbridge called esmeraldas barn
im not familiar with it
really
well youll be shocked to learn that you earned 24000
pounds from it in the last three months
my friends and i would like to purchase it from you
we have the contract ready for your signature
ruling london involved intelligence and intimidation
its not for sale
chuckles you might find that in the future there is a less polite approach
the trick was to cultivate a quiet certainty that should it be needed violence was on offer
yeah  and would be happily applied
leslie payne was a fronter and a fixer
reggie found payne useful
but ron was suspicious of him
afraid his scams were the opposite of what a gangster should be
consider las vegas
right
it is all legal and all run by the mafia
soon london will be the same
what with havana gone the mafia is moving in
meyer lansky has already made inquiries
meyer lansky
yeah
as in the meyer lansky
meyer lansky
what the americans gonna try muscling us
nah they dont work that way
they dont want a war ron
theyre businessmen
well maybe i want a war anyway
now look what they do want is to know who is the up and coming local firm
cos they will colonize london by
financing that firm and franchising the city
so you have to prove to the americans that the krays are the only gang in town
yeah very fucking interesting
the world could be our oyster
payne
what
you say our a lot right
you say our and you also so we a lot
do i
my question is  is your last name kray
snorts listen ron you keep the pearls
im perfectly happy with the soft bits
yeah i bet you are i bet you are
reggie i say its a very bad idea this its a bad idea
i say right that we meet these mafioso scum at london in a pub right
we pick them up we chop them up we put them in their fucking luggage and send em straight home away
thats the plan
well im glad we could have this meeting
mr lansky has taken an interest in the colony sporting club
he has his casino people there right now
well mr lansky might want to know that we happen to have a casino of our own
really your own casino
well you see we own las vegas
but here the atlantic ocean is in our way
so mr lansky lacks the ability to uh ensure the physical security of his property
from both outside muscle  and the cops
he thinks the kray family can help
london is going to be the las vegas of europe
we need someone to front and someone to muscle for us
i mean yknow we can do your security
thats not a problem yknow but we dont wanna work for ya
wed much rather that we work with ya
what reggies trying to say
i think he knows what hes trying to say he just said it
were in your backyard yeah
mr lansky is open to discussions of this nature
he sends this as goodwill gesture just a taste for expenses open it please
now the second briefcase contains business of my own
i need to take care of please
bearer bonds free money
a hundred grand in negotiable bearer bonds jacked from a bank in montreal
too hot to move in north america
its a hundred grand
could you guys handle that
yeah we can handle it
really good
boys who jacked it get 20
we split the rest 6040
if this works out reggie
i got a two million dollar backlog of those scharols

i said i prefer boys
italians actually
sometimes greek but im not prejudiced no because
i happened to have a negro once
and a tahitian who i bent up like a pretzel i really fucking hurt him
laughs youve got a lot of fucking balls to admit that kid you know what youve got some set of fucking gestantes on you
you know what i say to that bravo a salute cmon salute right am i right fellas
what fucking balls salute
cheers mate cheers
well done
cheers
you dont understand
hes not what you think he is
he is really sweet
and it is exciting to be with him
just because you have a boring life doesnt mean i have to
if i have a boring life its
because i gave up my life for you
oh frankie you take my breath away
you can have mine
youre a joker go on get in the car
hurry up
esmeraldas barn made money like a dream two thousand pounds a week pure profit
there was nothing to do but enjoy it
owning that casino meant everything to reggie
hed finally crossed the line
between the old east end and the green pastures of the golden west
he was becoming a celebrity himself
as long as their health didnt suffer
the high rollers loved rubbing elbows with gangsters
aristocrats and criminals
have a lot in common
theyre both selfish get
bored easily
and have access to wads of cash they didnt have to work honestly to get
the topper neither have any interest in bourgeois rules or morality
put it all together with a roulette wheel  a stunning recipe for success
ron was the odd man out
his pills stabilized him
but theyd never cure him
club land held little charm
and he yearned for reggie
and the dark side of gangland
as soon as you turn your back
life plays dirty tricks on ya yknow
we wouldnt spend christmas together that year
there was an old warrant on reggie
the last six months
on his sentence was on appeal but it was denied

alright
im sorry
alright
it was time for the krays to enter the secret
history of the 1960s
as absurd as it seems
it grew out of rons nutter dream of building a utopian city in nigeria
some are born to be ronnie kray
and some have ronnie kray thrust upon them
lord boothby was a distinguished member of the
house of lords
ronnie
yes
i regret that my answer is no
nigeria is simply too far away
and i never involve myself in a thing i cant control personally
im so sorry
hes really lovely isnt he
i take it you like ice and a slice my lord
ice and a slice
please teddy bear
and dont spare the horses
do you know where i hear
that lemons are particularly lovely and fresh
no where
enugu  nigeria
youre very well informed teddy
very well informed
down the hatch
do you like it down the hatch teddy
boothby declined
but friendship ensued
and the perverted peer was soon a guest
at rons flat
the ripples would spread far and wide
do call me later tom
harry all alone
no need to be there is plenty of fruit on the tree
tom not in the house of commons tonight
yeah
fucking look at me you cunt
yeah
go on fucking look at him now
fucking look at me
look at me
good lord thats bob boothby
yes prime minister sir
at an orgy
chuckles
the tories are going to have trouble explaining this
here sir
is that tom driberg
in fact yes sir
there is no moral advantage to my party
if my party are also involved
it gets a bit stickier sir
where were these photos taken
cazenove road hackney
what in gods boots were they doing in hackney
well thats where it gets sticky
i thought the orgy was the sticky bit  it gets stickier still
weve had two brothers gangsters under surveillance
the krays
the photographs were taken in ronald krays flat
orgies aside were tracking fraud protection rackets
and the american mafia might also be involved
londons bottom had reached her top
scandal loomed
the elections are in ten weeks
theyll vote out both sides of the house
what exactly are you doing about it
bugger all by the looks of it
is that italian
i dont know
is it a daimler
its nice that is
oh what do you want for christmas
umm i dont know you dont have to get me anything ey
you dont have to get me a present
oh that is ridiculous
not get you anything for christmas
alright well you surprise me then
ill give you a sack of coal
ill get you a sockful of coal
lucky thing
well what about that
what about it
for christmas
for me
thats going to be my club
is it
yeah
west end a touch of class
that is our ticket out of here
its snowing
yeah
gone
what did i want for christmas
my reggie free and above board
but ron wanted his reggie back as well
he longed for his gangster twin
and reggie  he chose the hideaway instead
the owner was hugh mccowan the
son of a baronet
though he was not usually intimidated
by the working classes
he agreed to sell half the club
reggie knew hed get the rest in time
a dirty deal for a clean life
ron was terrified of
reggie leaving him behind
he sent mad teddy round to kill the deal
listen gentlemen
ive spoken to reggie
im sorry
i cant look at you darling or im going to get lost in your eyes
ive got a deal with reggie
this is shit
i signed a contract
i have an arrangement with reggie ask him
crap
gentlemen please
please i have customers
out of the way thats it come on
i have customers here gentlemen please
i have spoken to reggie
we dont work for reggie
we work for ronnie
ron almost got what he wanted
mccowan backed out of the deal
but he also called the police
reggie and ron were both charged
with extortion
frannie im tell you the police stitched me up
i am innocent
im
completely innocent even if you are
what
youre back in prison
you made a promise to me
and it still stands
im fucking innocent
sorry i dont mean to swear at you alright
i really want you to marry me
please
if youre innocent and acquitted
ill marry you
if youre guilty i never want to see you again
why do you say that
frankie dont
frankie dont
strangely it was lord boothby
who saved the day
his walk on the wild side
had not gone unnoticed
ive finally found the photo
its been forwarded to the proper places
say enugu
enugu
the photo was taken in boothbys flat ended up with the paper
along with the story of sexual misconduct
between a gangster and the member of the house of lords
the problem is arnold that unfortunately
its all true for once
i dont care about the truth harold
except that the greater the truth
the greater the libel
an election was looming
but the prime minister brought in his fixer arnold goodman
to sort things out
get me cecil king at the sunday mirror
the great and the good engineered a coverup
a cracking good one
when the krays defense threatened to call
boothby as a character witness
the implication was clear
the government would have to drop its case
or face the consequences
it was this that made the krays the untouchables of london crime
new information casts poor light on the prosecution witness
mr mccowan
case dismissed
that night the krays held their celebration party at mccowans club
reggie had bought the hideaway that same afternoon
at a discount
thank you
why are you here then
ive come to see the difference between you and me
the difference yeah
alright
what do you know
i grew up poor
like you
i boxed as a lad like you
but it didnt turn me into a thief
but it did turn you into policing didnt it
yeah
it did turn you into handling your own over at the bar innit
you know the difference between us right
apart from yknow the obvious
is that i right i work for me
and you
you work for them
sir i can explain
this is scotland yard
and this investigation will end at once
but theres so much more we can get them on
your investigation into the krays will end at once
alright alright shes wearing black mate
i know i know shes read it wrong isnt she
she thought it was a fucking funeral
wearing black oh that fucking bitch
i know dont drive yourself mad
waitll you see the daughter
she looks unbelievable in white
what do you see in her
i see meself yeah
i see what i could be
yknow
if i wasnt so scared
youre not afraid of anything
right
well only meself yknow
and you
yeah
what is she doing
you know what shes going to be saying alright
just take it easy deep breaths
why are not you inside dear
are you absolutely sure you want to go through with this
mom please dont start this again
its all right frank
i love him
love
do you even know what love is frances
well i know its not an answer to anything
but love is a witness
reggie sees me
and i see him
and who are you to refuse that
im your mother
ey east end starlet frances
thats you
thank you
oh ron look at her
she looks beautiful
enjoy yourself
gracious god
accept our prayers for frances and reginald
that they may reap the harvest of the spirit
and reflect your glory
through christ jesus our lord
amen
amen
fucking  sing
we honeymooned in greece
the parthenon had stood for two thousand four hundred years
reggies promise to go straight lasted two weeks
two aces
new mill
the gigi club
and lets not forget ronnie scott
and this is the bearer bond cash in hamburg
the kettles on the boil
it is tea
we started out near marble arch in west london
but we both missed the east end
and so we took an empty flat
below rons at cedra court
like all else in life it was supposed to be temporary
not very clever
rons parties would keep me awake at night
and clubland kept reggie out until all hours
he enjoyed being a gangster after all
we heard that you uh were down the regency the other night
waving a shotgun
those bastard barry brothers blocked me from coming in
they said i was drunk
you were
you was drunk as a skunk
waving a shotgun
no
now you know we look after that place
right
we dont want you messing around down there
i spiced the evening up for people yknow
spiced it up
here you go
youre not going to do that anymore are you
no sir
good lad
oh bollocks
go on get up jack fuck
this is so kind of you
sweet isnt it
lovely yeah
oh hello
oh uh
is that ok
no no
no frances that wo  that wont do umm
go and sit with mr kray and ill sort it out
alright
she cant even make a decent cup of tea
yeah poor reggie ey
it was a good effort
she looks like a budgie in that dress doesnt she
you reckon that a man wouldnt pick her up if she was laying in the gutter
yeah oh well
poor reggie right i swear
i shall flush that
i left without saying goodbye
a sad victory
id never be good enough for their reggie
he was nippers reggie as well
reed couldnt rest
unless he clapped eyes on my husband once a day
i often had to settle for the same
wherever youre going
dont stop until you get to the sea
but we all need something
what i shared with ron
was needing pills to get through the day
sleeping pills helped sometimes
other pills helped other times
they were like a friend who held no judgment
and only wanted to be loved
in return
mothers little helpers
they were very well named
dont go too fast
were not going anywhere like too fast
were in the grass
alright almost there
alright

in that one commanding syllable
its the only word
some need to hear
whats that mean the only word
well youre like ford
oh yeah or shell
or woolworths
woolworths
yes thats  uh  thats very interesting
what im saying is kray is a brand
and an established reputation
means less maintenance less violence
yknow people fall actually into line
clubs are asking for our protection
before we even offer it
yeah thats true actually they uh yes
i suppose that would leave us with less straightening out to do
hes right
makes sense
see but i happen to like
i like straightening out yknow once in a while
obliging someone to the old cobbles ey
whats wrong with that
i just think you could do better ron yknow
