 nipper read was the copper on the krays case 
and he made his presence known  
 he was heavy footed  as they say  
 so i stared at the back of this geezer s head 
and the whole time i m thinking     umm  
give ron kray your sausage 
give ron    
your fucking sausage 
y know 
i was drilling my eyes into the back of his head    
until i m not even thinking it anymore  
i m not even thinking 
i m broadcasting it 
until he turns around and you know what he says 
 he says    
 hey  ron  do you fancy my sausage  
i ve got no appetite for it  
interesting 
 when my future brother in law  interesting  said     
  right 
 it meant he had no idea what he  or you or anyone else was talking about  
fascinating  ron 
fascinating 
 ron had been sentenced to three years in prison for grievous bodily harm  
 near the end of his sentence  he was certified insane
 and remanded to a mental hospital  
 what was wanting was a friendly psychiatrist  
roger  when you say you want me to raspberry this man    
i m not sure of your vernacular  what do you mean 
raspberry ripple  cripple   you want to cripple someone 
yup 
 that s right  why is that 
because  doctor  i m afraid he may not be inclined    
to provide a favorable evaluation to my employer 
  and who is your employer 
ronnie kray 
is there hope  doctor 
excuse me a moment 
take your time 
ronald kray possesses possibly the soundest mind 
i ve seen in 26 years in psychiatric practice 
in my view  to keep him here would be a waste of public resources 
a lifetime s integrity down the toilet 
 the queen would survive 
 but god save the rest of us  
mr  kray 
i hope you know what you re doing 
  yeah  i know what i m doing  i m going back to london

paranoid schizophrenic who walks into a bar

 they never stood a chance against my beautiful reggie  
 a gang war seemed certain  
  fucking hell  ron

 charlie richardson was sentenced to 25 years for fraud  extortion and assault  
 london was an open city 
and the krays moved in  
glad you could come  mr  de faye 
mr  payne 
i m not often intrigued  
but your message    
it intrigued   mmmm 
sit down 
these are the kray twins 
ronald and reginald 
   flicks lighter 
yes  i ve  uh     heard of them 
  you ll find them useful friends 
what is this about  mr  payne 
  this is about a gambling casino in knightsbridge called esmeralda s barn 
i m not familiar with it 
  really 
well you ll be shocked to learn that you earned 24 000
 pounds from it in the last three months 
my friends and i would like to purchase it from you 
 we have the contract ready for your signature 
 ruling london involved intelligence and intimidation  
it s not for sale 
 chuckles  you might find that in the future there is a less polite approach 
 the trick was to cultivate a quiet certainty that should it be needed violence was on offer     
yeah       and would be happily applied  
 leslie payne was a fronter and a fixer  
 reggie found payne useful 
 but ron was suspicious of him  
 afraid his scams were the opposite of what a gangster should be  
consider las vegas 
  right 
it is all legal and all run by the mafia 
soon  london will be the same  
what with havana gone  the mafia is moving in 
meyer lansky has already made inquiries 
  meyer lansky 
  yeah 
as in the meyer lansky 
meyer lansky 
what  the americans gonna try muscling us 
  nah  they don t work that way 
they don t want a war  ron 
 they re businessmen 
well  maybe i want a war  anyway 
now look  what they do want is to know who is the up and coming local firm 
cos they will colonize london by 
financing that firm and franchising the city 
so you have to prove to the americans that the krays are the only gang in town 
yeah  very fucking interesting 
the world could be our oyster 
  payne 
  what 
you say  our  a lot  right 
you say  our  and you also so  we  a lot 
do i 
my question is     is your last name kray 
 snorts  listen  ron  you keep the pearls  
i m perfectly happy with the soft bits 
yeah  i bet you are  i bet you are 
reggie  i say it s a very bad idea  this  it s a bad idea 
i say  right  that we meet these mafioso scum at london in a pub  right 
we pick them up  we chop them up  we put them in their fucking luggage and send em straight home away 
that s the plan 
well  i m glad we could have this meeting 
mr  lansky has taken an interest in the colony sporting club 
he has his casino people there right now 
well  mr  lansky might want to know that we happen to have a casino of our own 
really  your own casino 
well  you see  we own las vegas 
but here the atlantic ocean is in our way 
so mr  lansky lacks the ability to  uh  ensure the physical security of his property 
from both outside muscle     and the cops 
he thinks the kray family can help  
london is going to be the las vegas of europe 
we need someone to front and someone to muscle for us 
i mean  y know  we can do your security 
 that s not a problem  y know  but we don t wanna work for ya 
we d much rather that we work with ya 
what reggie s trying to say    
  i think he knows what he s trying to say  he just said it 
we re in your backyard   yeah   
mr  lansky is open to discussions of this nature 
he sends this as goodwill gesture  just a taste  for expenses  open it  please 
now  the second briefcase contains business of my own 
i need to take care of  please 
bearer bonds  free money 
a hundred grand in negotiable bearer bonds jacked from a bank in montreal 
too hot to move in north america 
it s a hundred grand  
could you guys handle that 
yeah  we can handle it 
really  good 
boys who jacked it get 20   
we split the rest 60 40 
if this works out  reggie  
i got a two million dollar backlog of those scharols 
does that sound like you re staying out of our way 
50 50  mate 
i like you  reggie  
50 50 it is  done 
i m glad that we could make a deal   yeah   now this feels right 
listen  uh  you come to philadelphia anytime   
you see what you want  any size  any shape  right  we ll get it for ya 
a nice italian girl  a little spaghetti and meatballs 
i prefer boys 
excuse me  i didn t catch that 
i said i prefer boys 
 italians  actually 
sometimes greek  but i m not prejudiced  no  because 
i happened to have a negro  once 
and a tahitian who i bent up like a pretzel  i really fucking hurt him 
 laughs  you ve got a lot of fucking balls to admit that  kid  you know what  you ve got some set of fucking gestantes on you 
you know what i say to that  bravo a salute  c mon  salute  right  am i right  fellas 
what fucking balls  salute 
  cheers  mate   cheers 
well done 
  cheers 
 you don t understand  
he s not what you think he is  
 he is really sweet 
and it is exciting to be with him  
 just because you have a boring life doesn t mean i have to  
 if i have a boring life  it s 
because i gave up my life for you  
oh  frankie  you take my breath away 
you can have mine 
you re a joker  go on  get in the car 
hurry up 
 esmeralda s barn made money like a dream  two thousand pounds a week pure profit  
 there was nothing to do but enjoy it  
 owning that casino meant everything to reggie  
 he d finally crossed the line 
between the old east end and the green pastures of the golden west  
 he was becoming a celebrity himself  
 as long as their health didn t suffer  
the high rollers loved rubbing elbows with gangsters  
 aristocrats and criminals 
have a lot in common  
 they re both selfish  get 
bored easily     
 and have access to wads of cash they didn t have to work honestly to get  
 the topper  neither have any interest in bourgeois rules or morality  
 put it all together with a roulette wheel     a stunning recipe for success  
 ron was the odd man out  
 his pills stabilized him  
but they d never cure him  
 club land held little charm     
 and he yearned for reggie 
and the dark side of gangland  
as soon as you turn your back    
life plays dirty tricks on ya  y know 
 we wouldn t spend christmas together that year  
 there was an old warrant on reggie  
 the last six months
 on his sentence was on appeal  but it was denied  
 he was to surrender in the morning  
 my real life was about to begin  
see you in a bit 
see ya later  reg 
  so long  reg 
frank

  alright 
i m sorry 
alright 
 it was time for the krays to enter the secret 
history of the 1960 s  
 as absurd as it seems     
 it grew out of ron s nutter dream of building a utopian city in nigeria  
some are born to be ronnie kray    
and some have ronnie kray thrust upon them 
 lord boothby was a distinguished member of the 
house of lords  
ronnie 
  yes 
i regret that my answer is no 
nigeria is simply too far away    
and i never involve myself in a thing i can t control personally 
i m so sorry 
he s really lovely  isn t he 
i take it you like ice and a slice  my lord 
ice and a slice 
please  teddy bear 
and don t spare the horses 
do you know where i hear 
that lemons are particularly lovely and fresh 
no  where 
enugu     nigeria 
you re very well informed  teddy 
very well informed 
down the hatch 
do you like it down the hatch  teddy 
boothby declined  
but friendship ensued 
and the perverted peer was soon a guest
 at ron s flat 
the ripples would spread far and wide 
do call me later  tom 
harry  all alone 
no need to be  there is plenty of fruit on the tree 
tom  not in the house of commons tonight 
yeah 
fucking look at me  you cunt 
yeah 
go on  fucking look at him now 
fucking look at me 
look at me 
good lord  that s bob boothby 
yes  prime minister  sir 
at an orgy 
  chuckles 
the tories are going to have trouble explaining this 
here  sir 
is that tom driberg 
in fact  yes  sir 
there is no moral advantage to my party 
if my party are also involved 
it gets a bit stickier  sir 
where were these photos taken 
cazenove road  hackney 
what in god s boots were they doing in hackney 
  well that s where it gets sticky 
i thought the orgy was the sticky bit     it gets stickier still 
we ve had two brothers  gangsters  under surveillance 
the krays 
the photographs were taken in ronald kray s flat 
orgies aside  we re tracking fraud  protection rackets    
and the american mafia might also be involved 
london s bottom had reached her top 
scandal loomed 
the elections are in ten weeks 
they ll vote out both sides of the house 
what exactly are you doing about it 
bugger all  by the looks of it 
is that italian 
i don t know 
is it a daimler 
it s nice  that is 
oh  what do you want for christmas 
umm  i don t know  you don t have to get me anything   ey   
you don t have to get me a present 
oh  that is ridiculous 
 not get you anything for christmas 
alright  well you surprise me then 
  i ll give you a sack of coal 
i ll get you a sockful of coal 
 lucky thing 
well  what about that 
what about it 
for christmas 
for me 
that s going to be my club 
is it 
  yeah 
west end  a touch of class 
that is our ticket out of here 
it s snowing 
yeah 
gone 
 what did i want for christmas  
 my reggie  free and above board  
 but ron wanted his reggie back as well  
 he longed for his gangster twin  
 and reggie     he chose the hide a way instead  
 the owner was hugh mccowan  the 
son of a baronet  
 though he was not usually intimidated
 by the working classes     
 he agreed to sell half the club  
 reggie knew he d get the rest in time  
 a dirty deal for a clean life  
 ron was terrified of 
reggie leaving him behind  
 he sent mad teddy round to kill the deal  
  listen  gentlemen    
i ve spoken to reggie
  i m sorry    
i can t look at you  darling  or i m going to get lost in your eyes 
i ve got a deal with reggie    
  this is shit 
i signed a contract 
i have an arrangement with reggie  ask him 
crap 
  gentlemen  please 
please  i have customers 
out of the way  that s it  come on 
i have customers here  gentlemen  please 
i have spoken to reggie 
we don t work for reggie 
we work for ronnie 
 ron almost got what he wanted  
 mccowan backed out of the deal 
 but he also called the police  
 reggie and ron were both charged
 with extortion  
frannie  i m tell you  the police stitched me up 
i am innocent 
 i m    
completely innocent   even if you are    
what 
you re back in prison 
you made a promise to me 
and it still stands  
i m fucking innocent 
sorry  i don t mean to swear at you  alright 
i really want you to marry me 
please 
if you re innocent and acquitted  
i ll marry you 
if you re guilty  i never want to see you again 
  why do you say that 
frankie  don t    
frankie  don t 
 strangely  it was lord boothby 
who saved the day  
 his walk on the wild side
 had not gone unnoticed  
i ve finally found the photo 
it s been forwarded to the proper places 
say   enugu  
enugu 
the photo was taken in boothby s flat ended up with the paper 
along with the story of sexual misconduct    
between a gangster and the member of the house of lords 
the problem is arnold  that  unfortunately    
it s all true for once 
i don t care about the truth  harold 
except that  the greater the truth    
the greater the libel 
an election was looming 
but the prime minister brought in his fixer  arnold goodman 
to sort things out 
get me cecil king at the sunday mirror 
the great and the good engineered a cover up 
 a cracking good one 
when the kray s defense threatened to call 
boothby as a character witness    
the implication was clear 
the government would have to drop its case    
or face the consequences 
it was this that made the krays the untouchables of london crime 
new information casts poor light on the prosecution witness
  mr  mccowan 
case dismissed 
that night the kray s held their celebration party at mccowan s club 
reggie had bought the hide away that same afternoon 
at a discount 
thank you 
why are you here  then 
i ve come to see the difference between you and me 
the difference  yeah 
alright 
what do you know 
  i grew up poor    
like you 
i boxed as a lad  like you 
but it didn t turn me into a thief 
but it did turn you into policing  didn t it 
yeah 
it did turn you into handling your own over at the bar  innit 
you know  the difference between us  right    
apart from  y know  the obvious    
is that i  right  i work for me 
and you    
you work for them 
sir  i can explain 
this is scotland yard 
and this investigation will end at once 
but there s so much more we can get them on   
  your investigation into the krays will end at once 
alright  alright   she s wearing black  mate 
i know  i know  she s read it wrong  isn t she 
she thought it was a fucking funeral 
wearing black oh that fucking bitch 
  i know  don t drive yourself mad 
wait ll you see the daughter  
she looks unbelievable in white 
what do you see in her

i see what i could be 
y know 
if i wasn t so scared 
  you re not afraid of anything 
right 
well  only meself  y know 
and you 
  yeah 
what is she doing 
you know what she s going to be saying  alright 
just take it easy  deep breaths 
why are not you inside  dear

mom  please  don t start this again 
  it s all right  frank 
i love him 
love 
do you even know what love is  frances 
well  i know it s not an answer to anything 
but love is a witness 
reggie sees me 
and i see him 
and who are you to refuse that 
i m your mother 
ey  east end starlet  frances 
that s you 
thank you 
oh  ron  look at her 
she looks beautiful 
enjoy yourself 
gracious god    
accept our prayers for frances and reginald    
that they may reap the harvest of the spirit    
and reflect your glory
 through christ jesus our lord 
amen 
  amen
fucking     sing 
 we honeymooned in greece  
 the parthenon had stood for two thousand  four hundred years  
 reggie s promise to go straight lasted two weeks  
two aces    
new mill    
the gigi club    
and let s not forget ronnie scott 
and this is the bearer bond cash in hamburg 
the kettle s on the boil 
it is tea 
we started out near marble arch in west london 
but we both missed the east end 
and so we took an empty flat 
below ron s at cedra court 
like all else in life it was supposed to be temporary 
not very clever 
ron s parties would keep me awake at night 
and clubland kept reggie out until all hours 
he enjoyed being a gangster  after all 
  we heard that you  uh  were down the regency the other night 
waving a shotgun 
those bastard barry brothers blocked me from coming in 
they said i was drunk 
you were  
you was drunk as a skunk 
waving a shotgun 
no 
now you know we look after that place 
right 
we don t want you messing around down there 
i spiced the evening up for people  y know 
spiced it up 
here you go 
you re not going to do that anymore  are you 
no  sir 
good lad 
oh  bollocks 
go on  get up  jack  fuck 
this is so kind of you 
sweet  isn t it

go and sit with mr  kray and i ll sort it out 
alright 
she can t even make a decent cup of tea 
yeah  poor reggie  ey 
it was a good effort 
she looks like a budgie in that dress  doesn t she 
you reckon that a man wouldn t pick her up if she was laying in the gutter 
yeah   oh well 
poor reggie  right  i swear    
i shall flush that 
 i left without saying goodbye  
 a sad victory  
 i d never be good enough for their reggie  
 he was nipper s reggie as well  
 reed couldn t rest
 unless he clapped eyes on my husband once a day  
 i often had to settle for the same  
wherever you re going  
don t stop until you get to the sea 
 but we all need something  
 what i shared with ron
 was needing pills to get through the day  
 sleeping pills helped sometimes 
 other pills helped other times  
 they were like a friend who held no judgment     
 and only wanted to be loved 
in return  
 mother s little helpers  
 they were very well named  
don t go too fast 
we re not going anywhere like too fast  
we re in the grass 
alright  almost there 
alright  
  a bit more    
ok   ok  
you ready 
  yes 
  really ready   yes 
oh my god 
do you like it 
yes  what     what kind is it  
what s it called 
it s uh  it s a triumph  it s a spitfire  triumph spitfire 
  can i get in

 happy birthday  here y are 
happy birthday  frances 
  thank you

i     uh     just can t     not today 
but i can tomorrow 
  alright 
sorry 
kray 
kray 
there s an inherent threat
 in that one commanding syllable 
it s the only word
 some need to hear 
what s that mean  the only word 
well  you re like ford 
oh yeah  or shell 
or woolworth s 
woolworth s  
yes  that s     uh     that s very interesting 
what i m saying is kray is a brand    
and an established reputation
 means less maintenance  less violence 
y know  people fall  actually  into line 
clubs are asking for our protection
 before we even offer it 
yeah  that s true  actually  they  uh  yes  
i suppose that would leave us with less straightening out to do
