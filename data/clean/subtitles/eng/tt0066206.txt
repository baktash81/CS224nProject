 bugle plays 
be seated 
 shuffling 
now  i want you to remember   
   that no bastard ever won a war   
   by dying for his country 
he won it   
   by making the other poor dumb
bastard die for his country 
men   
   all this stuff you ve heard
about america not wanting to fight   
   wanting to stay out of the war   
   is a lot of horse dung 
americans   
   traditionally love to fight 
all real americans love
the sting of battle 
when you were kids   
   you all admired
the champion marble shooter   
   the fastest runner  big league
ball players  the toughest boxers 
americans love a winner   
   and will not tolerate a loser 
americans play to win all the time 
i wouldn t give a hoot in hell
for a man who lost and laughed 
that s why americans have never lost
and will never lose a war   
   because the very thought
of losing   
   is hateful to americans 
now   
   an army is a team 
it lives  eats  sleeps 
fights as a team 
this individuality stuff
is a bunch of crap 
the bilious bastards who wrote
that stuff about individuality   
   for the saturday evening post   
   don t know anything more about real
battle than they do about fornicating 
now we have the finest food
and equipment   
   the best spirit   
   and the best men in the world 
you know   
   by god  i actually pity those poor
bastards we re going up against 
by god  i do 
we re not just going to shoot
the bastards   
   we re going to cut out
their living guts   
   and use them to grease
the treads of our tanks 
we re going to murder those lousy
hun bastards by the bushel 
now   
   some of you boys   
   i know are wondering   
   whether or not you ll chicken out
under fire  don t worry about it 
i can assure you   
   that you will all do your duty 
the nazis   
   are the enemy 
wade into them 
spill their blood 
shoot them in the belly 
when you put your hand   
   into a bunch of goo   
   that a moment before was
your best friend s face   
   you ll know what to do 
there s another thing
i want you to remember 
i don t want to get any messages
saying we are  holding our position   
we re not  holding  anything 
let the hun do that 
we re advancing constantly  we re not
interested in holding on to anything   
   except the enemy 
we re going to hold on to him
by the nose and kick him in the ass 
we re going to kick the hell
out of him all the time   
   and we re going to go through him
like crap through a goose 
now   
   there s one thing   
   that you men will be able to say
when you get back home 
and you may thank god for it 
thirty years from now when you re
sitting around your fireside   
   with your grandson on your knee   
   and he asks you 
 what did you do in the great
world war ii  
you won t have to say 
 well   
   i shovelled shit in louisiana   
all right  now  you sons of bitches   
   you know how i feel 
i will be proud   
   to lead you wonderful guys
into battle anytime   
   anywhere 
that s all 
 jeeps rumbling 
 dog barks 
the arabs need food and clothing 
they strip our dead before
we can even bury them 
looks like the reports were
pretty accurate 
sixty one armored vehicles 
45 tons of ammunition   
   twenty five 40mm guns 
three self propelled 105s 
not counting mortars  machine guns 
rifles   
   pistols  telescopes  belt buckles 
gl socks 
one thousand  eight hundred men 
 cheering 
 speaks in foreign language 
our people salute you  general   
   for your brilliant amphibious
landing on the continent of africa   
   and for your enlightened
administration of our country 
i ve enjoyed being here  excellency 
naturally  i d prefer to be in tunisia
fighting the germans 
 band plays 
 the lions in their dens
tremble at his approach   
i appreciate that  excellency 
 band plays 
magnificent 
i wish our troops looked that good 
tell me  general 
what do you think of morocco 
i love it  excellency 
it s a combination
of the bible and hollywood 
bradley  these men fight at kasserine 
carver  yes  sir 
for the american army to take
a licking like that   
   the first time at bat
against the germans   
up against rommel  what we need
is the best tank man we ve got 
somebody tough enough
to pull this outfit together 
  patton 
  possibly 
god help us 
 siren wails 
 speaking in arabic 
lieutenant   
   where is the duty officer 
sir   
  he said he s caught at shaving 
  why isn t he here on duty 
guess he needed a shave 
we got a new commanding general
due today 
 crashing 
man  who the hell is kicking me
in the butt 
oh  sorry  sir 
  what were you doing down there 
  trying to get some sleep  sir 
well   
get back down there  son 
you re the only son of a bitch here
who knows what he s trying to do 
yes  sir 
patton  brad  how the hell are you 
  fine  george  good to see you 
we were all under the impression
you wouldn t be here until 0900 
yes  i gathered that 
  you know my boy  dick jenson 
  yes 
brad  tell me 
  what are you doing here 
  ike wanted a report on kasserine 
meanwhile  i have to stay here
as an observer   
   but i report directly to ike 
you re spying 
get me general eisenhower s
headquarters 
tell me  brad   
   what happened at kasserine 
i heard it was a shambles 
apparently  everything went wrong 
we d send over a 75mm shell 
the krauts would return an 88 
their tanks are diesels 
even when we managed to hit one
they kept on running  our tanks   
the men call them
 purple heart boxes   
one hot piece of shrapnel
and the gasoline explodes 
i warned them about the tank 
i taiked to one of the
soldiers about the half tracks 
i asked them if the machine gun
bullets pierced the armor 
and he said   no  sir 
they just come through one side
and rattle around a bit   
i understand they had a little trouble
coordinating the air cover 
the trouble was no air cover 
  general smith on the line  sir 
  excuse me  brad 
bedell 
listen  i m calling about bradley
and his job here 
i need a good number two man  i want
to make brad my deputy commander 
you clear it with ike 
all right  thanks  bedell 
now you re not spying for eisenhower
anymore  you re working for me 
  okay 
  fine  okay 
dick  you got those stars 
  yes  sir 
  let s get them on 
what s the matter  brad 
i ve been nominated by the president 
i know  but it doesn t become official
until it s approved by the senate 
well   
   they have their schedule
and i have mine 
george   
   if you were named admiral
of the turkish navy   
   i believe your aides could dip
into their haversacks   
   and come up with the appropriate
badge of rank 
anyway  congratulations 
premature congratulations 
you know   
i think those stars look better
on a green shirt 
did i ever tell you about the time i
designed a uniform for tank crewmen 
it was green leather 
it had red stripes   
   and sort of a row of brass buttons
down across here 
and topped off
by a gold football helmet 
the army rejected it  of course 
goddamn  it was beautiful 
 whistle blows 
lloyd fredendall is just leaving 
george  there s one other thing i put
in my kasserine report 
some of our boys
were just plain scared 
that s understandable 
even the best foxhound is gun shy
the first time out 
i can remember   
   when nothing frightened me
as much as the idea of   
   a bullet coming
straight for my nose 
i don t know why  but the image of a
bullet coming right for my nose   
   was more horrible
than any other possibility 
well  i can understand that 
with such a handsome nose 
you want to know why this outfit
got the hell kicked out of it 
blind man could see it in a minute 
they don t look like soldiers 
they don t act like soldiers 
why should they fight like soldiers 
you re absolutely right 
the discipline s pretty poor 
ln about 15 minutes we re going
to start turning these boys   
   into fanatics  razors 
they ll lose their fear
of the germans 
i hope to god they never lose
their fear of me 
up bright and early  general 
breakfast 
have all my officers
finished breakfast 
we re open from 6 till 8 
most of the officers are
just coming in  sir 
please inform these officers
the mess hall is closed 
but  sir  it s only a quarter to 8 
from now on  you will open at 6
and no one will be admitted after 6  15 
where are your leggings 
leggings  well  hell  general  sir 
i m a cook 
you re a soldier 
 20 fine 
gentlemen   
   from this moment any man   
   without leggings  without a helmet 
without a tie   
any man with unshined shoes
or soiled uniform   
   is going to be skinned 
this is a barracks 
it s not a bordello 
 chattering 
  good morning 
  good morning  sir 
doctor 
sir 
i understand you have two cases
of self inflicted wounds 
yes  sir  we do 
get them out of here 
one has developed a serious infection 
i don t care if he dies 
just get him out of here 
doesn t belong in the same room
with men wounded in battle 
  i ll see that they re moved 
  one more thing 
there ll be no  battle fatigue   
that s an order 
battle fatigue is a free ride
to the hospital 
i m not going to subsidize cowardice 
yes  sir 
doctor   
where s your helmet 
i don t wear a helmet
in the hospital 
start 
i can t use my stethoscope
when i m wearing my helmet 
well   
   then cut two holes in your helmet
so that you can 
and get those yellow bellies
out of here  today 
hold it 
turn right  here 
the battlefield is ahead 
don t argue 
i can smell a battlefield 
he was out here yesterday 
it s over there  turn right  damn it 
it was here 
the battlefield was here 
the carthaginians
defending the city   
   were attacked by three
roman legions 
they were brave  but they
couldn t hold  they were massacred 
arab women   
   stripped them of their tunics
and their swords and lances 
the soldiers lay naked in the sun   
   2000 years ago 
i was here 
you don t believe me 
you know what the poet said 
 through the travail of ages
it s the pomp and toils of war
have i fought and strove and perished
countless times upon the star
as if through a glass and darkly
the age old strife i see
where i fought in many guises
many names
but always me   
you know who the poet was 
me 
there s an opportunity
for us to mount an offensive 
we ve concentrated on the flank   
   draw strength from the british 
it appears now that we could   
   split the african corridor 
drive through rommel to the sea 
i m sorry  but that territory
has been reserved   
   for general bernard law montgomery 
we re supposed to let him win this one
no matter what 
they re entitled to have their hero 
montgomery did push rommel
clear across north africa 
what about the americans 
don t they need a hero too 
you have anybody in mind 
air vice marshal coningham
is here with general buford 
excuse me  gentlemen   
   while i ask our british friends
what s happened to our air cover 
bradley 
harry 
how are you 
george  good to see you 
  you know arthur coningham 
  sir arthur 
delighted to see you 
i ve heard so much about you 
gentlemen  it appears there s been a
slight misunderstanding here   
   and ike thought we should fix it 
no  no  no misunderstanding 
we re supposed to have allied
air cover and we don t 
german planes are strafing my troops 
if i may say so  general  i m afraid
your operation reports are inaccurate 
report  three days ago  the crowds
took off after my command car   
   ran my ass into a ditch 
my staff has assured me 
we have complete air supremacy   
   everywhere in the mediterranean 
patton 
when i complained about air cover   
   you said our troops
were not battleworthy 
you spoke of the discredited practice
of using air force as an alibi   
   for lack of success on the ground 
i have to wet nurse montgomery 
i don t have to stand for that 
i sincerely apologize for that remark 
whoever made it 
and i promise you one thing  general 
you will see no more german planes 
 chicken squawks 
we were discussing air supremacy 
sir arthur 
 horn honks 
 gunfire 
damn door won t open 
by god  that s enough 
get that thing out of here 
come on  you bastards 
take a shot at me on the nose 
get back in here  george  we need
a corps commander  not a casualty 
coningham 
how d you manage to stage that 
i don t know   
   but if i could find
the nazis flying those things   
   i d give them each a medal 
patton  can t get over how cold
it gets in the desert 
awfully cold  sir 
patton  rommel s out there somewhere 
waiting for me 
jenson 
yes  sir 
patton 
you know   
   if i had my way  i d send
that genius son of a bitch   
   an engraved invitation
in iambic pentameter 
a challenge in two stanzas
to meet me alone in the desert 
i ll deliver it 
rommel in his tank and me in mine 
we d stop about 20 paces 
we d get out  we d shake hands   
   then we d button up and do battle 
just the two of us 
that battle would decide
the outcome of the war 
it s too bad jousting s
gone out of style 
it s like your poetry  general 
it isn t part of the 20th century 
you re right  dick 
the world grew up 
hell of a shame 
dick  i want a 24 hour guard
put around this area 
if we don t  the arabs will dig
them up for their clothes 
yes  sir 
our graves aren t gonna disappear
like everybody else s who fought here 
the greeks  romans  carthaginians 
god  how i hate the 20th century 
general 
general 
we intercepted a german radio message 
rommel s 10th panzer is going
to hit us near el guettar 
rommel  huh 
 brays 
all my life   
   i ve wanted to lead a lot of men
in a desperate battle 
now i m going to do it 
look 
battalion strength at least 
they haven t spotted our positions yet 
they ll get an education
in about 10 seconds 
wait till they get a dose of
that artillery fire 
commence firing 
fire at will 
commence firing  fire at will 
commence firing  fire at will 
what a hell of a waste
of fine infantry 
  get general bradley on the radio 
  yes  sir 
sir  i can t raise him 
go tell him to hit them hard  here s
where we hold them by the nose   
   and kick them in the ass 
go on 
put him in my car 
 plane whines 
rommel   
   you magnificent bastard 
i read your book 
patton  captain richard n  jenson
was a fine boy 
loyal  unselfish and efficient 
i am terribly sorry 
there are no coffins here
since there is no wood 
we will have a trumpeter
and an honor guard   
   but we will not fire the volleys as
people would think an air raid was on 
i enclosed a lock of dick s hair
in a letter to his mother 
he was a fine man   
   and a fine officer 
and he had no vices 
i shall miss him a lot 
i can  t see the reason
such fine young men get killed 
there are so many battles
yet to fight 
narrator  battle weary  but
victorious  american gls and tommies   
   of the british 8th army meet in
an allied victory celebration   
   at wadi akarit in north africa 
for the first time in this war 
broadway and piccadillyjoin hands 
meanwhile  general montgomery 
hero of el alamein   
   continues to lead his
victorious british 8th army   
   in a relentless drive against
rommel s vaunted africa corps 
 speaks in german 
general bradley s done
a tremendous job with 2nd corps 
he s moved into bizerte
and taken over 41 000 prisoners 
good  very good 
you re not surprised  are you 
after all  you trained that outfit 
  excuse me  general 
  hm 
this is interesting  we ve discovered
rommel wasn t present at el guettar 
  who says so 
  g2  sir 
when we took 10th panzer 
rommel was in berlin with an earache 
severe nasal diphtheria  sir 
also  hitler probably
retained rommel in berlin   
   because things were going badly
for the africa corps 
he didn t want his favorite general
to lose face 
i m my favorite general 
and i don t like to be told   
   that some second stringer
is up against me  then i lose face 
who the hell are you  anyway 
carver  general  this is lieutenant
colonel codman  your new aide 
codman  i pulled your name off
the list because i know your family 
i m glad you did  sir 
rommel is the best the krauts have 
and i kicked the hell out of him 
now my own g2 section is telling
me he wasn t even there 
but  general  he undoubtedly
planned the german battle 
if you defeat rommel s plan  you ve
defeated rommel  lsn t that true 
codman   
  have a drink with me tonight 
  yes  sir 
i have a plan
for the invasion of sicily 
i want to make sure i get it approved 
you can help me 
i want to give a dinner
for general alexander 
get to him before montgomery does 
this will be strictly a formal affair 
codman  but purely social 
by that i mean   
     purely political 
  yes  sir 
i want the finest food  the best wine
available  everything  comme il faut 
 speaks in french 
 speaking in french 
 speaks in french 
thank you 
george  this is really splendid wine 
thank you  arthur 
thank you 
sir harold  i think it was alcibiades
in the peloponnesian war   
   415 b c 
he said   if syracuse falls  all
sicily falls  and then italy   
he knew that syracuse was the
jugular of the island 
old alcibiades always went
for the throat 
i propose to take sicily
in the same way 
  how s it going 
  the old man has them in his pocket 
patton 
now  according to my plan   
   general montgomery will land here 
i ll hit the beaches here 
take palermo 
monty will drive north on the coast 
i ll come due east   
   take messina and cut off
the german escape route 
yes   
it looks like an interesting plan 
well  gentlemen 
to the conquest of sicily 
alexander 
to the conquest of sicily 
officers 
to sicily 
george  you d have made a great
marshal for napoleon   
   if you d lived in the 18th century 
but i did  sir  i did 
morning  is general smith in 
man  i believe he s in the lavatory 
  thank you 
  ah  there you are  bedell 
  monty 
bedell  i ve been giving a good bit of
thought to the sicily operation 
yes 
i assume we re alone 
georgie patton has already
discussed his plan with alexander 
i realize that   
   but i have an idea that his plan
may lead to an absolute disaster 
oh 
bedell  look 
this is sicily 
now then  according to patton s plan   
   i will attack syracuse here 
and he would attack palermo up here 
now  obviously our forces would be
divided 
and obviously  they
could be chopped up piecemeal 
now then  what i propose  and what
i shall insist on  by the way   
   is this 
 montgomery exhales 
i will land at syracuse as planned 
but the americans 
the americans will land here  at gela 
i will advance north to messina 
the americans protecting my flank 
after all  messina is the key 
it s the reason for invading sicily 
i ll discuss your plan with ike 
i m sure he ll give it
serious consideration 
  amusing  isn t it 
  what 
that the plans for the
invasion of sicily   
   should have been put forward
in an algerian lavatory 
george  i have bad news for you
about your sicily plan 
ike has turned it down 
since the italians will be defending
their native soil for the first time   
   and the german resistance is
stiffening  we shouldn t be divided 
  well  where do my people land then 
  in the gulf of gela 
there s nothing there
but a beach 
yes  but it puts you in a good
position to support montgomery 
where does montgomery land 
he ll land in syracuse and drive north
to catania  possibly even messina 
and you ll be alongside 
protecting his left 
i see 
ln other words  we get the burden again
while good old monty gets the glory 
ike had to consider all points of view 
he made his decision not as an
american  but as an ally 
had it been the other way around 
i assure you  monty would protest 
no   
   i ve been in the army 30 years 
when i get an order  i say   yes  sir   
and i do my best to carry it out 
this is what happens when your
commander stops being an american   
   and starts being an ally 
i don t think i ve made
myself clear  sir 
it s true  montgomery met the
toughest resistance there at catania 
however  if we re 
perfectly clear 
old monty is as stuck
as a bug on flypaper 
but this order from
general alexander   
   directing you to turn over the
vizzini caltagirone road to montgomery 
well  then  old bradley will have to
slug  slug  mind you   
   his way up center of the island over
those tough mountain roads  won t he 
yes  sir 
messina  bell 
messina   
   is the heart of it  if they d
followed my plan  i d be there by now 
i d cut off the retreat of every
german on this island 
now  you know what i m gonna do 
i m gonna go to palermo 
i m gonna beat that limey at messina
if it s the last thing i ever do 
hey  what s all this talk about taking
the vizzini road away from 2nd corps 
general alexander s orders 
road goes to montgomery 
now  that road was assigned to me 
how can i get north without it 
you know the terrain there 
i m sorry  brad  but monty s run
into tough opposition  very tough 
you wouldn t be taking advantage of
this situation  would you 
i don t know what you re talking about 
without that road  your army 
except for my 2nd corps   
   would be out of a job 
free for you to go into palermo 
who said anything about palermo 
i can read a map 
does alexander know
you ve pushed out this far 
that s a reconnaissance in force 
george   
   are you saying i ve got to slug
it out in those mountains   
   with heavy resistance 
just so you can make
a bigger splash than monty 
general   
   i just follow my orders 
like the simple old soldier i am 
general bradley 
sir  general alexander has heard
we re moving west 
he says here   stop immediately 
go no farther than agrigento 
repeat  stop  immediately   
that s what you think it says 
i think it was garbled
in transmission 
ask them to re transmit the message 
that ll take half a day at least 
yes  sir 
now  brad 
where were we 
we were talking about a simple   
   old soldier 
look at that  gentlemen 
compared to war   
   all other forms of human endeavor
shrink to insignificance 
let s go  sergeant 
move out 
give me that helmet 
come on  let s get out of here 
what silly son of a bitch
is in charge of this operation 
i don t know  but they
ought to hang him 
patton 
afternoon  padre 
padre  these men are here from the
states  looking over our program   
   for the spiritual welfare
of the men 
we ll take you right into palermo 
col  david toured us around
your quarters   
   and i saw a bible by your bed 
do you actually find time to read it 
i sure do 
every goddamn day 
sir  patton s taken palermo 
damn 
 cheering 
 band plays 
palermo s the most conquered city
in history 
first the phoenicians   
   the romans 
carthaginians  byzantines 
then came the arabs   
   spaniards  neapolitans 
now comes   
   the american army 
this is from general alexander  sir   
   reminding you that you are
not to take palermo 
send him a message  cod 
ask him if he
wants me to give it back 
patton  let me ask you a question
for a change 
you ve just come from washington 
how do they feel about our boys
taking palermo 
the general impression is  your army
barreled through token resistance   
   while montgomery faced the brunt
of the fighting 
don t they know we took on
the hermann göring division 
toughest outfit in the german army 
the people at home
are interested in you 
they re curious about your
pearl handle revolvers 
they re ivory  only a pimp
from a new orleans whorehouse   
   would carry a pearl handle 
what about your language 
when i want it to stick 
i give it to them loud and dirty 
what do your troops feel about that 
i don t want these men to love me 
i want them to fight for me 
ernie pyle says you have a secret
weapon here  general bradley 
ernie calls him  the gi general   
omar bradley is no secret 
he s a damn fine commander 
man 
what s your feeling about montgomery 
patton 
he s the best general the english have 
he seems more concerned with not
losing than he does about winning 
he s not aggressive enough 
is that correct 
look  i ve been getting into
a lot of trouble lately 
yesterday  the office told me
that my italian prisoners   
   didn t have enough latrine 
they didn t know what a
latrine was till i showed them 
if i ve said anything too critical
of my british colleague   
   let s forget about it 
i will tell you one thing  though 
off the record 
i m gonna beat that   
   gentleman to messina 
ah  freddie  do you realize what
this madman patton is saying 
he s going to save our skins
by taking messina 
this report might interest you 
here i am in these bloody marshes 
fighting malaria and germans   
   while he s taking palermo
and getting all the glory 
well 
now he s up against three good
german divisions and he s stuck 
he s not going to get messina 
that s reserved for the
british 8th army and me 
 bombs exploding 
it s time for a move  lucian  terry
allen s 1 st division is bogged down 
you re bogged down too 
what we need is another end run
just to break things loose 
  lucian  how s my fighter 
  fine  george 
come in  come in  we need another
one of your amphibious specialties 
lucian  i want you to send a
reinforced battalion by sea   
   to make a landing up here at brolo
behind the kraut lines 
you want me to do a land based attack 
right  i want a coordinated
attack the morning of the 11 th 
i don t think we can make it
by the 11 th 
  hell  it s only 15  20 miles 
  my boys have been dying for yards 
hm 
maybe you better kick a few butts
if you have to 
i recommended you for your dsm
in your last promotion 
i know what you can do when
you put your mind to it 
excuse me  sir 
i m sorry  but i can t
do the impossible 
you re too old an athlete to think
you can postpone a scheduled match 
you re an old athlete yourself 
you know matches are postponed 
if we can t back lucian up by land 
our end run could be a disaster 
those men might get caught
on the beach and cut to pieces 
  what s the matter 
bradley  all we re saying is   
   not to rush in until we re ready 
give him an extra day 
just one more day 
the landing is on 
we re going to messina 
we re going to get there before
montgomery does 
  what s so important about that 
  general truscott   
   if your conscience won t permit
you to conduct this operation   
   i ll find somebody who can 
general  it s your privilege to
relieve me anytime you want to 
this match will not be postponed 
any questions 
no  sir 
you re a very good man  lucian 
you want to guard against
being too conservative 
remember what
frederick the great said 
  l  audace  i audace 
toujours i audace   
go on  have a drink 
excuse me  sir  i won t be drinking
for the next couple of days 
if anything happens to those men 
i d like to be there with them 
you re not going  so forget about it 
you believe truscott s right 
no 
but you re gambling
with those boys  lives   
   just to beat montgomery
into messina 
if you pull it off  you re a hero 
but if you don t   
what happens to them 
the ordinary combat soldier 
he doesn t share in your dreams
of glory  he s stuck here 
he s living out every day  day to day 
with death tugging at his elbow 
there s one big difference
between you and me  george 
i do this job because i ve been
trained to do it 
you do it because   
   you love it 
the men on the beach are
catching hell  general 
the men are doing their best 
we have no replacements 
i can t break through to the coast 
i m going down there myself 
patton 
colonel 
how did he get over there 
patton 
what the hell are you waiting for 
looking for a place to ford  general 
i sent a patrol to reconnoiter 
patton  i ve done that  down there
this sewer s no more than 3 feet deep 
get that outfit cranked up
or you ll be out of a job 
  and put that helmet on 
  yes  sir 
move it  let s go 
  what s holding up this column 
  i don t know  sir 
planes 
come on  move it 
pull up over there 
  come on 
  what s going on here 
sir  these mules 
jackasses 
you let a column get stalled and
strafed on account of two jackasses  
 gunshot 
no  no 
now  dump them over the side
and clear this bridge 
we re pinned down because
we can t get air support 
nobody s getting any air support 
put fire into this battalion 
or i ll get somebody who can 
major 
  you the executive officer here 
  yes  sir 
  your name 
  waiker 
you re now commanding officer 
you ve got 4 hours to break through
that beachhead 
if you don t make it  i ll fire you 
50 000 men on this island would
like to shoot that son of a bitch 
please take me home 
take me home 
please take me home 
take me home 
  there he goes   old blood and guts   
  yeah  our blood  his guts 
hi  how are you  son 
where are you from  gomez 
california  sir 
me too 
  where were you hit 
  in the chest  sir 
well   
   this might be interesting to you 
the last german i saw had no chest 
didn t have any head either 
you get well quickly  son 
 indistinct 
 soldier cries 
what s the matter with you 
i guess i just can t take it  sir 
what did you say 
it s my nerves  sir 
i just can t stand
the shelling anymore 
your nerves 
hell  you re just a goddamn coward 
shut up 
i won t have
a yellow bastard crying   
   in front of these
brave  wounded men 
shut up 
don t admit this yellow bastard 
nothing wrong with him 
i won t have sons of bitches afraid to
fight stink up this place of honor 
you re going back to the front 
my friend 
you may get shot  you may get killed 
but you re going up to the fighting 
either that or i ll stand you up
in front of a firing squad 
i should shoot you myself 
you bastard  get him out of here 
send him up to the front 
you hear me  you goddamn coward 
i won t have cowards in my army 
i had to kick a few butts   
   but truscott finally broke through
to those people on the beach 
have you seen the casualty lists 
yes  i ve seen them 
what s the word from the coast road 
the 3rd division s east of brolo 
heading toward messina 
let s get over there 
i want to go in with the troops 
you go ahead  george 
i m not very good at that 
general bradley   
   it s time to consider how many
casualties we d have   
   if we were still crawling on
that goddamn road 
forward  march 
don t smirk  patton 
i shan t kiss you 
pity  i shaved close this morning
to prepare for getting smacked by you 
forward  march 
you wanted to see me  george 
got a letter here from ike 
i was rereading caesar s
commentaries last night 
in battle  caesar wore a red robe to
distinguish him from his men 
i was struck by that fact because 
 despicable    first time anybody s
ever applied that word to me 
well  at least it s a personal
reprimand  it s not official 
the man was yellow  he should ve
been tried for cowardice and shot 
people have taken a lot worse
than a little kick in the pants 
i ruffled his pride a bit 
what s that compared to war 
two weeks ago at palermo they said
i was the greatest general   
     since stonewall jackson 
  now they draw cartoons about you 
dirty bastard 
they got me holding a little gl
and kicking him with an iron boot 
you see that  what s on my boot 
a swastika 
on my boot 
an iron boot with a swastika 
 you will apologize to the soldier
you slapped   
   to all doctors and nurses present
in the tent at the time   
   to every patient in the tent
who can be reached   
   and last but not least
to the 7th army as a whole   
   through individual units 
one at a time   
god  i   
   feel low 
patton 
oh  god   
    thou art my god 
early will i seek thee 
my soul thirsteth for thee 
my flesh longeth for thee
in a dry and thirsty land 
so as i have seen thee
in the sanctuary 
my soul followeth hard after thee 
but those that seek my soul
to destroy it   
   shall go into the lower parts
of the earth 
they shall fall by the sword 
they shall be apportioned for foxes 
but the king shall rejoice in god 
everyone that sweareth by him
shall glory 
but the mouth of them
that speak lies   
   shall be stopped 
ten hut 
patton 
at ease 
i thought i d stand up here
and let you people see   
   if i am as big a son of a bitch
as some of you think i am 
i assure you i had no intention   
   of being either harsh or cruel
in my treatment of the   
   soldier in question 
my sole purpose was to try
to restore in him   
   some appreciation of his
obligations as a man   
   and as a soldier 
if one can shame a coward   
   i felt one might help him
to regain his self respect 
this was on my mind 
now  i freely admit   
   that my method was wrong   
   but i hope you understand
my motive   
   and will accept this   
   explanation   
   and this   
   apology 
  dismissed 
  ten hut 
good evening  general  i want to
report on a private poll i m taking 
what poll 
the fan mail 
eleven percent con 
89 percent pro 
and that 11   of protest  in most
cases  is both obscene and anonymous 
but the pro letters are mostly from
relatives and servicemen 
 i want you to know we re proud
our son is serving in your army 
from the newspaper  we re not clear
exactly what you did and why   
   but we want you to know
we re for you 
keep going  and god bless you   
keep going  huh 
where 
i thought you might like a sip
of wine  general  it s new year s 
you didn t celebrate at all
last night 
i m sick of sitting around this   
   royal doghouse 
we ve taken sicily 
i m ready for a new assignment 
maybe you ve got it 
here s a radio message  just came in 
cod 
i ve been relieved 
they ve relieved me from command
of the 7th army 
i don t believe it 
happy new year 
just a minute  sir 
since they re sure to give you
another command   
   isn t it logical they d
relieve you here first 
you mean command of all american
troops going into europe 
it s possible  i know it s been
discussed from time to time 
the logic of it is so obvious 
it couldn t mean anything else 
sir  i m going to open
this bottle of wine 
no  sir cod   
   but if you find a bottle of cognac 
i ll help you drink it 
  how you feeling tonight  general 
  not bad  not bad at all 
  get me some writing paper  will you 
  yes  sir 
your wife ever give you the devil
for not writing 
all the time  sir 
only i don t write as often as you
do  don t seem to get around to it 
lucky for us we got them 
who wants to marry a couple of
broken down old horse captains 
that s what my wife says to me
every time i come home  sir 
why are you up so late  george 
thought you d like a nice hot bath
or something 
i got this sleeping pill from the doc 
just in case you need it 
sleeping pill 
  what s going on here 
  i heard the news  sir 
  they announced it on the radio 
  what news 
about general bradley  sir  how they
gave him the top american command 
oh 
oh  yeah 
i just thought you might be
feeling kind of low  sir 
your writing things  sir 
here on the desk  sir 
yeah  thank you  george 
one little dog face 
one measly little slap 
that s what done it 
ah  george 
i wish i d kissed the son of a bitch 
 clapping 
 patton speaks in french 
he s paying tribute to the free french
forces under degaulle and leclerc 
 speaks in french 
and to the people of the resistance   
   who risk their lives
to help destroy the germans 
 france will be free again 
i give you my word   
 just as free french troops liberated
corsica  napoleon s place of birth   
   i will someday land in france to
liberate the birthplace of lafayette   
general  the reporters would like
a word with you 
  good afternoon 
  general 
can you tell us the purpose
of this visit to corsica 
general eisenhower ordered me here 
you wrote the mother of the boy you
slapped   the rat should ve been shot   
  is that true  general 
  no comment 
sir  i understand
gen  alexander suggested   
   you take over gen  clark s
italian campaign   
   but it was killed
due to the incident 
  no comment 
  can you say where you re going  sir 
off the record 
eisenhower s ordered me to malta 
interview concluded 
you plan on slapping
any soldiers there  general 
patton  in 1528  these forts
were defended by   
   400 knights of malta
and 800 mercenaries   
   against a force of 40 000 turks 
codman 
  still no word from gen  eisenhower 
  no  sir 
not even a response about
the two turkeys i sent for christmas 
no  sir 
go ahead  gentlemen 
take a closer look for yourselves 
looks like you boys have hitched
your wagon to a falling star 
pass the word 
if anyone wants out  i ll understand 
sir  i can speak for the entire staff 
we want to stay with you  no matter
what duty you re assigned to 
up in london  they re planning
the invasion of europe 
i ve trained my mind 
body and spirit for that 
what  in god s name  am i doing here 
all right 
let s get on to cairo 
see if the pyramids
are still standing 
  this place is for me 
  yes  sir  this way  sir 
whoever found it has a genius
for cloak and dagger 
who picked this cathouse 
i think it was gen  smith  sir 
to spite me  that son of a bitch 
  welcome to london  georgie 
  bedell  how are you 
  is ike here 
  he asked me to brief you 
would you excuse us  please 
let me put you straight about ike 
we hear a lot about you
criticizing his decisions 
not really  you know me 
i m just an old fool 
at times  i do wonder whether
he isn t a limey at heart 
george  this is the toughest coalition
ever attempted in history 
ike s trying to hold it together
and lick the germans at the same time 
  it s a hell of a job 
  i understand 
you have an important assignment
connected to the normandy invasion 
good  i ve studied the overlord plan
and there s a number of flaws in it 
you can t depend on monty taking
cannes by d day  he ll never make it 
i ve drawn up an alternate plan
to land at calais   
     following an air bombardment 
  will you just listen for a change 
ike stood by you when everyone 
i mean everyone   
   wanted patton
with a rope around his neck 
we re gonna let it leak out
that you are here undercover 
that you re preparing to invade
at the pas de calais 
we hope to pin down
the german 15th army there   
   so that they can t be used
against us at normandy 
is that all i m good for 
we re going to build an army
of 12 divisions around you 
all fictitious  of course 
dummy troop concentrations 
dummy landing craft   
   simulated radio traffic 
the germans are convinced that you
will lead the main invasion effort 
their agents will spot you soon   
   then we can move you to knutsford 
  what do i do there 
  nothing  absolutely nothing 
frankly  george  you re on probation 
take my advice and behave yourself 
remember   
   your worst enemy
is your own big mouth 
 band plays 
look at this nasty faced
son of a bitch  ready for combat 
i ll call him william
as in  the conqueror   
  sir  should we leave him in the car 
  no  good afternoon  ladies 
good afternoon 
 willie barks 
watch this  cod 
  sir  he ll kill that dog 
  i ll hold him 
i m terribly sorry  general 
did abigail frighten your dog 
that s quite all right  madam 
this way  sir 
your name isn t william 
it s willie 
woman 
my dear friends 
general george s  patton  jr  
has accepted our invitation   
   to say a few words to you   
   on the occasion
of this inaugural ceremony 
general patton is not here
in an official capacity   
   and i have assured him
most earnestly   
   that nothing he says
will be quoted 
may i present general patton 
  remember  sir  watch your language 
  yeah 
my dear ladies 
until today   
   my only experience
at welcoming has been   
   to welcome germans and italians
to the infernal region 
at this i have been
quite successful   
   since the troops  which i have had
the honor to command   
   have  to date  killed or captured   
   some 170 000 of our enemies 
i feel that such clubs as these
are of very real value   
   because i believe
with mr  bernard shaw   
   that the british and the americans
are two peoples   
   separated by a common language 
since it is the destiny of the british
and americans to rule the world   
   the better we know each other   
   the better we will do it 
the russians 
don t forget the russians 
i think that a club like this   
   is an ideal place
for promoting mutual understanding 
because as soon as our soldiers meet
and get to know the english ladies   
   and write home and tell our women
just how lovely you truly are   
   then the sooner the american ladies
will get jealous   
   and force this war
to a quick termination 
and then i ll get the chance to go
to the pacific and kill japanese 
narrator 
all over the nation   
   mass meetings are held to protest
general patton  s statement   
    that britain and america
will rule the post war world 
that russia will have no say 
congressional leaders like senator
clayburn foss are quick to react 
this man has insulted
our russian allies   
   implying anglo american world rule 
in my opinion  he should be
severely disciplined 
this time i didn t do a damn thing 
they promised there
wouldn t be any reporters 
i made a few remarks off the record 
ike told you to keep your mouth shut 
you know how suspicious the russians
are of the british and us 
i was only trying to be polite
to the old ladies 
if i d seen the russians there  i d
have mentioned the sons of bitches 
bedell  i don t know
anything about politics 
i have no political ambitions 
all i want to do is
to command an army in combat 
well  it s out of our hands now 
ike sent a message last night
to the chief of staff 
now it s up to general marshall
whether you stay here as a decoy   
   or he sends you home 
he s a good man 
at least he s a fair man 
i ll let it sit with him 
patton 
george   
   our war is over 
over  sir 
it s just a question of waiting
for the orders now 
i feel i m   
i m destined to achieve some
great thing  what  i don t know 
but this last incident is   
   so trivial in its nature
and so terrible in its effect 
it can t be an accident 
it has to be the work of god 
yes  sir 
the last great opportunity
of a lifetime   
   an entire world at war
and i m left out of it 
no  sir 
god will not permit this to happen 
i am going to be allowed
to fulfil my destiny 
his will be done 
narrator  in the greatest amphibious
operation ever attempted   
   a predawn naval bombardment
prepares the way   
   for allied soldiers to assault
the normandy beaches   
   and claw out a desperate foothold
on the continent of europe 
i knew montgomery couldn t take caen
on d day or d plus 10  and i said so 
and here they are all hung up
in the hedgerow country 
they should pivot the way von
schlieffen planned it in world war i 
then we might get a chance to do
some real broken field running 
but they don t listen to me 
what a way to enter
the continent of europe 
along with all the rest
of the spare parts 
sir  everything on this plane
is high priority 
gen  bradley wouldn t send for you
unless he had something in mind 
i ll tell you  cod 
i ve learned my lesson 
if i ever do get another chance 
i m gonna keep my mouth shut 
i m gonna play the game 
if i forget  you remind me 
  i ll give a gentle nudge in the ribs 
  give me a swift kick in the ass 
yes  sir 
welcome to france  sir 
hope the war s still on 
where s the boss 
right this way  sir 
patton  haven t seen you
since messina 
how are you 
you re doing a splendid job
decoying the jerries 
you ll forgive me 
i m off to the front 
best of everything  old boy 
by the way   
   intelligence confirms
that i m against rommel again 
rommel 
hi  how are you  george 
  pretty fair  brad  how are you 
  fine 
well  my  my 
isn t this plush 
looks like you re
bucking for archbishop 
chet hansen had this rig built for me 
george  sit down 
ike wanted me to talk to you
since we can level with each other 
that s right 
we re making 3rd army operational
when i take over 12th army group 
do i get it 
i ll be honest with you 
i ve had reservations 
you ve been my senior ever since
i left the academy 
you were the boss in north africa
and sicily and i just thought   
   well  it might be a problem for us 
it wouldn t bother me 
there s one other thing 
we re different kinds of people 
goddamn it  brad  you re always right 
with your brains and my screwy ideas 
we make a great team  like in sicily 
truthfully  if i had been your senior
in sicily  i would have relieved you 
brad   
   i m not crawling on my belly
to get a command 
for god s sake  get me in this fight 
the only way out of the doghouse
is to do something great 
i gotta get back in the war 
hitler s own people tried
to kill him a few days ago 
first thing you know 
it ll be over and   
i ll   
   keep my mouth shut 
i ll behave myself 
i give you my word 
george   
   i ve been working
on a plan called cobra 
i d like your opinion 
we ve been slugging through
hedgerow country   
   half an acre a day
and we ve got to find a way out 
i want to use this road 
the saint lô periers road 
monty will pin down
the enemy forces at caen 
we ll pulverize an area
31 2 miles wide with bombing 
then seven divisions will follow 
the 3rd army will swing around here  a
sweeping end run right across france 
what do you think 
i think you ll need a screwball old
cavalryman to command the 3rd army 
george   
   ike came to that conclusion
in london three months ago 
he what 
why  that dirty  
i m sorry  i m sorry 
i promise to keep my mouth shut 
 speaking in german 
george could have the courtesy
to tell us where he s going 
good god  look at that 
where you going  general 
berlin 
i m going to personally shoot
that paper hanging son of a bitch 
 cheering 
hold it  hold it 
this place isn t on the map 
you know why 
we ve run clear off the map 
give george a headline 
and he s good for another 30 miles 
 honking 
soldier 
atten hut 
hold it 
pay attention  we re gonna clean
this mess up right now 
let s move this vehicle out this way 
this one out this way 
back that thing up there 
and we ll take this one here 
all right  get up off your ass 
let s go now

  general 
general bradley wants to have
a word with you 
okay  come on 
okay  hold it up  take over 
george  you d make a good traffic cop 
george this drive has been
magnificent   
   but i m sorry to say
i have to slow you down 
  what the hell for 
  we ll have to cut off your supplies 
gasoline  ammunition  everything 
we re up against new priorities 
  i think i smell montgomery 
  take it easy  george 
there are serious issues involved 
political issues 
by god  it is montgomery 
the launching sites for the b 2 bombs
are all in his area 
churchill wants those bases destroyed 
hitler kills more civilians
in london than soldiers 
expect montgomery to do anything 
you give me gasoline and i ll gain
ground with it  kill germans too 
give me 400 000 gallons 
i ll go to berlin 
george  i can t do it 
the siegfried line
is an empty shell 
they stripped the equipment
and sent it east 
it s crawling with cows 
i can punch through in two days 
there s no use in arguing with me 
it wasn t my idea 
why did you pick me to command 
i didn t pick you 
ike picked you 
george  you have performed
brilliantly 
you are loyal  dedicated 
you re one of the best i ve got 
but you don t know when to shut up 
george  you re a pain in the neck 
i have a lot of faults  brad 
but ingratitude isn t one of them 
i owe you a lot 
hell  i know i m a prima donna 
i admit it 
what i can t stand about monty is 
he won t admit it 
 tank sputters 
captain  the bailey s run out of gas 
the point tank has run out too 
and there s a kraut column up ahead 
yeah  i know 
patton 
were you in command here  captain 
i was in command 
my tank platoon was supporting
an infantry company 
tanks ran out of gas 
so we had to fight it out 
we started 11 00 last night 
finished a couple hours ago 
this morning the fighting
was hand to hand 
i had a dream last night 
in my dream it came to me   
   that right now the whole nazi reich
is mine for the taking 
think about that  cod 
i was nearly sent home in disgrace 
now i have precisely
the right instrument   
   at precisely the right moment of
history and exactly the right place 
the saar 
this will change too  very quickly 
like a planet spinning off
into the universe 
a moment like this won t come again
for 1000 years 
all i need is a few
miserable gallons of gasoline 
right now  the weak spot is here 
in 10 days  we could be in berlin 
what about the fortifications
that were done in metz 
fixed fortifications  huh 
monuments to the stupidity of man 
when mountain ranges and oceans
could be overcome   
   anything built by man
can be overcome 
you know how i m sure
they re finished out there 
the carts 
they re using carts to move
their wounded and the supplies 
the carts came to me in my dream 
i couldn t figure it out 
then i remembered   
   that nightmare in the snow 
the agonizing retreat from moscow 
how cold it was 
they threw the wounded and what was
left of the supplies in the carts 
napoleon was finished 
not any color left 
not even the red of blood 
only the snow 
look at this  cod 
i love it 
god help me  i do love it so 
i love it more than my life 
narrator  paris is liberated 
and french troops lead the way 
the allies march into the city
after four years of nazi occupation 
the hard fighting french
2nd armored division   
   under major general
jacques leclerc   
   gets an unforgettable welcome   
   as they enter their beloved paris 
in a powerful drive to the north   
    general montgomery cuts off and
bypasses the french coastal towns   
   of boulogne  calais and dunkirk 
pushing on to capture the vital
belgian port of antwerp 
meanwhile  the main body
of patton  s army   
   resupplied now and rolling like a
juggernaut  slashes toward the saar 
nazi resistance appears to crumble 
it seems that nothing can stop our
troops from driving on into germany 
  sir  general bradley on your line 
  good  good 
brad  listen  i ve got a bridgehead
across the saar 
i m on my way to germany 
wait a minute  george 
there s a lot of trouble up north 
i want you to transfer tank armor
to middleton s 8th corps right away 
brad  you can t do that 
george  listen 
i don t have time to argue 
there s a lot of enemy activity
up around ardennes 
no  i don t know how serious it is   
   but ike wants us to meet
with bedell smith tomorrow at verdun 
be there at 1100 
yes  sir 
patton  there s absolutely no reason
for us to assume   
   that the germans are mounting
a major offense 
the weather is awful
and their supplies are low 
the germans haven t mounted a winter
attack since frederick the great 
therefore i believe that s exactly
what they re going to do 
i want you to start making
contingency plans   
   for pulling out
of our eastward attack 
changing directions 90 degrees 
moving up to luxembourg 
don t look so stunned  gentlemen 
i want you to plan
for three possible axes of attack 
from diekirch  due north 
from orléans to bastogne 
from neufchâteau against the german
left flank 
we ve identified four german armies 
the 7th  the 5th panzer 
6th ss panzer and the 15th 
they ve hit us with 26 divisions 
they ve overran two regimens
of the 106th division 
and 7500 of our men
were forced to surrender 
our concern is that von rundstedt   
   has the 101 st airborne trapped
here at bastogne 
bastogne  by the way  is the key
to this entire area 
if we can hold it  we can break up
the entire german offensive 
if they take it 
we re in serious trouble 
ike wants to know if anybody can go   
   and relieve the 101 st
before they re torn to pieces 
there s nothing montgomery can do 
at any rate  not for some weeks 
what about you  george 
i can attack with three divisions
in 48 hours 
i d give myself some leeway 
ike wants a realistic estimate 
george 
you re in the middle of a fight now 
it s over a hundred miles to bastogne 
my staff s already working
out the details 
frankly  i don t see how
it s possible 
not in this kind of weather 
i should have thought you d want
to fall back and regroup 
not me  i don t like to pay
for the same real estate twice 
tedder 
but what about your men 
you can t cart them off 100 miles 
expecting them to attack without rest 
i trained these men 
they ll do what i tell them to do 
we hadn t realized you were
so popular with your troops  general 
i m not  they ll do it
because they re good soldiers 
and because they realize  as i do 
that we can still lose this war 
then i think i can speak
for field marshal montgomery 
he d say you re asking
the impossible of your men 
of course he would 
cause he s never realized that s
what we re in business for 
 bomb explodes 
general mcauliffe refused
a german surrender demand 
you know what he said 
what 
he said   nuts   
keep them moving  colonel 
a man that eloquent has to be saved 
 silence 
this is where it pays off 
the training and discipline 
no other outfit in the world 
pulled out of a winter battle 
move a hundred miles 
going to a major attack with no rest 
no sleep  no hot food 
god  god  i m proud of these men 
sir  von rundstedt s thrown another
panzer division against bastogne 
101 st airborne s barely holding on 
we need damned air cover  if we had
decent weather  we might make it 
carver 
general mason  sir 
hello  mase 
listen  we re short on foot soldiers 
cannibalize your antiaircraft units
and turn them into riflemen 
yes  every last one you can find 
good evening  general 
i just got the weather report
for tomorrow  more snow 
there goes our air cover 
we may have to wait
for better weather 
brave men dying up there  i won t
wait  not an hour  not a minute 
going to keep moving 
is that clear 
we re going to attack all night
and attack tomorrow morning 
if we re not victorious   
   let no one come back alive 
you know something  general 
sometimes  they can t tell when
you re acting and when you re not 
it isn t important for them to know 
it s only important for me to know 
  you want to see me  general 
  oh  yeah  chaplain 
i m tired of 3rd army
having to fight germans   
   with supreme command 
no gasoline   
   and now this ungodly weather 
i want a prayer  a weather prayer 
a weather prayer  sir 
yes  let s see if you can t get god
working with us 
gonna take a thick rug
for that kind of praying 
i don t care if it
takes a flying carpet 
i don t know how this
will be received  general 
praying for good weather
so we can kill our fellow man 
i assure you  because of
my relations with the almighty   
   if you write a good prayer 
we ll have good weather 
and i expect that prayer
within an hour 
yes  sir 
 almighty and most merciful father   
   we humbly beseech thee   
   of thy great goodness   
   to restrain this
immoderate weather   
   with which we ve had to contend 
grant us fair weather for battle 
graciously hearken to us   
   as soldiers who call upon thee   
    that armed with thy power   
    we may advance
from victory to victory   
   and crush the oppression   
   and wickedness of our enemies   
   and establish thy justice   
   among men and nations 
amen    
weather s perfect 
cod  get me that chaplain 
he s in good with the lord
and i want to decorate him

    to relieve its 18 000 defenders   
   on the day after christmas 
during this operation 
3rd army moved farther and faster

 music plays 
excuse me  sir 
general katkov would like to know
if you ll join him   
   to drink to the surrender
of germany 
my compliments to the general 
please inform him that i do not care
to drink with him   
   or any other russian
son of a bitch 
sir   
   i cannot tell the general that 
you tell him that 
tell him word for word 
 speaks in russian 
 speaks in russian 
the general says he thinks that   
   you are a son of a bitch too 
okay  i ll drink to that 
one son of a bitch to another 
 speaks in russian 
 cheering 
is it true that roosevelt 
before he died   
   promised you
a command in the pacific 
yes  but now that he s gone  i don t
think there s much chance of that 
doug macarthur
doesn t want me up there 
we re told of  wonder weapons 
the germans were working on 
long range rockets 
push button bombing   
   weapons that don t need soldiers 
 wonder weapon  
my god  i don t see
the wonder in them 
killing without heroics  nothing
is glorified  nothing is reaffirmed 
no heroes  no cowards  no troops 
no generals 
only those that are left alive
and those that are left   
   dead 
i m glad i won t live to see it 
reporter  it s said you re still
using former nazis in key positions 
despite the denazification policy 
well  if i m supplied
with trained personnel   
   i ll get rid of the nazis 
until then  i ll use them to keep
the railroads and telephones working 
after all  didn t most
ordinary nazis join the party   
   in about the same way americans
become republicans or democrats 
yes  that s about it 
you agree that national policy be made
by civilians  not by the military 
of course  but the politicians
never let us finish 
they always stop short and leave us
with another war 
you thinking about our russian allies 
did you say if you found your army
between the germans and the russians   
   you d attack in both directions 
no  i never said that 
i never said any such thing 
but i wish i had 
 laughing 
sir  there s a call on your line from
supreme headquarters  general smith 
bedell 
ike is furious 
how could you compare republicans
and democrats to the nazi party 
and the statement
that you refuse to denazify   
   has the russians  the british 
everybody  screaming 
well  the hell
with the mongoloid russians 
we ve given them berlin  prague 
god knows what else 
they gonna dictate policy too 
george  don t be a fool 
the war in europe is over 
washington dictates policy 
the war shouldn t be over  we should
stop pussyfooting about the russians 
we ll have to fight them anyway  why
not do it now  when the army s here 
instead of disarming germans let s
get them to help fight the bolsheviks 
you better shut up 
this line may be tapped 
i don t care  i ll tell you   
   we ve been fighting
the wrong people 
you and i don t have to get involved 
you re so soft about it 
leave it to me  in 10 days
i ll have us at war with them   
   and make it look like their fault 
george  you re mad 
you re absolutely out of your mind 
well  i m no diplomat 
i m a combat soldier 
that s all they understand 
get ike to give me the word 
and i ll kick them back to russia 
shall i call the artist back  sir 
oh  the hell with it 
nobody wants to see a picture of me 
i m mad 
don t you know that 
field marshal montgomery 
his majesty is prepared   
   to receive the next chief
of the imperial general staff 
thank you 
thank you 
take care of yourself 
george 
well  gentlemen   
   all good things
must come to an end 
and the best thing
that s happened to me   
   in my life   
   has been   
   uh   
   the honor   
   and privilege   
   of commanding the 3rd army 
goodbye   
   and god bless you 
brad   
   they ve taken the 3rd army
away from me 
i know 
i thought we could have dinner
together tonight 
thank you  brad 
that s damn thoughtful 
i appreciate it 
right now  i think i ll take
willie for a walk 
george  look out 
after all i ve been through   
   imagine getting killed
by an oxcart 
no  brad  there s only one proper way
for a professional soldier to die 
that s from the last bullet
of the last battle of the last war 
at least the 3rd army earned its pay 
in our drive across europe 
we liberated   
    12 000 cities and towns   
   and inflicted a million and a half
enemy casualties 
i sense from now on  just being
a good soldier won t mean a thing 
i m afraid we re gonna have to be
diplomats  administrators  you name it 
god help us 
george  i want to say one thing 
you ve done a magnificent job
here in europe 
that s right  george 
that soldier you slapped did more to
win the war than any other private 
i ll see you for dinner 
six thirty 
patton 
for over a thousand years   
   roman conquerors
returning from the wars   
   enjoyed the honor of a triumph 
a tumultuous parade 
in the procession came trumpeters
and musicians and strange animals   
   from the conquered territories   
    together with carts laden with
treasure and captured armaments 
the conqueror rode
in a triumphal chariot   
    the dazed prisoners
walking in chains before him 
sometimes  his children 
robed in white   
   stood with him in the chariot 
or rode the trace horses 
a slave stood behind the conqueror   
   holding a golden crown   
   and whispering in his ear
a warning   
    that all glory   
   is fleeting
