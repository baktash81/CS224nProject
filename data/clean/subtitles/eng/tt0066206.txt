roman conquerors returning wars
enjoyed honor triumph tumultuous parade
procession came trumpeters musicians strange animals
conquered territories
together carts laden treasure captured armaments
conqueror rode triumphal chariot
dazed prisoners walking chains
sometimes children robed white
stood chariot rode trace horses
slave stood behind conqueror
holding golden crown
whispering ear warning
glory
fleeting
