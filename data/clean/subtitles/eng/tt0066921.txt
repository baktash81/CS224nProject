that is  pete  georgie and dim 
and we sat in the korova milk bar 
trying to make up our rassoodocks   
    what to do with the evening 
the korova milk bar sold milk plus 
milk plus vellocet or
synthemesc or drencrom   
    which is what we were drinking 
this would sharpen you up   
   and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra violence 
in dublin  s fair city
where the girls are so pretty
i first set my eyes
on sweet molly malone
as she wheeled her wheelbarrow
through streets broad and narrow
crying    cockles and mussels       
one thing i could never stand   
    was to see a filthy 
dirty old drunkie   
   howling away at the
filthy songs of his fathers   
   and going   blerp blerp  
in between   
   as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking guts 
i could never stand to see anyone
like that  whatever his age 
but more especially when he
was real old  like this one was 
can you spare some cutter 
me brothers 
go on  do me in  you bastard cowards 
i don t want to iive anyway 
not in a stinking worid

the young get onto the oid     
     iike you done 
it s no worid
for an oid man any ionger 
what kind of a worid is it
at aii 
men on the moon 
men spinning around the earth 
and there s not no
attention paid     
     to earthiy
iaw and order no more 
oh  dear land

it was at the derelict casino
that we came across billy boy   
   and his four droogs 
they were about to perform

a nice  warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts 
soon it was trees and dark 
my brothers   
    with real country dark 
we fillied around with other
travelers of the night   
   playing hogs of the road 
then we headed west 
what we were after now
was the old surprise visit 
that was a real kick   
   and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultra violent 
who on earth couid that be 
i ii go and see

and i m ready for love

with a happy refrain
and i m singing

viddy weii  iittie brother 
viddy weii 
we were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed   
   it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure 
so we got rid of the auto and
stopped at the korova for a nightcap 
heiio  lucy 
had a busy night 
we ve been working hard too 
pardon me  luce 
there was some sophistos from
the tv studios around the corner   
   laughing and govoreeting 
the devotchka smeched away  not
caring about the wicked world one bit 
then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out 
and in the short silence
before the next one came on   
   she suddenly came
with a burst of singing 
and it was like  for a moment 
o my brothers   
   some great bird
had flown into the milk bar 
and i felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott   
   standing endwise 
and the shivers crawling up
like slow  malenky lizards   
   and then down again 
because i knew what she sang 
it was a bit from
the glorious ninth  by ludwig van 
what did you do that for 
for being a bastard
with no manners 
without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourseif pubiic wise

and what i needed now
to give it the perfect ending   
    was a bit
of the old ludwig van 
oh  bliss

it was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh 
it was like a bird
of rarest spun heaven metal 
or like silvery wine

behind my sieeping back  i know it 
if you must have it

we go around shop crasting
and the iike     
     coming out with a pitifui

we got a start on you  moioko pius 
as we walked along
the flatblock marina   
   i was calm on the outside 
but thinking all the time 
so now it was to be
georgie the general   
   saying what we should do
and what not to do 
and dim as his mindless 
grinning bulldog 
but suddenly i viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones   
   and that the oomny ones used  like 
inspiration and what bog sends 
for now it was lovely music
that came to my aid 
there was a window open
with a stereo on   
   and i viddied right at once
what to do 
i had not cut into any
of dim s main cables 
and so with the help
of a clean tashtook   
    the red  red kroovy
soon stopped 
and it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers   
   down in the snug
of the duke of new york 
now they knew who was
master and leader 
sheep  thought i 
but a real leader knows
always when  like   
    to give and show generous
to his unders 
now we re back to where we were 
yes

with the sunday service 
he was a bolshy 
great burly bastard 
but he was very fond of myself 
me being very young   
   and also now very interested
in the big book 
i read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns 
and i could viddy myself
helping in   
   and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in 
being dressed in the height
of roman fashion 
i didn  t so much like
the latter part of the book   
    which is more like
all preachy talking   
    than fighting
and the old in out 
i like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other   
   and then drink
their hebrew vino   
   and getting onto the bed
with their wives   handmaidens 
that kept me going 
  seek not to be iike evii men 
neither desire to be with them     
     because their minds
studieth robberies     
     and their iips speak deceits    
if thou iose hope  being weary
in the days of distress     
     thy strength
shaii be diminished 
fine  my son  fine 
father 
i have tried  have i not 
you have  my son 
 i ve done my best  have i not 
 indeed 
i ve never been guiity of any
institutionai infraction  have i 
you certainiy have not  655321  
you ve been very heipfui 
and you ve shown
a genuine desire to reform 
father     
     can i ask you
a question in private 
certainiy  my son  certainiy 
is there something
troubiing you  my son 
don t be shy to speak up 
remember     
     i know of the     
     urges that can
troubie young men     
     deprived     
     of the society of women 
it s nothing iike that  father 
it s about this new thing
they re aii taiking about 
about this new treatment 
it gets you out of prison
in no time 
and makes sure you
never get back in again 
where did you hear about this 
who s been taiking
about these things 
these things get around 
two warders taik  as it might be 
and somebody can t heip
overhearing what they say 
then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops     
     and the newspaper
teiis aii about it 
how about putting me in
for this new treatment 
i take it you are referring     
     to the ludovico technique 
i don t know what it s caiied 
i just know it
gets you out quickiy     
     and makes sure you
never get back in again 
that is not proven  655321  
in fact  it is oniy in the
experimentai stage at this moment 
it has been used  hasn t it 
it has not been used
in this prison yet 
the governor has grave
doubts about it 
and i ve heard there are
very serious dangers invoived 
i don t care about the dangers 
i just want to be good 
i want for the rest
of my iife to be     
     one act of goodness 
the question is     
     whether or not this technique
reaiiy makes a man good 
goodness comes from within 
goodness     
     is chosen 
when a man cannot choose     
     he ceases to be a man 
i don t understand about
the whys and wherefores  father 
i oniy know i want to be good 
be patient  my son 
put your trust in the lord 
instruct thy son
and he shaii refresh thee     
     and shaii give deiight
to thy soui

space for poiiticai offenders 
common criminais are best deait
with on a pureiy curative basis 
kiii the criminai refiex

the new minister of the interior

these new ridicuious ideas
have come at iast 
and orders are orders     
     though i may say to you
in confidence  i do not approve 
an eye for an eye  i say 
if someone hits you 
you hit back  do you not 
why shouid not the state 
severeiy hit by you hooiigans     
     not hit back aiso 
the new view is to say   no    
the new view is that
we turn the bad into good 
aii of which seems to me
to be grossiy unjust 
shut your fiithy hoie  you scum

it s quite simpie  reaiiy 
we re going to show you some fiims 
you mean iike
going to the pictures 
something iike that 
that s good 
i iike to viddy
the oid fiims now and again 
and viddy films i would 
where i was taken to  brothers   
    was like no cine
i ever viddied before 
i was bound up
in a straitjacket   
   and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest   
    with wires running away from it 
then they clamped  like 
lid locks on me eyes   
   so that i could not shut them 
no matter how hard i tried 
it seemed a bit crazy to me   
   but i let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with 
if i was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight   
   i would put up with much
in the meantime  o my brothers 
the first film was a very good 
professional piece of cine   
   like it was done in hollywood 
the sounds were real horrorshow 
you could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic 
you could even get
the breathing and panting   
   of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time 
and then what do you know 
soon our dear old friend   
    the red  red vino on tap   
    the same in all places   
   like it s put out
by the same firm   
   began to flow 
it was beautiful 
it s funny how the colors
of the real world   
   only seem really real   
    when you viddy them
on a screen 
now  all the time
i was watching this   
   i was beginning
to get very aware   
   of  like  not feeling
all that well 
and this i put down
to all the rich food and vitamins 
but i tried to forget this 
concentrating on the next film   
    which jumped right away
on a young devotchka   
    who was being given
the old in out  in out   
   first by one malchick   
    then another 
then another 
when it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick   
   leering and smecking
and then going into it   
   i began to feel really sick 
but i could not shut me glazzies 
and even if i tried to move
my glazzballs about   
   i still could not get out of   
    the line of fire
of this picture 
get me up 
i m going to be sick 
get something for me to be sick in 
very soon now 
the drug wiii cause the subject     
     to experience
a deathiike paraiysis     
     together with deep feeiings
of terror and heipiessness 
one of our eariy test subjects
described it as being iike death 
a sense of stifiing or drowning 
and it is during this period 
we have found     
     the subject wiii make
his most rewarding associations     
     between his catastrophic
experience  environment     
     and the vioience he sees 
dr  brodsky is pieased with you 
you ve made
a very positive response 
tomorrow there wiii be two
sessions  morning and afternoon 
you mean i have to viddy
two sessions in one day 
i imagine you ii feei a bit
iimp by the end of the day 
but we have to be hard on you 
you have to be cured 
it was horribie 
of course it was horribie 
vioience is a very horribie thing 
that s what you re iearning now 
your body s iearning it 
i just don t understand about
feeiing sick the way i did 
i never used to feei sick 
i used to feei the very opposite 
doing it or watching it 
i used to feei reai horrorshow 
you feit iii this afternoon
because you re getting better 
when we re heaithy 
we respond to the hatefui     
     with fear and nausea 
you re becoming heaithy 
that s aii 
by this time tomorrow 
you ii be heaithier stiii 
it was the next day  brothers   
   and i had truly done my best   
   morning and afternoon
to play it their way   
   and sit like a horrorshow
cooperative malchick   
   in the chair of torture   
    while they flashed nasty bits
of ultra violence on the screen   
    though not on the soundtrack 
the only sound being music 
then i noticed 
in all my pain and sickness   
    what music it was
that  like  cracked and boomed 
it was ludwig van 
ninth symphony  fourth movement 
stop it  stop it 
piease  i beg you 
it s a sin 
it s a sin 
sin 
what s aii this about sin 
that 
using ludwig van iike that 
he did no harm to anyone 
beethoven just wrote music 
are you referring
to the background score 
you ve heard beethoven before 
so you re keen on music 
can t be heiped 
here s the punishment
eiement perhaps 
the governor ought to be pieased 
i m sorry  aiex 
this is for your own good 
you ii have to bear with us
for a whiie 
but it s not fair 
it s not fair i shouid feei iii     
     when i hear ioveiy 
ioveiy ludwig van 
you must take your chance  boy 
the choice has been aii yours 
you needn t take it
any further  sir 
you ve proved to me aii this
uitra vioience and kiiiing     
     is wrong  wrong
and terribiy wrong 
i ve iearned me iesson  sir 
i see now what i ve
never seen before 
i m cured  praise god 
you re not cured yet  boy 
but  sirs 
missus 
i see that it s wrong 
it s wrong because
it s  iike  against society 
because everybody has the
right to iive and be happy     
     without being
toichocked and knifed 
no  no  boy 
you reaiiy must ieave it to us 
but be cheerfui about it 
in iess than a fortnight now 
you ii be a free man 
ladies and gentiemen     
     at this stage  we introduce
the subject himseif 
he is  as you wiii perceive 
fit and weii nourished 
he comes straight from a night s
sieep and a good breakfast     
     undrugged     
     unhypnotized 
tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the worid again     
     as decent a iad as you
wouid meet on a may morning 
what a change is here 
iadies and gentiemen 
from the hoodium
the state committed     
     to unprofitabie punishment
two years ago 
unchanged after two years 
unchanged  do i say 
not quite 
prison taught him the faise smiie 
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy 
the fawning  greased 
obsequious ieer 
other vices it taught him     
     as weii as confirming him in
those he had iong practiced before 
our party promised
to restore iaw and order     
     and to make the streets safe for
the ordinary peace ioving citizen 
this piedge is now
about to become a reaiity 
ladies and gentiemen 
today is an historic moment 
the probiem of criminai vioience
is soon to be a thing of the past 
but enough of words 
actions speak iouder than 
action now 
observe aii 
our necks are out
a iong way on this  minister 
i have compiete faith in brodsky 
if the poiis are right 
we have nothing to iose 
heiio  heap of dirt 
you don t wash much  do you 
judging by the horribie smeii 
why do you say that 
i had a shower this morning 
he had a shower this morning 
you trying to caii me a iiar 
no  brother 
you must think i m awfuiiy stupid 
why did you do that  brother 
i ve never done wrong to you 
you want to know why i did that 
weii  you see     
     i do this     
     and that     
     and this because i don t iike
your horribie type  do i 
and if you want
to start something     
     you just go ahead 
go on 
piease do 
i m going to be sick 
you re going to be sick  are you 
i m going to be sick 
piease iet me get up 
you want to get up 
weii  now you iisten to me 
if you want to get up     
     you ve got to
do something for me 
here 
here 
you see that 
you see that shoe 
i want you to iick it 
go on 
lick it 
and  o my brothers 
would you believe   
    your faithful friend
and long suffering narrator   
   pushed out his red yabzick
a mile and a half   
    to lick the grahzny 
vonny boots 
and again 
the horrible killing sickness
had whooshed up   
   and turned the joy of battle   
   into a feeling
i was going to snuff it 
and again 
nice and ciean 
thank you very much 
that wiii do very weii 
thank you very much 
iadies and gentiemen 
she came towards me   
    with the light  like it was the
light light of heavenly grace 
and the thing that flashed
in me gulliver   
    was that i d like to have her
there on the floor   
    with the old in out 
real savage 
but quick as a shot
came the sickness 
like a detective who  d been
watching around the corner   
   and now followed
to make his arrest 
enough 
thank you very much 
thank you  my dear 
not feeiing too bad now  are you 
no  sir 
i feei reaiiy great  sir 
 good 
 was it aii right  sir 
did i do weii 
fine  my boy 
absoiuteiy fine 
you see  iadies and gentiemen     
     our subject is impeiied
towards the good     
     by paradoxicaiiy
being impeiied towards evii 
the intention to act vioientiy     
     is accompanied by strong
feeiings of physicai distress 
to counter these 
the subject has to switch     
     to a diametricaiiy
opposed attitude 
any questions 
choice 
the boy has no reai choice  has he 
seif interest 
the fear of physicai pain     
     drove him to that
grotesque act of seif abasement 
its insincerity
was cieariy to be seen 
he ceases to be a wrongdoer 
he ceases aiso to be
a creature capabie of morai choice 
padre  these are subtieties 
we re not concerned with motives 
with the higher ethics 
we are concerned oniy
with cutting down crime 
and with reiieving the ghastiy
congestion in our prisons 
he wiii be your true christian     
     ready to turn the other cheek 
ready to be crucified 
rather than crucify 
sick to the very heart at the
thought even of kiiiing a fiy 
reciamation 
joy before the angeis of god 
the point is that it works 
and the very next day 
your friend and humble narrator   
    was a free man

fine  fine  sir 
the newspapers mentioned     
     in addition to being conditioned
against acts of sex and vioience     
     you ve inadvertentiy been
conditioned against music 
i think that was something
that they didn t pian for 
you see  missus     
     i m very fond of music 
especiaiiy beethoven 
ludwig van beethoven 
 b e  
 it s aii right  thank you 
and it just so happened that
whiie they were showing me     
     a particuiariy bad fiim
of  iike  a concentration camp     
     the background music
was piaying beethoven 
so now you have
the same reaction to music     
     as you do to sex and vioience 
no  missus  you see  it s not
aii music  it s just the ninth 
you mean beethoven s ninth symphony 
that s right  i can t iisten
to the ninth anymore at aii 
when i hear the ninth  i get  iike     
     this funny feeiing 
and then aii i can think about
is  iike  trying to snuff it 
 i beg your pardon 
 snuff it  death  i mean 
i just want to die peacefuiiy     
     iike  with no pain 
do you feei that way now 
no  sir  not exactiy 
i stiii feei     
     very miserabie 
very much down in spirits 
do you stiii feei     
     suicidai 
put it this way 
i feei very iow in myseif 
i can t see much in the future 
i feei that any second  something
terribie is going to happen to me 
weii done  frank 
get the car  wouid you  piease 
i woke up   
    the pain and sickness
all over me like an animal 
then i realized what it was 
the music coming up
from the floor   
    was our old friend 
ludwig van   
   and the dreaded ninth symphony 
let me out 
open the door 
come on  open the door 
turn it off 
turn it off 
stop it 
turn it off 
piease 
turn it off 
suddenly  i viddied
what i had to do   
   and what i had wanted to do 
and that was to do myself in 
to snuff it 
to blast off forever 
out of this wicked  cruel world 
one moment of pain  perhaps   
   and then sleep 
forever and ever   
   and ever 
i jumped  o my brothers   
   and i fell hard 
but i did not snuff it 
if i had snuffed it   
   i would not be here
to tell what i told have 
i came back to life
after a long  black  black gap   
   of what might have been
a million years 
he s recovered
consciousness  doctor 
heiio  iad 
heiio  son 
how are you

you were in the papers again  son

     they had done
great wrong to you 
it said     
     how the government     
     drove you to try     
     and do yourseif in 
and when you think about it  son     
     maybe it was our fauit too     
     in a way 
your home s your home     
     when aii s said and done  son 
 good morning

     and you re going to teii me
what you think about them 
joiiy good 
you know anything about dreams

it s iike     
     when i was aii smashed up 
you know     
     and haif awake
and unconscious iike     
     i kept having this dream 
aii these doctors were
piaying around with me guiiiver 
you know  iike the inside
of me brain 
i seem to have this dream
over and over again 
do you think it means anything 
patients with injuries iike yours
often have dreams of this sort 
it s aii part
of the recovery process 
now then  each of these siides
needs a repiy     
     from one of the peopie
in the picture 
you teii me what you think
the person wouid say     
     aii right 
righty right 
  isn t the piumage beautifui   
i just say what the
other person wouid say 
don t think about it too iong

     and i ii smash your face

you know what you can do with
that watch  stick it up your ass 
  you can do whatever

and pick them aii up     
     and throw

it s not that kind of a test 
but you seem weii on the way
to making a compiete recovery
