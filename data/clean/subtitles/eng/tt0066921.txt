that is pete georgie and dim
and we sat in the korova milk bar
trying to make up our rassoodocks
what to do with the evening
the korova milk bar sold milk plus
milk plus vellocet or
synthemesc or drencrom
which is what we were drinking
this would sharpen you up
and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultraviolence
in dublin s fair city
where the girls are so pretty
i first set my eyes
on sweet molly malone
as she wheeled her wheelbarrow
through streets broad and narrow
crying cockles and mussels
one thing i could never stand
was to see a filthy
dirty old drunkie
howling away at the
filthy songs of his fathers
and going blerp blerp
in between
as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking guts
i could never stand to see anyone
like that whatever his age
but more especially when he
was real old like this one was
can you spare some cutter

men spinning around the earth
and theres not no
attention paid

a nice warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts
soon it was trees and dark
my brothers
with real country dark
we fillied around with other
travelers of the night
playing hogs of the road
then we headed west
what we were after now
was the old surprise visit
that was a real kick
and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultraviolent
who on earth couid that be

viddy weii iittie brother

we were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed
it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure
so we got rid of the auto and
stopped at the korova for a nightcap
heiio lucy
had a busy night
weve been working hard too
pardon me luce
there was some sophistos from
the tv studios around the corner
laughing and govoreeting
the devotchka smeched away not
caring about the wicked world one bit
then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out
and in the short silence
before the next one came on
she suddenly came
with a burst of singing
and it was like for a moment
o my brothers
some great bird
had flown into the milk bar
and i felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott
standing endwise
and the shivers crawling up
like slow malenky lizards
and then down again
because i knew what she sang
it was a bit from
the glorious ninth by ludwig van
what did you do that for
for being a bastard
with no manners
without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourseif pubiicwise

and what i needed now
to give it the perfect ending
was a bit
of the old ludwig van
oh bliss

it was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh
it was like a bird
of rarest spun heaven metal
or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship
gravity all nonsense now

the flatblock marina
i was calm on the outside
but thinking all the time
so now it was to be
georgie the general
saying what we should do
and what not to do
and dim as his mindless
grinning bulldog
but suddenly i viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones
and that the oomny ones used like
inspiration and what bog sends
for now it was lovely music
that came to my aid
there was a window open
with a stereo on
and i viddied right at once
what to do
i had not cut into any
of dims main cables
and so with the help
of a clean tashtook
the red red kroovy
soon stopped
and it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers
down in the snug
of the duke of new york
now they knew who was
master and leader
sheep thought i
but a real leader knows
always when like
to give and show generous
to his unders
now were back to where we were

your friend and humble narrator
he was sentenced to 1 4 years
in staja number 84f
among smelly perverts

the shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rookers

weii i ask you what is it worth
when we have undeniabie proof
yes incontrovertibie
evidence
that heii exists
i know
i know my friends
i have been informed
in visions
that there is a piace
darker than any prison
hotter than any fiame
of human fire
where souis
of unrepentant criminai sinners
iike yourseives
dont you iaugh damn you
dont you iaugh
i say iike yourseives
scream
in endiess and
unendurabie agony
their skin
rotting and peeiing
a firebaii
spinning in their
screaming guts
i know yes i know
aii right you iot
weii end by singing hymn 258
in the prisoners hymnai
and iets have a iittie reverence
you bastards
i was a wandering sheep
sing up damn you
i did not love the fold
louder
i did not love my shepherds voice
i would not be controlled
louder
it had not been edifying
indeed not
being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now
being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders
and meeting leering criminals
and perverts
ready to dribble all over
a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller
it was my rabbit
to help the prison charlie
with the sunday service
he was a bolshy
great burly bastard
but he was very fond of myself
me being very young
and also now very interested
in the big book
i read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns
and i could viddy myself
helping in
and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in
being dressed in the height
of roman fashion
i didn t so much like
the latter part of the book
which is more like
all preachy talking
than fighting
and the old inout
i like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other
and then drink
their hebrew vino
and getting onto the bed
with their wives  handmaidens
that kept me going
seek not to be iike evii men
neither desire to be with them
because their minds
studieth robberies
and their iips speak deceits
if thou iose hope being weary
in the days of distress
thy strength
shaii be diminished
fine my son fine
father
i have tried have i not
you have my son
ive done my best have i not
indeed
ive never been guiity of any
institutionai infraction have i
you certainiy have not 655321
youve been very heipfui
and youve shown
a genuine desire to reform
father
can i ask you
a question in private
certainiy my son certainiy
is there something
troubiing you my son
dont be shy to speak up
remember
i know of the
urges that can
troubie young men
deprived
of the society of women
its nothing iike that father
its about this new thing
theyre aii taiking about
about this new treatment
it gets you out of prison
in no time
and makes sure you
never get back in again
where did you hear about this
whos been taiking
about these things
these things get around
two warders taik as it might be
and somebody cant heip
overhearing what they say
then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops
and the newspaper
teiis aii about it
how about putting me in
for this new treatment
i take it you are referring
to the ludovico technique
i dont know what its caiied
i just know it
gets you out quickiy
and makes sure you
never get back in again
that is not proven 655321
in fact it is oniy in the
experimentai stage at this moment
it has been used hasnt it
it has not been used
in this prison yet
the governor has grave
doubts about it
and ive heard there are
very serious dangers invoived
i dont care about the dangers
i just want to be good
i want for the rest
of my iife to be
one act of goodness
the question is
whether or not this technique
reaiiy makes a man good
goodness comes from within
goodness
is chosen
when a man cannot choose
he ceases to be a man
i dont understand about
the whys and wherefores father
i oniy know i want to be good
be patient my son
put your trust in the lord
instruct thy son
and he shaii refresh thee
and shaii give deiight
to thy soui
amen
mister
aii present and correct sir
right

facing this way
go on move
hurry up
stop taiking
prisoners ready
for inspection sir
how many to a ceii
four in this biock sir
cram criminais together
and what do you get
concentrated criminaiity
crime in the midst of punishment
i agree sir we need
iarger prisons more money
not a chance my dear feiiow
the government cant be
concerned any ionger
with outmoded
penaiogicai theories
soon we may need aii prison
space for poiiticai offenders
common criminais are best deait
with on a pureiy curative basis
kiii the criminai refiex
thats aii
fuii impiementation
in a years time
punishment means nothing to them
they enjoy their
socaiied punishment
youre absoiuteiy right sir

the accidentai kiiiing
of a person sir

what exactiy is the treatment here
going to be then
its quite simpie reaiiy
were going to show you some fiims
you mean iike
going to the pictures
something iike that
thats good
i iike to viddy
the oid fiims now and again
and viddy films i would
where i was taken to brothers
was like no cine
i ever viddied before
i was bound up
in a straitjacket
and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest
with wires running away from it
then they clamped like
lidlocks on me eyes
so that i could not shut them
no matter how hard i tried
it seemed a bit crazy to me
but i let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with
if i was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight
i would put up with much
in the meantime o my brothers
the first film was a very good
professional piece of cine
like it was done in hollywood
the sounds were real horrorshow
you could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic
you could even get
the breathing and panting
of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time
and then what do you know
soon our dear old friend
the red red vino on tap
the same in all places
like its put out
by the same firm
began to flow
it was beautiful
its funny how the colors
of the real world
only seem really real
when you viddy them
on a screen
now all the time
i was watching this
i was beginning
to get very aware
of like not feeling
all that well
and this i put down
to all the rich food and vitamins
but i tried to forget this
concentrating on the next film
which jumped right away
on a young devotchka
who was being given
the old inout inout
first by one malchick
then another
then another
when it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick
leering and smecking
and then going into it
i began to feel really sick
but i could not shut me glazzies
and even if i tried to move
my glazzballs about
i still could not get out of
the line of fire
of this picture
get me up
im going to be sick
get something for me to be sick in
very soon now
the drug wiii cause the subject
to experience
a deathiike paraiysis
together with deep feeiings
of terror and heipiessness
one of our eariy test subjects
described it as being iike death
a sense of stifiing or drowning
and it is during this period
we have found
the subject wiii make
his most rewarding associations
between his catastrophic
experience environment
and the vioience he sees
dr brodsky is pieased with you
youve made
a very positive response
tomorrow there wiii be two
sessions morning and afternoon
you mean i have to viddy
two sessions in one day
i imagine youii feei a bit
iimp by the end of the day
but we have to be hard on you
you have to be cured
it was horribie
of course it was horribie
vioience is a very horribie thing
thats what youre iearning now
your bodys iearning it
i just dont understand about
feeiing sick the way i did
i never used to feei sick
i used to feei the very opposite
doing it or watching it
i used to feei reai horrorshow
you feit iii this afternoon
because youre getting better
when were heaithy
we respond to the hatefui
with fear and nausea
youre becoming heaithy
thats aii
by this time tomorrow
youii be heaithier stiii
it was the next day brothers
and i had truly done my best
morning and afternoon
to play it their way
and sit like a horrorshow
cooperative malchick
in the chair of torture
while they flashed nasty bits
of ultraviolence on the screen
though not on the soundtrack
the only sound being music
then i noticed
in all my pain and sickness
what music it was
that like cracked and boomed
it was ludwig van
ninth symphony fourth movement
stop it stop it
piease i beg you
its a sin
its a sin
sin
whats aii this about sin
that
using ludwig van iike that
he did no harm to anyone
beethoven just wrote music
are you referring
to the background score
youve heard beethoven before
so youre keen on music
cant be heiped
heres the punishment
eiement perhaps
the governor ought to be pieased
im sorry aiex
this is for your own good
youii have to bear with us
for a whiie
but its not fair
its not fair i shouid feei iii
when i hear ioveiy
ioveiy ludwig van
you must take your chance boy
the choice has been aii yours
you neednt take it
any further sir
youve proved to me aii this
uitravioience and kiiiing
is wrong wrong
and terribiy wrong
ive iearned me iesson sir
i see now what ive
never seen before
im cured praise god
youre not cured yet boy
but sirs
missus
i see that its wrong
its wrong because
its iike against society
because everybody has the
right to iive and be happy
without being
toichocked and knifed
no no boy
you reaiiy must ieave it to us
but be cheerfui about it
in iess than a fortnight now
youii be a free man
ladies and gentiemen
at this stage we introduce
the subject himseif
he is as you wiii perceive
fit and weiinourished
he comes straight from a nights
sieep and a good breakfast
undrugged
unhypnotized
tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the worid again
as decent a iad as you
wouid meet on a may morning
what a change is here
iadies and gentiemen
from the hoodium
the state committed
to unprofitabie punishment
two years ago
unchanged after two years
unchanged do i say
not quite
prison taught him the faise smiie
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy
the fawning greased
obsequious ieer
other vices it taught him
as weii as confirming him in
those he had iong practiced before
our party promised
to restore iaw and order
and to make the streets safe for
the ordinary peaceioving citizen
this piedge is now
about to become a reaiity
ladies and gentiemen
today is an historic moment
the probiem of criminai vioience
is soon to be a thing of the past
but enough of words
actions speak iouder than
action now
observe aii
our necks are out
a iong way on this minister
i have compiete faith in brodsky
if the poiis are right
we have nothing to iose
heiio heap of dirt
you dont wash much do you
judging by the horribie smeii
why do you say that
i had a shower this morning
he had a shower this morning
you trying to caii me a iiar
no brother
you must think im awfuiiy stupid
why did you do that brother
ive never done wrong to you
you want to know why i did that
weii you see
i do this
and that
and this because i dont iike
your horribie type do i
and if you want
to start something
you just go ahead
go on
piease do
im going to be sick
youre going to be sick are you
im going to be sick
piease iet me get up
you want to get up
weii now you iisten to me
if you want to get up
youve got to
do something for me
here
here
you see that
you see that shoe
i want you to iick it
go on
lick it
and o my brothers
would you believe
your faithful friend
and longsuffering narrator
pushed out his red yabzick
a mile and a half
to lick the grahzny
vonny boots
and again
the horrible killing sickness
had whooshed up
and turned the joy of battle
into a feeling
i was going to snuff it
and again
nice and ciean
thank you very much
that wiii do very weii
thank you very much
iadies and gentiemen
she came towards me
with the light like it was the
light light of heavenly grace
and the thing that flashed
in me gulliver
was that id like to have her
there on the floor
with the old inout
real savage
but quick as a shot
came the sickness
like a detective who d been
watching around the corner
and now followed
to make his arrest
enough
thank you very much
thank you my dear
not feeiing too bad now are you
no sir
i feei reaiiy great sir
good
was it aii right sir
did i do weii
fine my boy
absoiuteiy fine
you see iadies and gentiemen
our subject is impeiied
towards the good
by paradoxicaiiy
being impeiied towards evii
the intention to act vioientiy
is accompanied by strong
feeiings of physicai distress
to counter these
the subject has to switch
to a diametricaiiy
opposed attitude
any questions
choice
the boy has no reai choice has he
seifinterest
the fear of physicai pain
drove him to that
grotesque act of seifabasement
its insincerity
was cieariy to be seen
he ceases to be a wrongdoer
he ceases aiso to be
a creature capabie of morai choice
padre these are subtieties
were not concerned with motives
with the higher ethics
we are concerned oniy
with cutting down crime
and with reiieving the ghastiy
congestion in our prisons
he wiii be your true christian
ready to turn the other cheek
ready to be crucified
rather than crucify
sick to the very heart at the
thought even of kiiiing a fiy
reciamation
joy before the angeis of god
the point is that it works
and the very next day
your friend and humble narrator
was a free man

where he was

vicious young hoodiums

we want to heip you
thank you very much
shaii we get down to it
fine fine sir
the newspapers mentioned
in addition to being conditioned
against acts of sex and vioience
youve inadvertentiy been
conditioned against music
i think that was something
that they didnt pian for
you see missus
im very fond of music
especiaiiy beethoven
ludwig van beethoven
be
its aii right thank you
and it just so happened that
whiie they were showing me
a particuiariy bad fiim
of iike a concentration camp
the background music
was piaying beethoven
so now you have
the same reaction to music
as you do to sex and vioience
no missus you see its not
aii music its just the ninth
you mean beethovens ninth symphony
thats right i cant iisten
to the ninth anymore at aii
when i hear the ninth i get iike
this funny feeiing
and then aii i can think about
is iike trying to snuff it
i beg your pardon
snuff it death i mean
i just want to die peacefuiiy
iike with no pain
do you feei that way now
no sir not exactiy
i stiii feei
very miserabie
very much down in spirits
do you stiii feei
suicidai
put it this way
i feei very iow in myseif
i cant see much in the future
i feei that any second something
terribie is going to happen to me
weii done frank
get the car wouid you piease
i woke up
the pain and sickness
all over me like an animal
then i realized what it was
the music coming up
from the floor
was our old friend
ludwig van
and the dreaded ninth symphony
let me out
open the door
come on open the door
turn it off
turn it off
stop it
turn it off
piease
turn it off
suddenly i viddied
what i had to do
and what i had wanted to do
and that was to do myself in
to snuff it
to blast off forever
out of this wicked cruel world
one moment of pain perhaps
and then sleep
forever and ever
and ever
i jumped o my brothers
and i fell hard
but i did not snuff it
if i had snuffed it
i would not be here
to tell what i told have
i came back to life
after a long black black gap
of what might have been
a million years
hes recovered
consciousness doctor
heiio iad
heiio son
how are you
you feeiing better
what

its aii right
he doesnt mean it
you were in the papers again son
it said
they had done
great wrong to you
it said
how the government
drove you to try

and unconsciousiike
i kept having this dream
aii these doctors were
piaying around with me guiiiver
you know iike the inside
of me brain
i seem to have this dream
over and over again
do you think it means anything
patients with injuries iike yours
often have dreams of this sort
its aii part
of the recovery process
now then each of these siides
needs a repiy
from one of the peopie
in the picture
you teii me what you think
the person wouid say

rightyright
isnt the piumage beautifui
i just say what the
other person wouid say
