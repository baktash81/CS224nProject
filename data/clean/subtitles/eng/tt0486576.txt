and mysterious power outages
crippled the western united states
but the big story today
the muchanticipated wedding
of fantastic couple
reed richards and susan storm
will take place this saturday
unbelievable bizarre anomalies
are occurring all over the world
defying every law of physics
and all the media care about
is what china pattern we picked
what did you pick the blue ones
with them little flowers l like them
excuse me would you mind
lts happening again isnt it
yeah sure
no were not postponing
anything not this time
this will be the wedding you dreamed of
l wont let anything get in the way
not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level
thats the most romantic thing
youve ever said to me
which is really pathetic
when you think about it
dr richards lm very sorry
but were overbooked
we do have seats available in coach
okay here we go
smile
awesome
look mom
let me get one more
that should be fine
thats my seat
sorry
excuse me
what if we get an endorsement
from an airline get us a private jet
l think we have enough
endorsement deals
thats funny seriously reed it could
help subsidize your little inventions
no thanks
excuse me
consider it talk to you later
where are you going
l dont fly coach
l hope it rains
the snowfall came with no warning
and covered the pyramids
in 2 inches of snow
in japan some suggest
the solidification of the bay
was due to underwater
volcanic activity
though no such activity
has been reported in the area
scientists have ruled out
global warming
as the cause of the climatic events
being reported around the globe
with scientists unable
to explain the events
some are wondering
if the hand of god is at work
in other news reed richards
and susan storms wedding
has manhattan all abuzz
the guest list includes
many of new yorks power elite
hey honey
the citys charging us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed
during that armoredcar robbery
l only remember two cars getting thrown
reed
all right lm putting it away
you were saying
l have a fitting in half an hour
the musicians after that
l havent picked out the place settings
or the flowers theres too much to do
dont worry about it between
the two of us well get it all done
and what were you doing
when l walked in
lnputting my todo list
really
scouts honor
hey guys
new uniforms showed up
what do you think
l think theres no way
were wearing that
what do you have against capitalism
whats this
just a little hobby of mine
yeah
would it make a good toy
or is it something sciencey
a little of both
lm both impressed
and disgusted at that
yeah sue says lm addicted to it
l wonder why shed say that
hey johnny
keep it quiet but lve crossreferenced
and analyzed the global disturbances
theyre caused by cosmic radiation not
unlike the kind which gave us our powers
wow thats really boring
listen l have a very important
wedding issue we need to talk about
yeah of course
your bachelor party
no seriously johnny
john focustesting showed johnny
skewed a little young
seriously johnny no bachelor party
lts just not my kind of thing
then do it for ben lt means a lot
to the big guy youll break his heart
he does have some
sort of rocklike heart
l have too much to do
before the wedding
l think sue might have
a problem with it
you know what sue
would have a problem with
lf somebody told her
you were investigating
global disturbances
and cosmic radiation
instead of focusing on the wedding
like you promised
a bachelor party could be fun
yes
but no exotic dancers
this is it
l dont know anybody here
l would have invited your friends
but you dont have any
hey
johnny we had a deal
theyre not exotic dancers
theyre just hot
youre mr fantastic arent you
thats so awesome
wow youre really cute
lll need a pitcher with
the biggest handle youve got
no problem
good evening

ms storm will be with your shortly
hello
thanks roberta

were here to see dr richards
hes not here can l help you
yes you can take me
to see dr richards
okay
sorry
when the universe began it was
no bigger than a marble then bang
lt exploded
and in a trillionth of a second
it expanded exponentially into
what became the universe we know
wow youre really smart
thanks candy
that means a lot to me
l love this song wanna dance
no l dont
yes you do
honestly
come on youll be great
l dont want to embarrass you guys
just loosen up have some fun
thats it
yeah
thats it
guy really knows how to loosen up
youre not kidding
there he is
yes
unfortunately
for him
shall we
l think it might be clobbering time
sue what are you
general hager
lets talk somewhere private
unless you need to do jello shots
off someones stomach
l was explaining to the girls
about how the big bang led to
this was johnnys idea
l just went along
how does reed know the general
a few years back the guy was pushing
a new missiledefense system
reed testified that the
technology wouldnt work
lm here on direct orders from
the joint chiefs of staff
personally l dont like sharing
sensitive information with a civilian
especially one who enjoys
the public spotlight so much
always a pleasure
to see you too general
what can l do for you
as you may know thereve
been unusual occurrences
officially weve downplayed their
significance but were concerned
these anomalies might pose a
credible threat to our national security
these were taken by one of our
spy satellites three days ago
what is it
we hoped dr richards could tell us
lm afraid lve never
seen anything like it ben
l would say that it was a meteor
but the trails all wrong
lts giving off its own energy
take a look at this
these have been appearing in
remote areas throughout the world
field personnel estimate its diameter
to be 200 meters
to find out what this is about we need
a way to locate and intercept that object
a sensor could be tied into
the baxter buildings satellite grid
we can pinpoint the location
of the object
good youll build the sensor for us
lm afraid l cant
what
lm getting married this saturday
l just dont have the time
richards your country
needs your help
call professor jeff wagner
hes head of the
physics department at brown
l expected more richards
even from you
john storm
fantastic four lncorporated
ever done any modeling
not interested
you got an amazing complexion
not interested
wow and you just walked away
l was definitely still talking
l cant believe you just turned down
a science project
they can build a sensor without me
the most important thing right now
is our wedding
no postponements no interruptions
thank you
and look about what you saw
back at the bar

lm glad you had fun
thank you

oh no not at all
did you follow the shiny man to
lollipop land or the rainbow junction
l know what l saw
thank you lts all right johnny
whatever this thing is it has the ability
to convert matter and energy
so it caused the anomalies
lt seems to radiate cosmic energy
when it exerts itself
randomly affecting matter
evidently this entity this
silver surfer
didnt want to be detected
lt destroyed the sensor
lt knew it was being monitored
and traced it back here
were dealing with something
highly resourceful
are you feeling okay
yeah l just l gotta walk this off
we must destroy it
before it attacks again
richards find me
another way to track it
sue l am so sorry
l didnt tell you because l
didnt want you to worry
lm not mad you built the sensor
you did the right thing
oh great
l wasnt finished
okay sorry please continue
this proves what lve been saying

even our wedding
turns into world war lll
l know but once we are married
everything will be back to normal

how could we possibly
raise a family like this
lm gonna go check on johnny
johnny

all of sues results are normal
but johnnys
johnnys are what
your encounter with the surfer put your
molecules in a constant state of flux
ls that bad
lt caused you to temporarily
switch powers with sue
ld like to run more tests and
want a volunteer
no no hey
no no no
no no hey this is serious
l just wanted to give him a hug
we dont know the extent
of his condition

oh no no no
crap
thats not funny what am l
supposed to do in the meantime
just try to keep
your distance from us
you and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together pal
my inside sources tell me
unlucky bridetobe sue storm
turned invisible
and is staying that way
after yesterdays
embarrassing fiasco
next the invisible womans
greatest fashion blunders
and an impromptu dance routine
from former scientist reed richards
why do you keep watching this
just ignore it
l cant ignore it reed
theres no getting away from it
l believe there is
how
see no answer
yes there is
what if after this crisis is over
we leave it all behind
what are you talking about
we move out of the baxter building
lll take a teaching position
somewhere
get back to my research
the two of us will live our lives
and raise a family like normal people
you would do that
nothing is more important to me
than our future together
oh thank you
what about ben and johnny
theyll understand
besides johnnys always
been more of a solo act
lets not mention it to them yet
johnnys got enough to worry about
as it is with his power problems
youve been busy my friend
your talents are impressive
can you understand what lm saying
together we could be unstoppable
anything would be ours for the taking
all that you know is at an end
what do you mean by that
wait l said wait
theyre breaking up the team
reed and sue l overheard them
they want a nice normal
boringass life
no more fantastic four
well
what do we do
keep going just the two of us
and call ourselves what
the dynamic duo
when were they gonna tell us
theyll tell you when theyre ready
lts their decision not yours
you cant be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy
guys
weve got a serious problem
l crossreferenced the surfers radiation
through every astronomical database
altair 7 rigel 3 vega 6
hes been to all these planets
and now theyre lifeless
barren some even shattered
everywhere the surfer goes
eight days later the planet dies
how are we gonna stop him
we dont even know where he is
what about the craters
they appear in a numerical sequence
the last crater was formed
in greenland
so the next in the sequence
should be
latitude 51 degrees
30 minutes north
longitude zero degrees
seven minutes west
when he surfaces move the fight
away from the crowd
hes too fast to contain
when l see silver lm hitting him
you cant do that we stick to the plan
and work as a team
oh were a team now
news to me
what are you talking about
you know what
we were gonna tell you
when when you moved our stuff out
johnny this isnt a good time
kids got a point reed
you should have told us
thats enough
well talk about this later
what the hell is wrong
with you people
lts a whirlpool
oh my god
what is that
get out get out
dont let go
move
come on go
no johnny
guys what are you doing
ben lift it higher
lll try
sue
stay back
before you get somebody killed
oh my god
what the hell was that
well make adjustments
next time well be ready
next time theres no next time
you cant handle this alone
lm bringing in help
bringing in soldiers and weaponry
will put innocent people in danger
no more than you already have
victor
whats the matter
afraid of ghosts
look out
dont move
since youre a ghost
you wont mind if l break your neck
let him go
you know who that is
victor von doom
hes here under my orders
ben let him go
how is this possible
how are you still alive
no thanks to you four
thats for certain
von dooms made contact with the
alien hes got valuable information
lnformation that might just
help save the planet
now lets be clear about this
shall we l hate you
all of you
but the worlds at stake and we
need to work together to survive
general we know firsthand you trust
victor and youre gonna regret it
so far the only one lve regretted
trusting here is you richards
reed dont agree to this
lets see what hes got
l made a detailed recording
of our little encounter
all that you know is at an end
well
l like the part where
he knocks you on your ass
look at where the energy levels surge
when he attacks me
there see what happened
the energy was channeled through him
but it originated from his board
lf we can separate him from the board
we can cut off his power completely
thats what we have to do
how
lf l knew that
l wouldnt need you people would l
you two should
get started right away
lm glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again
lll try to talk slowly
so you can keep up
how can we be working
on the same side as victor
you got me things were simpler
when l could just whale on the guy
whats he doing a fire
look at that
lll pay for that
lll tell you ben lm starting
to feel like a complete screwup
hey hey youre not
a complete screwup
thank you
look kid its out of our hands
lts up to the eggheads now
you think reeds right about
the whole endoftheworld thing
hes never been wrong
about this kind of thing before
you know lm not exactly
a deep kind of guy
really
but if reeds right and this is it
how do you want
to spend your last few minutes
part of me would like
to go out fighting
but the truth is
ld like to spend my last
couple of minutes holding alicia
that sounds pretty good
l mean not the holding alicia thing
shes your girlfriend not mine
want nothing to do with her
not to say shes not attractive
shes very attractive
shes so attractive
even with the l cant think of
a guy that wouldnt want to
what l meant
was that its nice
to have somebody
well you got me pal
hows it going
l cant find a link
ltll be all right
no it wont
the whole worlds
counting on me and l just
reed youre gonna find the answer
you always do
thanks sue
you just need to relax
yeah right
you do reed you need to relax
take a deep breath
slower
there you go
come on again
see l can already
feel your pulse slowing down
do you remember that time
a pulse
a tachyon pulse
l love you
lm glad l could help
so exactly how does this thing work
when we activate the field
itll separate him from his board
making him powerless
like a fish in a net
yeah
yeah
ln theory anyway
how long until its operational
three hours
three hours
l can only go so fast
since lm working by myself
what do you need to make this happen
there are a couple of things
do your field engineers
have a beryllium casing
what are you doing
dont you knock
youre supposed to be helping reed
tell him not to worry
lll be there to hold his hand
and finish his little project for him
anything else
howd you do it
how did you come back
lt scares you doesnt it
the things l can do
did you know l could create
a force field inside someones body
and expand it until they explode
give it your best shot
just get back to the lab
mr storm
were heading to intercept the surfer
in 1 0 minutes with or without you
were you waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel
that was a joke l was joking
why are you so down on me
you dont even know me
l know you very well
l read your personality profile
confident reckless lrresponsible
selfobsessed
bordering on narcissism
okay so you do know me
all lve seen is a guy
that almost got his team killed
okay
lve been a little off my game lately
this is not a game
sir hes in position north of here
good
general give us a onemile perimeter
forget it richards
you had your shot and you blew it
this is a military operation now
jam the signal get out of the way
and let us do our job
you dont understand
no you dont understand
so let me make it clear for you
and your pack of freaks
lm the quarterback
youre on my team
got it
but l guess you never played football
in high school did you richards
no youre right l didnt
l stayed in and studied
like a good little nerd
and fifteen years later
lm one of the greatest minds
of the 21 st century
lm engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet
and the jock who played quarterback
in high school
is right in front of me
asking me for my help
and l say hes not gonna
get a damn thing
unless he does exactly
what l tell him to
and starts treating my friends
and me with some respect
give him what he wants
l am so hot for you right now
me too
this is it
you have your coordinates set up
your posts and rendezvous back here
first squad move out
hey you scared me there smokey
look at you youre cute
yeah thats right
keep running boo boo
overgrown furball
whats our status
yeah im good to go
same here
almost there
guys
we have a problem
whats wrong
hes here
get out of there right now
why are you destroying our planet
l have no choice
sue
wait
what do you mean
you dont have a choice
theres always a choice
not always
why are you trying to destroy us
l am not the destroyer
come on richards
jam the damn signal
maybe he needs a little persuasion
fire one over the top
roger out
open fire
open fire
open fire repeat open fire
fall back fall back
let me just
no wait
reed
come on sue
all right its up
reed
got him
not so tough now are you
victor stay back
youre the quarterback
eyes on
keep your weapons trained
perimeter secure
move him out
open the gate
get him to the debriefing room
we had an agreement
calm down
the enemy has been captured
where is he
contained
general
mr sherman
lf youll excuse us
we have work to do
l want to be there for the questioning
not gonna happen
make sure our guests remain here
comfortably
yes sir
general what about the board
lts in a chamber which
continuously scrambles the signal
there are certain things
lm not permitted to do
because theyre considered
humanrights violations
fortunately youre not human
are we prisoners
how did that happen
apparently they dont want us
interfering with their methods
l cant imagine what
theyre doing to him
l say he gets what he deserves
how can you say that
lm just saying maybe
the generals right about this
the guy was about to destroy
the planet he said so himself
lt doesnt make sense he protected me
from the missile why would he do that
maybe he thinks youre cute
theres more going on
he said he wasnt the destroyer
maybe he lied
we need to get inside there
and talk to him
but under the radar
ls there any way
we could get some dvds
or popcorn or something
lll call it in
great
thank you semper fi
thats the marine corps
were the army
right l know its the army
captain raye access granted
general
von doom wants to speak with you
you should really be
a little more cooperative
mr sherman lets take a break
l know you are there
whats your name
come on you must have a name
lm susan
you said you werent the one trying
to destroy our world then who is
the one l serve
who do you serve
lm trying to help you but to do that
you have to tell me the truth
please
lt is known by many names
my people called it
galactus
the devourer of worlds
lt must feed on energy to survive
both thermal
and organic
how can you serve this thing
because l must
doesnt it bother you all the worlds and
innocent people youve helped destroy
my service spares my world
and the one l love
why did you try to protect me
because
you remind me of her
could you stop the destroyer
if you wanted to
lt is not l who draws the destroyer here
lt is the beacon
whats the beacon
the source of my power
your board
take joy in the last few hours
you have left
for he is nearly here
well l helped deliver
the alien to you as promised
now its time to keep
your end of the bargain
you can do your tests on the board
but under armed guard
and in my presence only
absolutely
general hager access granted
the board draws it here
how do you fight something
that eats planets
we have to get to the board
and lead it away from here
well do you think the general
will go for that
hell have no choice
thank you general
but lm afraid
the truth is
sometimes reed is right
what
hey you come here
let me ask you something
nice
crap
