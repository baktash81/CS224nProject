and mysterious power outages   
   crippled the western united states 
but the big story today   
   the much anticipated wedding
of fantastic couple   
   reed richards and susan storm
will take place this saturday 
unbelievable  bizarre anomalies   
   are occurring all over the world 
defying every law of physics   
   and all the media care about
is what china pattern we picked 
what did you pick  the blue ones
with them little flowers  l like them 
excuse me  would you mind 
 lt s happening again  isn t it 
 yeah  sure 
no  we re not postponing
anything  not this time 
this will be the wedding you dreamed of 
l won t let anything get in the way 
not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level 
that s the most romantic thing
you ve ever said to me 
which is really pathetic 
when you think about it 
dr  richards  l m very sorry 
but we re overbooked 
 we do have seats available in coach 
 okay  here we go 
 smile 
 awesome 
look  mom 
 let me get one more 
 that should be fine 
that s my seat 
sorry 
excuse me 
what if we get an endorsement
from an airline  get us a private jet 
l think we have enough
endorsement deals 
that s funny  seriously  reed  it could
help subsidize your little inventions 
 no  thanks 
 excuse me 
 consider it  talk to you later 
 where are you going 
l don t fly coach 
l hope it rains 
the snowfall came with no warning   
   and covered the pyramids
in 2 inches of snow 
in japan  some suggest
the solidification of the bay   
   was due to underwater
volcanic activity   
   though no such activity
has been reported in the area 
scientists have ruled out
global warming   
   as the cause of the climatic events
being reported around the globe 
with scientists unable
to explain the events   
   some are wondering
if the hand of god is at work 
in other news  reed richards
and susan storm s wedding   
   has manhattan all abuzz 
the guest list includes
many of new york s power elite 
hey  honey 
the city s charging us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed   
   during that armored car robbery 
l only remember two cars getting thrown 
reed 
all right  l m putting it away 
you were saying 
l have a fitting in half an hour 
the musicians after that 
l haven t picked out the place settings
or the flowers  there s too much to do 
don t worry about it  between
the two of us  we ll get it all done 
and what were you doing
when l walked in 
 lnputting my to do list 
 really 
 scout s honor 
 hey  guys 
new uniforms showed up 
what do you think 
l think there s no way
we re wearing that 
what do you have against capitalism 
what s this 
 just a little hobby of mine 
 yeah 
would it make a good toy 
or is it something science y 
a little of both 
l m both impressed
and disgusted at that 
yeah  sue says l m addicted to it 
l wonder why she d say that 
hey  johnny 
keep it quiet  but l ve cross referenced
and analyzed the global disturbances 
they re caused by cosmic radiation  not
unlike the kind which gave us our powers 
wow  that s really boring 
listen  l have a very important
wedding issue we need to talk about 
yeah  of course 
your bachelor party 
no  seriously  johnny 
john  focus testing showed johnny
skewed a little young 
seriously  johnny  no bachelor party 
lt s just not my kind of thing 
then do it for ben  lt means a lot
to the big guy  you ll break his heart 
he does have some
sort of rocklike heart 
l have too much to do
before the wedding 
l think sue might have
a problem with it 
you know what sue
would have a problem with 
lf somebody told her
you were investigating   
   global disturbances
and cosmic radiation   
   instead of focusing on the wedding 
like you promised 
 a bachelor party could be fun 
 yes 
but no exotic dancers 
 this is it 
 l don t know anybody here 
l would have invited your friends 
but you don t have any 
hey 
johnny  we had a deal 
they re not exotic dancers 
they re just hot 
you re mr  fantastic  aren t you 
that s so awesome 
wow  you re really cute 
l ll need a pitcher with
the biggest handle you ve got 
no problem 
good evening 
and welcome to the baxter    
could l help you 
no  you can t use that elev  
ms  storm will be with your shortly 
hello 
thanks  roberta 
may l help you 
 we re here to see dr  richards 
 he s not here  can l help you 
yes  you can take me
to see dr  richards 
okay 
sorry 
when the universe began  it was
no bigger than a marble  then  bang 
lt exploded 
and in a trillionth of a second   
   it expanded exponentially into
what became the universe we know 
wow  you re really smart 
thanks  candy 
that means a lot to me 
l love this song  wanna dance 
 no  l don t 
 yes  you do 
 honestly 
 come on  you ll be great 
l don t want to embarrass you guys 
just loosen up  have some fun 
that s it 
yeah 
that s it 
 guy really knows how to loosen up 
 you re not kidding 
there he is 
yes 
unfortunately 
for him 
shall we 
l think it might be clobbering time 
sue  what are you    
general hager 
let s talk somewhere private 
unless you need to do jell o shots
off someone s stomach 
l was explaining to the girls
about how the big bang led to    
this was johnny s idea 
l just went along 
how does reed know the general 
a few years back  the guy was pushing
a new missile defense system 
reed testified that the
technology wouldn t work 
l m here on direct orders from
the joint chiefs of staff 
personally  l don t like sharing
sensitive information with a civilian 
especially one who enjoys
the public spotlight so much 
always a pleasure
to see you too  general 
what can l do for you 
as you may know  there ve
been unusual occurrences 
officially  we ve downplayed their
significance  but we re concerned   
   these anomalies might pose a
credible threat to our national security 
these were taken by one of our
spy satellites three days ago 
 what is it 
 we hoped dr  richards could tell us 
l m afraid l ve never
seen anything like it  ben 
l would say that it was a meteor 
but the trail s all wrong 
lt s giving off its own energy 
take a look at this 
these have been appearing in
remote areas throughout the world 
field personnel estimate its diameter
to be 200 meters 
to find out what this is about  we need
a way to locate and intercept that object 
a sensor could be tied into
the baxter building s satellite grid 
we can pinpoint the location
of the object 
 good  you ll build the sensor for us  
 l m afraid l can t 
what 
l m getting married this saturday 
l just don t have the time 
richards  your country
needs your help 
call professor jeff wagner 
he s head of the
physics department at brown 
l expected more  richards 
even from you 
john storm 
fantastic four lncorporated 
 ever done any modeling 
 not interested 
 you got an amazing complexion 
 not interested 
wow  and you just walked away 
l was definitely still talking 
l can t believe you just turned down
a science project 
they can build a sensor without me 
the most important thing right now
is our wedding 
no postponements  no interruptions 
thank you 
and  look  about what you saw
back at the bar    
don t worry about it  l know you 
l m glad you had fun

l did at my bachelorette party 
talk about wild 
wild 
come on 
hey  what are you doing up here 
nothing  just needed some air 
you re making that thing
for the general  aren t you

don t worry  my lips are sealed 
that is  they would be if l had any 
look  don t tell johnny 
 don t tell johnny what

lf sue finds out  you ll get
an invisible kick in the nuts 
 hey  hey  we re keeping this quiet

dearly beloved  we are gathered

   reed richards and susan storm 
together   
   in the bond of holy   
   matrimony 
l can t believe you

l know  but there s a good reason 
 we have to do this quickly 
 that s romantic 
 should l continue 
 yes  please 
 there are many kinds of love 
 could you skip to the end  please 
 reed 
 excuse me 
 what happened

 l m trying  l m trying 
ben 
 johnny

okay  you win 
flame on  come on 
flame on 
hey 
your herald summons you 
another world awaits 
let it be done quickly 
lt looked like a man  but completely
covered in silver  and it flew this  like   
   surfboard type thing 
l know that sounds crazy 
oh  no  not at all 
did you follow the shiny man to
lollipop land or the rainbow junction 
 l know what l saw 
 thank you  lt s all right  johnny 
whatever this thing is  it has the ability
to convert matter and energy 
so it caused the anomalies 
lt seems to radiate cosmic energy
when it exerts itself   
   randomly affecting matter 
evidently  this entity  this   
   silver surfer   
   didn t want to be detected 
lt destroyed the sensor 
 lt knew it was being monitored 
 and traced it back here 
we re dealing with something
highly resourceful 
are you feeling okay 
yeah  l just     l gotta walk this off 
we must destroy it
before it attacks again 
richards  find me
another way to track it 
sue  l am so sorry 
l didn t tell you  because l
didn t want you to worry 
l m not mad you built the sensor 
you did the right thing 
oh  great 
l wasn t finished 
okay  sorry  please continue 
this proves what l ve been saying 
could you drop the force field 
we can t even   sorry 
even our wedding
turns into world war lll 
l know  but once we are married 
everything will be back to normal 
we will never have normal lives
as long as we do what we do 
how could we possibly
raise a family like this 
l m gonna go check on johnny 
johnny 
hey  are you all right  pal 
are you all right 
johnny 
johnny  are you okay 
l don t know  l ve been feeling really
strange since my run in with surfer boy 
maybe we should get you checked out 
 why did you do that 
 l didn t do anything 
stop  drop and roll 
stop  drop and roll 
oh  my god  sue  just  
just hang on  l ll get you  okay 
flame on

 sue  how did this happen 
l touched johnny  and then this 
 where is johnny 
 here

 nice 
 there you go 
hey  get out of there 
sue  your clothes 
why does this always happen to me 
all of sue s results are normal 
but johnny s    
johnny s are what 
your encounter with the surfer put your
molecules in a constant state of flux 
ls that bad 
lt caused you to temporarily
switch powers with sue 
 l d like to run more tests and  
 want a volunteer 
 no  no  hey 
 no  no  no 
no  no  hey  this is serious 
l just wanted to give him a hug 
we don t know the extent
of his condition 
lt could be progressive 
 lt could be fun 
 no  ben 
ben 
hey  hey  it s me  l m back 
oh  my god 
come on 
we just said this is serious 
oh  yeah  serious 
oh  you gotta be kidding me 
 hey  not bad 
 lncredible 
 you better be able to fix this 
 l m right on it 
 ben  stop it 
 l see why you like that 
oh  no  no  no 
crap 
that s not funny  what am l
supposed to do in the meantime 
just try to keep
your distance from us 
you and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together  pal 
my inside sources tell me
unlucky bride to be sue storm   
   turned invisible
and is staying that way   
   after yesterday s
embarrassing fiasco 
next  the invisible woman s
greatest fashion blunders   
   and an impromptu dance routine
from former scientist reed richards 
why do you keep watching this 
just ignore it 
l can t ignore it  reed 
there s no getting away from it 
 l believe there is 
 how 
see  no answer 
yes  there is 
what if  after this crisis is over   
    we leave it all behind 
 what are you talking about 
we move out of the baxter building 
l ll take a teaching position
somewhere 
get back to my research 
the two of us will live our lives
and raise a family  like normal people 
you would do that 
nothing is more important to me
than our future together 
oh  thank you 
what about ben and johnny 
they ll understand 
besides  johnny s always
been more of a solo act 
let s not mention it to them yet 
johnny s got enough to worry about
as it is  with his power problems 
you ve been busy  my friend 
your talents are impressive 
can you understand what l m saying 
together  we could be unstoppable 
anything would be ours for the taking 
all that you know is at an end 
what do you mean by that 
wait  l said  wait 
they re breaking up the team 
reed and sue  l overheard them 
they want a nice  normal 
boring ass life 
 no more fantastic four 
 well   
   what do we do 
keep going  just the two of us 
and call ourselves what 
the dynamic duo 
when were they gonna tell us 
they ll tell you when they re ready 
lt s their decision  not yours 
you can t be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy 
guys 
we ve got a serious problem 
l cross referenced the surfer s radiation
through every astronomical database 
altair 7  rigel 3  vega 6 
 he s been to all these planets 
 and now they re lifeless 
barren  some even shattered 
everywhere the surfer goes 
eight days later  the planet dies 
how are we gonna stop him 
we don t even know where he is 
what about the craters 
they appear in a numerical sequence 
the last crater was formed
in greenland   
   so the next in the sequence
should be   
   latitude 51 degrees 
30 minutes north   
   longitude zero degrees 
seven minutes west 
when he surfaces  move the fight
away from the crowd 
he s too fast to contain 
when l see silver  l m hitting him 
you can t do that  we stick to the plan
and work as a team 
oh  we re a team now 
news to me 
 what are you talking about 
 you know what 
we were gonna tell you 
 when  when you moved our stuff out 
 johnny  this isn t a good time 
kid s got a point  reed 
you should have told us 
that s enough 
we ll talk about this later 
what the hell is wrong
with you people 
lt s a whirlpool 
oh  my god 
what is that 
get out  get out 
don t let go 
 move 
 come on  go 
no  johnny 
guys  what are you doing 
ben  lift it higher 
l ll try 
sue 
stay back 
before you get somebody killed 
oh  my god 
what the hell was that 
we ll make adjustments 
next time  we ll be ready 
next time  there s no next time 
you can t handle this alone 
l m bringing in help 
bringing in soldiers and weaponry
will put innocent people in danger 
no more than you already have 
victor 
what s the matter 
afraid of ghosts 
 look out 
 don t move 
since you re a ghost 
you won t mind if l break your neck 
 let him go 
 you know who that is 
victor von doom 
he s here under my orders 
ben  let him go 
how is this possible 
how are you still alive 
no thanks to you four 
that s for certain 
von doom s made contact with the
alien  he s got valuable information 
lnformation that might just
help save the planet 
now let s be clear about this   
   shall we  l hate you 
all of you 
but the world s at stake and we
need to work together to survive 
general  we know firsthand  you trust
victor and you re gonna regret it 
so far  the only one l ve regretted
trusting here is you  richards 
reed  don t agree to this 
let s see what he s got 
l made a detailed recording
of our little encounter 
all that you know is at an end 
well 
l like the part where
he knocks you on your ass 
look at where the energy levels surge
when he attacks me 
there  see what happened 
the energy was channeled through him 
but it originated from his board 
lf we can separate him from the board 
we can cut off his power completely 
 that s what we have to do 
 how 
lf l knew that 
l wouldn t need you people  would l 
you two should
get started right away 
l m glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again 
l ll try to talk slowly
so you can keep up 
how can we be working
on the same side as victor 
you got me  things were simpler
when l could just whale on the guy 
what s he doing  a fire 
look at that 
l ll pay for that 
l ll tell you  ben  l m starting
to feel like a complete screw up 
hey  hey  you re not
a complete screw up 
thank you 
look  kid  it s out of our hands 
lt s up to the eggheads now 
you think reed s right about
the whole end of the world thing 
he s never been wrong
about this kind of thing before 
you know  l m not exactly
a deep kind of guy 
really 
but if reed s right  and this is it   
   how do you want
to spend your last few minutes 
part of me would like
to go out fighting 
but the truth is   
   l d like to spend my last
couple of minutes holding alicia 
that sounds pretty good 
l mean  not the   holding alicia   thing 
she s your girlfriend  not mine 
want nothing to do with her 
not to say she s not attractive 
she s very attractive 
she s so attractive 
even with the   l can t think of
a guy that wouldn t want to  
what l meant   
   was that it s nice
to have somebody 
well  you got me  pal 
how s it going 
l can t find a link 
 lt ll be all right 
 no  it won t 
the whole world s
counting on me  and l just    
reed  you re gonna find the answer 
 you always do 
 thanks  sue 
 you just need to relax 
 yeah  right 
you do  reed  you need to relax 
take a deep breath 
slower 
there you go 
come on  again 
see  l can already
feel your pulse slowing down 
 do you remember that time   
 a pulse 
a tachyon pulse 
l love you 
l m glad l could help 
so exactly how does this thing work 
when we activate the field 
it ll separate him from his board   
    making him powerless 
 like a fish in a net 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 ln theory  anyway 
 how long until it s operational 
 three hours 
 three hours 
l can only go so fast 
since l m working by myself 
 what do you need to make this happen 
 there are a couple of things 
do your field engineers
have a beryllium casing 
what are you doing 
 don t you knock 
 you re supposed to be helping reed 
tell him not to worry 
l ll be there to hold his hand
and finish his little project for him 
 anything else 
 how d you do it 
how did you come back 
lt scares you  doesn t it 
the things l can do 
did you know l could create
a force field inside someone s body   
   and expand it until they explode 
give it your best shot 
just get back to the lab 
mr  storm 
we re heading to intercept the surfer
in 1 0 minutes  with or without you 
were you waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel 
that was a joke  l was joking 
why are you so down on me 
you don t even know me 
l know you very well 
l read your personality profile 
confident  reckless  lrresponsible 
self obsessed 
bordering on narcissism 
okay  so you do know me 
all l ve seen is a guy
that almost got his team killed 
okay 
l ve been a little off my game lately 
this is not a game 
 sir  he s in position north of here 
 good 
 general  give us a one mile perimeter 
 forget it  richards 
you had your shot and you blew it 
this is a military operation now 
jam the signal  get out of the way 
and let us do our job 
 you don t understand 
 no  you don t understand 
so let me make it clear for you
and your pack of freaks 
l m the quarterback 
you re on my team 
got it 
but l guess you never played football
in high school  did you  richards 
no  you re right  l didn t 
l stayed in and studied 
like a good little nerd 
and fifteen years later   
   l m one of the greatest minds
of the 21 st century 
l m engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet 
and the jock who played quarterback
in high school   
   is right in front of me 
asking me for my help 
and l say he s not gonna
get a damn thing   
   unless he does exactly
what l tell him to   
   and starts treating my friends
and me with some respect 
give him what he wants 
l am so hot for you right now 
 me too 
this is it 
you have your coordinates  set up
your posts and rendezvous back here 
first squad  move out

you don t have a choice 
there s always a choice 
not always 
why are you trying to destroy us 
l am not the destroyer

 perimeter secure 
 move him out

 calm down 
the enemy has been captured

general 
mr  sherman 
lf you ll excuse us 
we have work to do 
 l want to be there for the questioning 
 not gonna happen 
make sure our guests remain here 
comfortably 
yes  sir 
general  what about the board 
lt s in a chamber which
continuously scrambles the signal 
there are certain things
l m not permitted to do   
   because they re considered
human rights violations 
fortunately  you re not human 
are we prisoners 
how did that happen 
apparently  they don t want us
interfering with their methods 
l can t imagine what
they re doing to him 
 l say he gets what he deserves 
 how can you say that 
l m just saying maybe
the general s right about this 
the guy was about to destroy
the planet  he said so himself 
lt doesn t make sense  he protected me
from the missile  why would he do that 
maybe he thinks you re cute 
there s more going on 
he said he wasn t the destroyer 
maybe he lied 
we need to get inside there
and talk to him 
but under the radar 
ls there any way
we could get some dvds   
   or popcorn or something 
 l ll call it in 
 great 
thank you  semper fi 
that s the marine corps 
we re the army 
right  l know it s the army 
captain raye  access granted 
general 
von doom wants to speak with you 
you should really be
a little more cooperative 
mr  sherman  let s take a break 
l know you are there

come on  you must have a name 
l m susan 
you said you weren t the one trying
to destroy our world  then who is 
 the one l serve

l m trying to help you  but to do that 
you have to tell me the truth 
please 
lt is known by many names 
my people called it   
   galactus   
   the devourer of worlds 
lt must feed on energy to survive 
both thermal   
   and organic 
how can you serve this thing 
because l must 
doesn t it bother you  all the worlds and
innocent people you ve helped destroy 
my service spares my world   
   and the one l love 
why did you try to protect me 
because   
   you remind me of her 
could you stop the destroyer
if you wanted to 
lt is not l who draws the destroyer here 
lt is the beacon 
what s the beacon 
the source of my power 
your board 
take joy in the last few hours
you have left   
   for he is nearly here 
well  l helped deliver
the alien to you  as promised 
now it s time to keep
your end of the bargain 
you can do your tests on the board   
   but under armed guard
and in my presence only 
absolutely 
general hager  access granted 
the board draws it here 
how do you fight something
that eats planets 
we have to get to the board
and lead it away from here 
well  do you think the general
will go for that
