a prologue and an epilogue
you ve been through the epidermis 
derma and muscles 
prologue
julie disappointed herself 
this used to be easy 
she was still among the top students 
but there were too many
interruptions  updates 
feeds 
unsolvable global problems 
she sensed
a gnawing unease
she had tried to suppress by cramming
by drowning it in digital interference 
this was wrong 
this wasn t her 
she d chosen medicine
because it was
so hard to gain admission 
where her excellent grades
actually meant something 
but then she had
a revelation 
her passion had always been the soul 
the mind  not the body 
surgery is like  so concrete 
it s almost like being a carpenter 
but now   
my passion has always been
what goes on inside   thoughts and feelings 
it was like a window had opened 
not anatomy 
if psychology will make you happy 
then do it 
i think you re really brave 
i can t take it anymore 
i don t want to 
she left him 
though he was devastated 
he had to respect
the way she took control of her life 
she observed her fellow students 
norway s future spiritual advisers 
mostly girls with borderline
eating disorders 
say you re at a party 
she still felt trapped in
the role of model student 
all this cramming 
when was life supposed to start 
what s your name 
julie 
the person s name is julie 
let s say julie and i
meet at a party 
and we feel a mutual attraction 
hypothetically 
actually  she was a visual person 
now i know 
i want to be a photographer 
a photographer 
i see 
julie spent her student loan
on cameras and lenses 
as long as you re serious about it 
no safety net  no holding back 
need help 
she took a temp job
in a bookstore 
started a photography course 
super 
she made new friends 
it felt like coming home 
suddenly oslo was a different city 
new places  new faces 
hi  aksel 
right   
you re the comic book artist 
she d heard
he was the creator of bobcat 
sorry  i m a wild animal 
have you read it 
yeah 
so 
she pretended she d read it 
she only remembered one strip
she d found vaguely sexist 
i know what you mean 
nothing s ever good enough 
the only thing worse than
all the idiots is yourself 
but   
if we go on  i ll fall in love with you 
then it ll be too late 
maybe we should agree to   
stop seeing each other 
the problem is our age difference 
i m just afraid we ll fall into
a vicious circle 
you re much younger than i am 
you ll start to question who you are 
i m past 40 
i ve entered a new phase 
whereas you still need time
to find yourself 
you don t need me waiting 
you need to be completely free 
i m just afraid we ll hurt each other 
later she said
that was the precise moment
she fell in love with him 
shall i put your bag in the bedroom 
yes  please 
i have two copies of a book 
huh 
yeah 
i ll throw one away 
can i have two shelves 
how many closets do you need 
how many can i have 
no  that s not how it works 
this is antique glass 
all wavy and stuff 
no  don t do that  not like that 
no 
lift this catch here 
i m terrified it ll break 
i gaze out this window 
  no way 
  i m not kidding 
hey  that s how relationships work 
she s a bit frosty towards me 
that s new 
yeah  why do you think that is 
it s embarrassing to say 
we ve been single together 
lived that life 
then suddenly i move in with you 
  and you re happy 
  yeah 
no  no  no   
did you date this guy 
yeah  just a fling 
okay 
stop 
you re so predictable 
let s just fuck 
hello 
chapter 1
the others
  happy to see you 
  me  too 
  doing good 
  yeah 
hi  martin 
welcome 
thanks for coming 
dad designed it 
we should renovate 
but don t want to change anything 
it s beautiful 
yeah  but there s stuff like that  damp 
we get this room
because we re childless 
dibs on the top bunk 
i always feel that tone doesn t like me 
she s just shy 
that s what you say about boring people 
  it s my turn now 
  okay 
thank you 
vin 
vin de blanc 
thanks 
do you have any friends with kids yet 
no  only one 
guess this feels unfamiliar 
  they re very sweet 
  thanks 
so what are you doing now  julie 
aksel says you ve started writing 
well  i wouldn t exactly
call it writing 
being modest 
no 
seems so 
is there anything you d like to do 
as a career 
questions  questions  karianne 
that question was vulgar
when we were students 
lucky you 
yeah  we were 
true  we had a lot of freedom 
being young today is different 
the pressure is heart breaking 
there s no time to think 
always something on the screen 
take william 
if we don t set limits 
he spends his life on screens 
nice try 
okay 
no  it s not your turn 
it s martin s turn 
julie s still the closest 
bedtime 
  she s exhausted 
  no 
no 
  yes 
  no 
i don t want to go to bed 
i don t want to 
eva  don t make another scene 
come here 
no  i don t want to 
let go 
  you silly girl 
  i don t want to 
but i want you to 
i don t want to 
kids can be intense 
well  it s okay 
  fun with kids 
  yeah 
can t we just enjoy it 
please  no fights 
there are kids here  and it s chaos 
just try 
try playing with them
or something  okay 
please 
spare me the kid talk 
sorry  but i wasn t the one who started 
you re with someone who s
younger than you  there s a gap 
you re almost 30 
not a bad age to have kids 
i m 44  i want to go to the next level 
with you 
it has nothing to do with my friends 
you seem to be waiting for something 
i don t know what 
hello 
jeez 
i didn t want to get into this 
really not 
everything s on your terms 
you have time off 
so we re on holiday 
you agreed 
after you publish  you get bored 
and start talking about kids 
the others here have kids 
so it s an issue 
not true 
it is true 
and then   
you get a new idea at some point 
and disappear into your drawing board 
what are you saying 
don t start  it s not cool 
shut up  please 
of course i d be there if we had kids 
you know that 
you know i want children 
sure  and i ll also want kids
at some point 
but i don t know   
i have no maternal instinct  right 
no  you d make a great mom 
i m sure of it 
i want to have children  too 
at some point 
so what are we waiting for 
what has to happen first 
i don t know what exactly 
i just want to do more first 
okay  like what 
what s the obstacle 
i don t know  why do you ask 
your concept is flawed 
most people have kids without
sorting out their life first 
  they figure it out 
  flawed 
that s how most people do it 
but i don t want everything
to happen on your terms 
based on what you want 
fine  i got it 
but what do you want 
oh  please  we have to stop 
i need sleep
to put up with those people 
i know a guy
who has a theory about that 
he says we have
a limited number of sperm 
say    three trillion in your lifetime 
jerk off too much   
and you run out 
could be true 
easy now  portnoy 
how fascinating 
personally  i feel like
i know everything
about male problems 
erectile dysfunction 
morning wood 
infatuation with young women   
premature ejaculation   
nice work  aksel 
it s in all the books and movies 
where s the menstrual period 
female orgasm and desire  where 
good question  tell us 
in juicy detail 
no  the point is
it shouldn t be taboo 
if men had periods 
that s all we d hear about 
can you womansplain it
a bit better 
what do you mean 
like mansplaining  but womansplaining 
what 
mansplaining is   
when a 45 year old man explains
how things really are
to a younger woman 
nice demonstration 
my pleasure 
ding  great 
whiskey  anyone 
how s the senior citizen club doing 
come on 
look who s here 
are you okay 
not really 
show me 
no 
let me see   
we ll laugh about it later 
it s just a scratch 
karianne s such a drama queen 
it s my fault 
not at all  julie 
it is  i always overdo it 
i know being here isn t easy for you 
i m not into this whole
 happy family  thing either 
i m glad it turned into a party tonight 
i hope you had fun 
what the hell s wrong with you 
what s wrong with having a little fun 
i didn t have any fun 
sorry that happened 
you don t care 
shut up  just shut up 
you don t give a shit about me 
shall we make a baby 
fuck you 
  hi 
  good morning 
there s coffee  and cups 
chapter 2
cheating
sorry  i forgot 
what s your line of work 
i work in a bookstore 
which one 
norli  by the university 
could you excuse me for a moment 
could you sign 
sure  i ll just finish this 
any new bobcat in the pipeline 
i ve moved on 
do you work full time there 
or are you just temping on weekends 
  sorry 
  bye 
hey  i think i ll head home 
okay 
  you good 
  yeah 
  sure 
  yeah  i m fine 
  i can stay if you like 
  it s okay 
  but i have to stay a bit longer 
  of course 
okay  see you at home 
hi  can i have a smoke 
of course 
i had my second child
ten years later 
now we re supposed
to introduce solids at 4 months 
what made the pediatricians
change their minds 
  do you cuddle your kids 
  sure  a lot 
they ll be drug addicts 
they ll be addicts
because i cuddle them 
yeah  according to new research 
new research says
you shouldn t cuddle your kids 
i realize it must be counter intuitive
for a mother 
but motherhood upsets
your limbic system 
so my kids are going to be drug addicts 
that s ridiculous 
do you have children 
no  but i m a doctor 
i have a medical perspective 
babies express themselves by crying 
it s normal for a mother or a father
to comfort them 
hi 
not asking me the usual questions 
  which ones 
  who i am  what i do 
who are you  what do you do 
i hate those questions 
they re especially bad
when you re a doctor 
are you a doctor 
no  you are 
which questions should i ask 
ask me who i know here 
  who do you know here 
  nobody 
i crashed the party 
you just waltzed in 
okay 
nothing s gonna happen 
of course not 
i m with someone i love 
me  too 
and i can t stand cheating 
i ve been there  never again 
  right  cheating is   
  no good 
but where do you draw the line 
you can feel it 
if i do this   
is that cheating 
no 
what about this 
  no  that s permissible 
  is it 
and hurting someone
who s not your partner 
  you hurt your partner 
  is that cheating 
did that hurt 
did it 
  feel good 
  yeah  it did 
okay 
let me smell your sweat 
  no 
  yes 
  seriously 
  yes  that s allowed 
  it stinks 
  yes 
the kind of smell you never forget 
my turn to smell you 
no  please 
i regret it now 
let me smell 
i think you smell nice 
i don t know if   
this is permissible 
go ahead 
okay 
you start 
then i ll go next 
i actually think sex is best
when the dick isn t too hard 
because   
in a way  then i m the one
who makes it hard  you know 
my secret will be dumb now 
i guess i misunderstood 
i was going to say
i like the barcode project 
it looks pretty from the bridge
when i go to work 
i expose my darkest secrets 
and you   
you said  secrets  
not  darkest  
so why is that a secret 
because everyone thinks it s ugly 
sorry  we re   
  can i whisper it 
  okay 
what 
sorry  i seem to
be sitting on everything 
my bad 
there s nothing sexual about that 
not at all 
although you do like soft dicks 
yeah 
okay  your turn 
i can t pee 
just relax 
i m going this way 
okay 
what s your name 
julie 
  i m eivind  eivind   
  don t say it 
why not 
i ll find you on facebook  and   
good thinking 
okay 
  bye 
  bye 
  we didn t cheat 
  no 
  not at all 
  no 
bye 
chapter 3
oral sex in the age of  metoo
aksel 
aksel  i need to tell you something 
aksel 
 a friend told me she had sex
with a man
 who pumped his dick into her mouth
while he held her head 
 she was confused
because she enjoyed it 
 it really turned her on 
 can you be a feminist
and still enjoy being mouth fucked 
 most women i know are ambivalent
about performing oral sex 
 they must act as if they like   
the pathetic expectation
 that it ll turn them on   
 i like it flaccid 
 so i create the stiffness
 instead of having it thrust upon me  
this is good 
  yeah 
  it s over the top 
i don t agree with everything 
but it s very well written 
original  very good 
what will you do with it 
i don t know 
you really think it s good 
yeah  absolutely 
you sure 
yeah  i m not lying 
no 
are you sure 
don t you dare doubt it 
it s pretty cerebral 
but it turns me on too 
  right 
  kinda 
is that why you wrote it 
intellectual viagra 
  yeah 
  it works 
her piece
 oral sex in the age of  metoo 
was published on jubel no 
it was widely shared and set off
a lively facebook debate 
with the strong painkillers i m on 
i can t drive 
chapter 4

clever girl 
when are you coming to see us 
per harald 
we d love it 
come see where your daughter lives 
sure  of course 
but it s hard to park in central oslo 
they ve got that   
resident   
resident parking there 
yeah 
it s made it much easier
to find a space 
you just have to pay 
and move the car every half hour 
is that the reason
you don t come to see us 
because it s hard to drive in town 
that s not it 
then what is it 
well  you know   
with my painkillers 
i m not allowed to drive 
there s that  too 
the good thing is 
he s open about it 
his pains  his prostate 
you have to make your own family 
chapter 5
bad timing
excuse me

they don t have it either 
okay 
we can try at ark 
thank you 
i told her
i forgot my sunglasses 
i just had to say
that i know what we said 
but i think about you a lot 
and   
i don t want to bug you
if you re happy 
are you 
  i don t know what to say 
  say nothing 
i d like to see you again 
just to talk 
i mean  i m not going to   
but i d like to see you again 
just to   
i m at åpent bakeri in barcode
nearly every day 
i work there  i mean 
if you want to 
so   
  eivind 
  yes 
your glasses 
oh  right  fuck 
language opens the door
to the subconscious 
freud was a great writer 
he could be self critical 
he never hesitated
to revise his theories 
he viewed each individual patient
as a research subject 
freud didn t distinguish between
therapy and research 
i find that very compelling 
especially these days 
when scientific methodology
is applied
even in the humanities 
enough about freud 
how s the movie coming along 
isn t it almost done 
yeah  i ve seen it  but   
  you have 
  yes 
it s no longer mine at all 
is it as bad as you feared 
the worst thing is how
they ve housetrained bobcat 
it s all very sanitized and safe 
i ll show you something 
a mock up of the movie poster 
i have to admit   
i m embarrassed my name s on it 
shit 
no  seriously 
you must be kidding  no way 
that s the poster  for real 
let s see 
looks like chip and dale 
holy shit 
should i laugh or cry 
everything was butchered 
the story  all the details 
they removed the starfish 
sorry  i m lost 
what starfish 
it s  you know   
the butthole  the anus 
his butt is smooth in the movie 
this thing is gone 
that s bad in my book 
in underground comics you shit 
you puke  you fuck and all that stuff 
bobcat is a wild cat
in a world of domestic cats 
he s a rebel against the bourgeoisie 
one of the most iconic buttholes ever 
coffee 
yeah 
i don t know what we should do 
i have to go 
aksel 
we need to talk 
yeah  of course 
what s wrong 
julie said she d been thinking 
it wasn t his fault 
nothing he could have changed 
it s not anything you ve done 
it s not your fault  but i feel   
it was about
all their old arguments 
things they both knew 
it was bad timing 
they d met in different phases of life 
they wanted different things 
we want different things 
are you leaving me 
yeah 
i want it to be over 
are you sure you re yourself right now 
what do you mean 
do you realize   
do you realize what you re doing 
what you re destroying 
yes  of course 
that s why it s so hard 
where will you live 
i don t know 
you don t know 
no  with mom 
move home to mom 
yeah  until i find a place 
okay 
no  come on   
it s over 
i ve had it  what else can i say 
is something else bothering you
and you re venting on me 
no 
i ve thought about it for a long time 
it feels right 
have you met someone 
no 
i m so sick of all this  julie 
dammit 
sick to death of it 
but okay 
just leave  if that s what you want 
i ll take a walk while you pack 
julie said he deserved
a more grounded woman 
ready for children 
who was dependable 
didn t flake out every six months 
but i like you flaky 
aksel said he liked her flaky 
that he needed someone like that 
who could draw him out
of his drawing board 
and as for having kids   
he said
he d rather be childless with her
than have kids with anyone else 
you know that s not the only problem 
so what is the problem 
it s a combination of things 
not just that 
i can see you re in a crisis right now 
i can understand that 
but if you love me 
we ll sort it all out 
yes  i do love you 
and i don t love you 
julie felt that this sentence 
the way she said it 
her emphasis on certain words 
summed up the impossibility of it all 
i feel like a spectator in my own life 
like i m playing a supporting role
in my own life 
i get that you feel stuck 
you need a change 
but is this the solution 
this is exactly my point 
i m trying to tell you how i feel 
and you re defining my feelings 
i see what you re doing 
what am i doing 
tell me what i m doing 
shut up  and i ll tell you 
you re acting out the confrontation
you never dared have with your father 
  you re taking it out on me 
  is that so 
what do you know about it 
this is the crux of our relationship 
everything we feel 
we have to put into words 
sometimes  i just want to feel things 
you insist on being so
damn strong all the time 
for you 
being strong
is about formulating things 
if you analyze things
at every psychological level 
you think you re strong 
because i m less analytical 
you think i m weaker 
she said she was terrified
of being alone 
terrified of living without him 
that when she left 
she d be like bambi on the ice 
and that was precisely
why she had to do it 
aksel mumbled soothing words
she didn t hear 
she was thinking about how 
at the age of 30 
she d just compared herself to bambi 
no 
i m pathetic 
no  you re not 
aksel   
hey   
i didn t mean what i said 
it s okay 
i said plenty of things  too 
stay a little longer 
you ll regret it 
i m sure i will 
the saddest thing 
is one day  you ll want kids 
in any case 
you ll have other relationships 
and you ll realize that
what we had was unique 
i know 
you don t  but i do 
i ve had many relationships 
i know how hard it is 
nobody communicates like we do 
laughs like we do 
who knows 
maybe we ll get back together someday 
then and there   
she meant it 
i mean it 
chapter 6
finnmark highlands
  are you cold 
  yeah 
  it looked easier on youtube 
  i told you we should practice 
wait   
this one first 
  are you sure 
  yes  this goes on top 
right  but is it first 
isn t the other one first 
  no  that s the top 
  okay 
eivind turned it into a funny story
he told everyone 
but it touched
something deeper in her 
awoke something in her 
she googled her family name 
her grandfather came
from the far north 
the dna sample
she sent to america confirmed it 
eivind didn t see how
her newfound identity
as 3 1  sami
connected to mind expanding substances
and unrelated exotic rituals 
but tried to be supportive 
as she became increasingly militant 
she saw how climate change
was hurting indigenous people 
inuit starving as seals vanish 
melting ice ruining reindeer pastures 
aborigines dying of skin cancer
from the hole in the ozone 
eivind could forget
about flying to new york 
breathe in  all the way up 
she made them live
more sustainably 
he could always do better 
study the ingredients more closely 
consider the environmental impact
of his purchases 
plastic is killing the oceans 
norwegian cod
was ferried to china and back 
cobalt mining was destroying the congo 
batteries had blood on their hands 
the sum of western guilt
sat beside him on the couch 
went to bed with him at night 
everything was weighed against
the greater cause 
he felt he was betraying sunniva 
betraying the sami people 
felt like the world s worst person 
but couldn t resist 
i forgot my sunglasses inside 
right 
be right back 
chapter 7
a new chapter
eivind didn t want kids either 
climate researchers foresaw
hard times for future generations 
overpopulation was the reason
everything was falling apart 
julie liked how this pessimism
added depth
to his cheerful nature 
but she could tell
he had other reasons too 
eivind s father  like julie s 
tended to forget birthdays 
eivind would often say 
 according to my father s calendar

people die of thirst in chile
because avocados need so much water 
still following sunniva on instagram

i don t mind you following her 
it s not a problem  but   
i don t want to be
the sensible choice
while she s the sexy one 
there s nothing sensible about you 
  i mean   
  yeah 
  the angle of her pelvis   
  it s yoga 
that s not yoga 
it is yoga 
you liked it

  i had to like it 
that s right 
so  that s why   
chapter 8

it s annoying as hell 
you can make a fool of yourself
on the dance floor and still be cool 
so true  i ve noticed that 
when we dance 
you take up all the space 
yeah  but it s also like 
 everyone look at me  
yeah  that s my point 
you re always so mysterious 
you still have your stash 
what s that 
where d you find it 
what is it 
magic mushrooms

thanks for putting up with me 
i love you 
chapter 9
bobcat wrecks xmas
bobcat wrecks xmas
have you read your
old bobcat comics since you grew up 
because in our day and age 
they seem so inappropriate and murky
that we feel almost sick
reading them 
it s unpleasant to realize
you created a character
who gained popularity
at the expense of women 
okay  i get it 
you re saying art should be pleasant 
do you think it s art 
i brought along
some of your early comics 
bobcat is one thing 
but then there s dick wolf dick 
pedo the parrot   
right  i don t really think
this is the right medium to
explain comic book humor 
have you ever considered that
some of your readers
may have been victims
of incest or rape 
do we stop creating
because some people might feel bad 
artists get killed for drawing things
others find offensive  they re shot 
are you comparing mohammed caricatures
with drawings of women with big tits 
or with incest 
what s your point 
well  yes and no 
it s a bit of a cop out
to claim freedom of speech
when people criticize you 
we re discussing your work right now 
so nobody s censoring you 
as a woman  i m upset 
i m offended 
though we re not supposed to say that 
you have a choice 
you don t have to feel offended 
it s not a choice 
this is very generational 
one author cannot be held
solely responsible 
i think art has to be messy and free 
it has to be a bit dangerous
to be fun 
i want art to be a form of therapy
where i can express and work through
all my unacceptable thoughts 
all my darkest impulses 
but you re using your male privilege
to mock people weaker than you 
it s hardly art  or even humor 
sorry  it s not
smart enough to be satire 
but this isn t about me 
like  when i create something 
it s not just me talking 
  i know that much 
  do you 
let s say i draw this interview
as a cartoon 
the comic version of me
might call you a whore 
it doesn t mean i think that 
it could be
a parody of a certain type
of insecure male   
you used the word  whore  
yes  i said  whore  
you re not interested in what i mean 
can t you see
that s crass sexualization 
i think we re on a slippery slope here 
all you post feminists
are so fucking self righteous 
thank you  marthe refstad
and aksel willmann 
the term is  sex worker  now 
by the way 
chapter 10
first person singular
i m happy to help 
long time no see 
  yeah 
  how are you 
okay  and you 
i m good 
do you ever talk to aksel 
is he okay 
yeah  well   
i heard the radio interview 
yeah 
he went a bit far 
he s not doing that well 
did you know he s sick 
aksel 
haven t you heard 
he has cancer 
sorry  i thought you knew 
it spread quickly 
they discovered it too late 
cancer 
pancreatic 
but   
how is he coping 
pretty well  under the circumstances 
but it s hard 
the prognosis
is not good 
it s incurable 
thanks for letting me know 
i thought you knew 
no  i hadn t heard anything 
it s just   
i didn t know 
when did you write this 
have you read it 
i was moving it to paper recycling 
it s very good 
you think 
yeah  it sucked me right in 
it s really  really great 
i mean   
it s like   
what 
well   
i have to say 
it s really nice to read about you 
but it s not about me 
but the christmas scene
is your family  right 
yeah  but it s fiction 
you didn t get that 
i made it up 
okay  it s fiction 
in any case   
  it s good 
  because it s me 
no  because it s nice 
 nice  
yeah  nice  good 
well written 
the way you write
is really great 
like here 
 too many memories overlapping 
blending into a blur  
that resonates with me 
it s well written  truly good 
it s not well written 
what s wrong 
suddenly you re into literature 
what was the last book you read 
  are you okay  what s up 
  why 
you criticize
everything i do these days 
sorry  but going through my trash
is pretty invasive 
  can t you see that 
  relax 
   relax  
  calm down 
relaxing is your specialty 
you don t mind
serving coffee till you re 50 
but i want more 
that s hurtful 
i don t know what to say 
chapter 11
positive
hello 
hey   
have you eaten 
yeah  but i can make pasta if you like 
no  i don t need any if you ve eaten 
oops  sorry 
it started with a backache 
i ve had backaches before 
i didn t worry 
then my skin turned almost golden 
i thought i looked good 
it turned out to be jaundice 
mom said i was born jaundiced 
they put me in a light box 
is it painful 
no  not really 
it s okay 
they block selected
neural pathways with botox 
that s good 
yeah  it keeps me from taking
too many painkillers 
how s your family doing 
fine  i guess 
mom still follows your every move 
and your dad 
i ve basically cut him off 
good 
he can chase me if he likes 
does he 
no  not really 
two coffees 
they thought it was hilarious 
in some circumstances 
morbid humour can be funny 
even anal sex at a bar mitzvah 
it makes me laugh 
but i m an old guy now 
no 
well  you know   
i kind of expected this 
i d given up long before i got sick 
really  i just watch
my favourite old movies over and over 
lynch  the godfather part ii   
how many times can you watch
dog day afternoon 
many times 
you should 
absolutely 
sometimes i listen to music   
i haven t heard before 
but   
it s old as well 
music i didn t know about 
but from when i grew up 
it felt as though i d already given up 
i grew up in an age
without internet and mobile phones 
no  but honestly   
i sound like an old fart 
but i think about it a lot 
the world that i knew   
has disappeared 
for me it was all about going to stores 
record stores 
i d take the tram
to voices record store in grünerløkka 
leaf through
used comics at pretty price 
i can close my eyes and see
the aisles at video nova in majorstua 
i grew up in a time
when culture was passed along
through objects 
they were interesting because
we could live among them 
we could pick them up 
hold them in our hands 
compare them 
a bit like books 
yeah  a bit like books 
that s all i have 
i spent my life doing that 
collecting all that stuff 
comics  books   
and   
i just continued 
even when it stopped giving me
the powerful emotions
i felt in my early 20s 
i continued anyway 
and   
now it s all i have left 
knowledge and memories
of stupid  futile things
nobody cares about 
don t say that 
you ve got the comics you created 
i wish i d had what you had 
to be able to draw
without doubting that you re doing
what you re supposed to do 
i really wish i had that 
yeah  but   
i ve got cancer  i m dying 
of course i m being retrospective 
you said you ve done that for ages 
not for that long 
in recent years  i reached
a point in life when suddenly   
it just happened 
when   
i began to worship what had been 
and now i have nothing else 
i have no future 
i can only look back 
and   
it s not even nostalgia 
it s   
fear of death 
it s because i m scared 
it has nothing to do with art 
i m just trying to process   
i have surgery tomorrow at 9 
i felt i could tell you anything 
you wouldn t judge me 
you re the least
judgemental person i know 
i don t have anyone i can talk to   
the way we used to talk 
can you tell me
what you used to tell me 
i hated hearing it at the time 
but can you tell me   
i ll be a good mother 
are you pregnant 
congratulations 
how do you feel 
good or bad 
i don t know 
i m not sure 
it was an accident 
i must ve been careless 
i mean  clearly i was 
were you really sure 
sure you wanted kids 
i was scared  too 
i had doubts  of course 
but i didn t want to show them 
to keep you from   
i never doubted
you d make a good mother 
i saw that you doubted it 
if i regret one thing 
it s that i never managed
to make you see how wonderful you are 
what are you thinking 
this is hard to hear 
but    will you keep it 
i don t know 
i wasted so much time
worrying about what could go wrong 
but what did go wrong 
was never the things i worried about 
if he s a kind man  then go for it 
with a kind father 
and you as the mother 
everything will be fine 
your voice has stayed in my head 
we still have great conversations 
no way 
about what 
mostly about comics 
eclectic tastes 
same here 
i have imaginary conversations with you 
i m sure i remember things about you
that you ve forgotten 
and the other way round 
yeah  maybe 
when i m gone 
all that stuff about you
will go with me 
may i ask you a question 
had you already met him
when you broke up with me 
yeah 
why didn t you tell me 
i don t know 
i didn t dare 
and now you re breaking up with him 
no  why do you say that 
maybe because you don t seem happy
about the baby 
and that s what you do
when things get tough 
i m glad i m pregnant 
i m sorry 
it s alright 
you were the most important
relationship in my life 
you don t have to say anything 
i know it s not the same for you 
that s normal 
you have many years left to live 
but i know  i feel it 
and i want you to know 
you were the love of my life 
you re a damn good person 
i should ve told you before 
but i couldn t 
i m pregnant 
how long have you known 
i know we don t want kids 
no   
i don t know if i do 
i feel like i never see anything through 
i go from one thing to another 
i need time
to think about all this 
about us 
it s okay 
chapter 12
everything comes to an end
that s where i lived 
we moved there when i was 8 
shall we knock 
no  i don t think so 
what do you remember from here 
i remember these colours 
they were always my reference
when i drew my comics 
these colours 
and i remember
the local drunk 
who was super nice 
i m so tired of pretending
everything is okay 
it sucks being in so much pain 
it sucks 
everything sucks 
and   
i don t want to be a memory for you 
i don t want to be a voice in your head 
i don t want to live on through my art 
i want to live in my flat 
i want to live   
i want to live in my flat with you 
i want to be happy together 
bye 
bye
