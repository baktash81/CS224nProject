a prologue and an epilogue
youve been through the epidermis
derma and muscles
prologue
julie disappointed herself
this used to be easy
she was still among the top students
but there were too many
interruptions updates
feeds
unsolvable global problems
she sensed
a gnawing unease
she had tried to suppress by cramming
by drowning it in digital interference
this was wrong
this wasnt her
shed chosen medicine
because it was
so hard to gain admission
where her excellent grades
actually meant something
but then she had
a revelation
her passion had always been the soul
the mind not the body
surgery is like so concrete
its almost like being a carpenter
but now
my passion has always been
what goes on inside  thoughts and feelings
it was like a window had opened
not anatomy
if psychology will make you happy
then do it
i think youre really brave
i cant take it anymore
i dont want to
she left him
though he was devastated
he had to respect
the way she took control of her life
she observed her fellow students
norways future spiritual advisers
mostly girls with borderline
eating disorders
say youre at a party
she still felt trapped in
the role of model student
all this cramming
when was life supposed to start
whats your name
julie
the persons name is julie
lets say julie and i
meet at a party
and we feel a mutual attraction
hypothetically
actually she was a visual person
now i know
i want to be a photographer
a photographer
i see
julie spent her student loan
on cameras and lenses
as long as youre serious about it
no safety net no holding back
need help
she took a temp job
in a bookstore
started a photography course
super
she made new friends
it felt like coming home
suddenly oslo was a different city
new places new faces
hi aksel
right
youre the comic book artist
shed heard
he was the creator of bobcat
sorry im a wild animal
have you read it
yeah
so
she pretended shed read it
she only remembered one strip
shed found vaguely sexist
i know what you mean
nothings ever good enough
the only thing worse than
all the idiots is yourself
but
if we go on ill fall in love with you
then itll be too late
maybe we should agree to
stop seeing each other
the problem is our age difference
im just afraid well fall into
a vicious circle
youre much younger than i am
youll start to question who you are
im past 40
ive entered a new phase
whereas you still need time
to find yourself
you dont need me waiting
you need to be completely free
im just afraid well hurt each other
later she said
that was the precise moment
she fell in love with him
shall i put your bag in the bedroom
yes please
i have two copies of a book
huh
yeah
ill throw one away
can i have two shelves
how many closets do you need
how many can i have
no thats not how it works
this is antique glass
all wavy and stuff
no dont do that not like that
no
lift this catch here
im terrified itll break
i gaze out this window
no way
im not kidding
hey thats how relationships work
shes a bit frosty towards me
thats new
yeah why do you think that is
its embarrassing to say
weve been single together
lived that life
then suddenly i move in with you
and youre happy
yeah
no no no
did you date this guy
yeah just a fling
okay
stop
youre so predictable
lets just fuck
hello
chapter 1
the others
happy to see you
me too
doing good
yeah
hi martin
welcome
thanks for coming
dad designed it
we should renovate
but dont want to change anything
its beautiful
yeah but theres stuff like that damp
we get this room
because were childless
dibs on the top bunk
i always feel that tone doesnt like me
shes just shy
thats what you say about boring people
its my turn now
okay
thank you
vin
vin de blanc
thanks
do you have any friends with kids yet
no only one
guess this feels unfamiliar
theyre very sweet
thanks
so what are you doing now julie
aksel says youve started writing
well i wouldnt exactly
call it writing
being modest
no
seems so
is there anything youd like to do
as a career
questions questions karianne
that question was vulgar
when we were students
lucky you
yeah we were
true we had a lot of freedom
being young today is different
the pressure is heartbreaking
theres no time to think
always something on the screen
take william
if we dont set limits
he spends his life on screens
nice try
okay
no its not your turn
its martins turn
julies still the closest
bedtime
shes exhausted
no
no
yes
no
i dont want to go to bed
i dont want to
eva dont make another scene
come here
no i dont want to
let go
you silly girl
i dont want to
but i want you to
i dont want to
kids can be intense
well its okay
fun with kids
yeah
cant we just enjoy it
please no fights
there are kids here and its chaos
just try
try playing with them
or something okay
please
spare me the kid talk
sorry but i wasnt the one who started
youre with someone whos
younger than you theres a gap
youre almost 30
not a bad age to have kids
im 44 i want to go to the next level
with you
it has nothing to do with my friends
you seem to be waiting for something
i dont know what
hello
jeez
i didnt want to get into this
really not
everythings on your terms
you have time off
so were on holiday
you agreed
after you publish you get bored
and start talking about kids
the others here have kids
so its an issue
not true
it is true
and then
you get a new idea at some point
and disappear into your drawing board
what are you saying
dont start its not cool
shut up please
of course id be there if we had kids
you know that
you know i want children
sure and ill also want kids
at some point
but i dont know
i have no maternal instinct right
no youd make a great mom
im sure of it
i want to have children too
at some point
so what are we waiting for
what has to happen first
i dont know what exactly
i just want to do more first
okay like what
whats the obstacle
i dont know why do you ask
your concept is flawed
most people have kids without
sorting out their life first
they figure it out
flawed
thats how most people do it
but i dont want everything
to happen on your terms
based on what you want
fine i got it
but what do you want
oh please we have to stop
i need sleep
to put up with those people
i know a guy
who has a theory about that
he says we have
a limited number of sperm
say three trillion in your lifetime
jerk off too much
and you run out
could be true
easy now portnoy
how fascinating
personally i feel like
i know everything
about male problems
erectile dysfunction
morning wood
infatuation with young women
premature ejaculation
nice work aksel
its in all the books and movies
wheres the menstrual period
female orgasm and desire where
good question tell us
in juicy detail
no the point is
it shouldnt be taboo
if men had periods
thats all wed hear about
can you womansplain it
a bit better
what do you mean
like mansplaining but womansplaining
what
mansplaining is
when a 45yearold man explains
how things really are
to a younger woman
nice demonstration
my pleasure
ding great
whiskey anyone
hows the senior citizen club doing
come on
look whos here
are you okay
not really
show me
no
let me see
well laugh about it later
its just a scratch
kariannes such a drama queen
its my fault
not at all julie
it is i always overdo it
i know being here isnt easy for you
im not into this whole
happy family thing either
im glad it turned into a party tonight
i hope you had fun
what the hells wrong with you
whats wrong with having a little fun
i didnt have any fun
sorry that happened
you dont care
shut up just shut up
you dont give a shit about me
shall we make a baby
fuck you
hi
good morning
theres coffee and cups
chapter 2
cheating
sorry i forgot
whats your line of work
i work in a bookstore
which one
norli by the university
could you excuse me for a moment
could you sign
sure ill just finish this
any new bobcat in the pipeline
ive moved on
do you work fulltime there
or are you just temping on weekends
sorry
bye
hey i think ill head home
okay
you good
yeah
sure
yeah im fine
i can stay if you like
its okay
but i have to stay a bit longer
of course
okay see you at home
hi can i have a smoke
of course
i had my second child
ten years later
now were supposed
to introduce solids at 4 months
what made the pediatricians
change their minds
do you cuddle your kids
sure a lot
theyll be drug addicts
theyll be addicts
because i cuddle them
yeah according to new research
new research says
you shouldnt cuddle your kids
i realize it must be counterintuitive
for a mother
but motherhood upsets
your limbic system
so my kids are going to be drug addicts
thats ridiculous
do you have children
no but im a doctor
i have a medical perspective
babies express themselves by crying
its normal for a mother or a father
to comfort them
hi
not asking me the usual questions
which ones
who i am what i do
who are you what do you do
i hate those questions
theyre especially bad
when youre a doctor
are you a doctor
no you are
which questions should i ask
ask me who i know here
who do you know here
nobody
i crashed the party
you just waltzed in
okay
nothings gonna happen
of course not
im with someone i love
me too
and i cant stand cheating
ive been there never again
right cheating is
no good
but where do you draw the line
you can feel it
if i do this
is that cheating
no
what about this
no thats permissible
is it
and hurting someone
whos not your partner
you hurt your partner
is that cheating
did that hurt
did it
feel good
yeah it did
okay
let me smell your sweat
no
yes
seriously
yes thats allowed
it stinks
yes
the kind of smell you never forget
my turn to smell you
no please
i regret it now
let me smell
i think you smell nice
i dont know if
this is permissible
go ahead
okay
you start
then ill go next
i actually think sex is best
when the dick isnt too hard
because
in a way then im the one
who makes it hard you know
my secret will be dumb now
i guess i misunderstood
i was going to say
i like the barcode project
it looks pretty from the bridge
when i go to work
i expose my darkest secrets
and you
you said secrets
not darkest
so why is that a secret
because everyone thinks its ugly
sorry were
can i whisper it
okay
what
sorry i seem to
be sitting on everything
my bad
theres nothing sexual about that
not at all
although you do like soft dicks
yeah
okay your turn
i cant pee
just relax
im going this way
okay
whats your name
julie
im eivind eivind
dont say it
why not
ill find you on facebook and
good thinking
okay
bye
bye
we didnt cheat
no
not at all
no
bye
chapter 3
oral sex in the age of metoo
aksel
aksel i need to tell you something
aksel
a friend told me she had sex
with a man
who pumped his dick into her mouth
while he held her head
she was confused
because she enjoyed it
it really turned her on
can you be a feminist
and still enjoy being mouthfucked
most women i know are ambivalent
about performing oral sex
they must act as if they like
the pathetic expectation
that itll turn them on
i like it flaccid
so i create the stiffness
instead of having it thrust upon me
this is good
yeah
its over the top
i dont agree with everything
but its very well written
original very good
what will you do with it
i dont know
you really think its good
yeah absolutely
you sure
yeah im not lying
no
are you sure
dont you dare doubt it
its pretty cerebral
but it turns me on too
right
kinda
is that why you wrote it
intellectual viagra
yeah
it works
her piece
oral sex in the age of metoo
was published on jubelno
it was widely shared and set off
a lively facebook debate
with the strong painkillers im on
i cant drive
chapter 4

theyve got that
resident
resident parking there
yeah
its made it much easier
to find a space
you just have to pay
and move the car every half hour
is that the reason
you dont come to see us
because its hard to drive in town
thats not it
then what is it
well you know
with my painkillers
im not allowed to drive

the good thing is
hes open about it

how long will it take
two weeks
okay no thanks
they dont have it either
okay
we can try at ark
thank you
i told her
i forgot my sunglasses
i just had to say
that i know what we said
but i think about you a lot
and
i dont want to bug you
if youre happy
are you
i dont know what to say
say nothing
id like to see you again
just to talk
i mean im not going to
but id like to see you again
just to
im at åpent bakeri in barcode
nearly every day
i work there i mean
if you want to
so
eivind
yes
your glasses
oh right fuck
language opens the door
to the subconscious
freud was a great writer
he could be selfcritical
he never hesitated
to revise his theories
he viewed each individual patient
as a research subject
freud didnt distinguish between
therapy and research
i find that very compelling
especially these days
when scientific methodology
is applied
even in the humanities
enough about freud
hows the movie coming along
isnt it almost done
yeah ive seen it but
you have
yes
its no longer mine at all
is it as bad as you feared
the worst thing is how
theyve housetrained bobcat
its all very sanitized and safe
ill show you something
a mockup of the movie poster
i have to admit
im embarrassed my names on it
shit
no seriously
you must be kidding no way
thats the poster for real
lets see
looks like chip and dale
holy shit
should i laugh or cry
everything was butchered
the story all the details
they removed the starfish
sorry im lost
what starfish
its you know
the butthole the anus
his butt is smooth in the movie
this thing is gone
thats bad in my book
in underground comics you shit
you puke you fuck and all that stuff
bobcat is a wild cat
in a world of domestic cats
hes a rebel against the bourgeoisie
one of the most iconic buttholes ever
coffee
yeah
i dont know what we should do
i have to go
aksel
we need to talk
yeah of course
whats wrong
julie said shed been thinking
it wasnt his fault
nothing he could have changed
its not anything youve done
its not your fault but i feel
it was about
all their old arguments
things they both knew
it was bad timing
theyd met in different phases of life
they wanted different things
we want different things
are you leaving me
yeah
i want it to be over
are you sure youre yourself right now
what do you mean
do you realize
do you realize what youre doing
what youre destroying
yes of course
thats why its so hard
where will you live
i dont know
you dont know
no with mom
move home to mom
yeah until i find a place
okay
no come on
its over
ive had it what else can i say
is something else bothering you
and youre venting on me
no
ive thought about it for a long time
it feels right
have you met someone
no
im so sick of all this julie
dammit
sick to death of it
but okay
just leave if thats what you want
ill take a walk while you pack
julie said he deserved
a more grounded woman
ready for children
who was dependable
didnt flake out every six months
but i like you flaky
aksel said he liked her flaky
that he needed someone like that
who could draw him out
of his drawing board
and as for having kids
he said
hed rather be childless with her
than have kids with anyone else
you know thats not the only problem
so what is the problem
its a combination of things
not just that
i can see youre in a crisis right now
i can understand that
but if you love me
well sort it all out
yes i do love you
and i dont love you
julie felt that this sentence
the way she said it
her emphasis on certain words
summed up the impossibility of it all
i feel like a spectator in my own life
like im playing a supporting role
in my own life
i get that you feel stuck
you need a change
but is this the solution
this is exactly my point
im trying to tell you how i feel
and youre defining my feelings
i see what youre doing
what am i doing
tell me what im doing
shut up and ill tell you
youre acting out the confrontation
you never dared have with your father
youre taking it out on me
is that so
what do you know about it
this is the crux of our relationship
everything we feel
we have to put into words
sometimes i just want to feel things
you insist on being so
damn strong all the time
for you
being strong
is about formulating things
if you analyze things
at every psychological level
you think youre strong
because im less analytical
you think im weaker
she said she was terrified
of being alone
terrified of living without him
that when she left
shed be like bambi on the ice
and that was precisely
why she had to do it
aksel mumbled soothing words
she didnt hear
she was thinking about how
at the age of 30
shed just compared herself to bambi
no
im pathetic
no youre not
aksel
hey
i didnt mean what i said
its okay
i said plenty of things too
stay a little longer
youll regret it
im sure i will
the saddest thing
is one day youll want kids
in any case
youll have other relationships
and youll realize that
what we had was unique
i know
you dont but i do
ive had many relationships
i know how hard it is
nobody communicates like we do
laughs like we do
who knows
maybe well get back together someday
then and there
she meant it
i mean it
chapter 6
finnmark highlands
are you cold
yeah
it looked easier on youtube
i told you we should practice
wait
this one first
are you sure
yes this goes on top
right but is it first
isnt the other one first
no thats the top
okay
eivind turned it into a funny story
he told everyone
but it touched
something deeper in her
awoke something in her
she googled her family name
her grandfather came
from the far north
the dna sample
she sent to america confirmed it
eivind didnt see how
her newfound identity
as 31 sami
connected to mindexpanding substances
and unrelated exotic rituals
but tried to be supportive
as she became increasingly militant
she saw how climate change
was hurting indigenous people
inuit starving as seals vanish
melting ice ruining reindeer pastures
aborigines dying of skin cancer
from the hole in the ozone
eivind could forget
about flying to new york
breathe in all the way up
she made them live
more sustainably
he could always do better
study the ingredients more closely
consider the environmental impact
of his purchases
plastic is killing the oceans
norwegian cod
was ferried to china and back
cobalt mining was destroying the congo
batteries had blood on their hands
the sum of western guilt
sat beside him on the couch
went to bed with him at night
everything was weighed against
the greater cause
he felt he was betraying sunniva
betraying the sami people
felt like the worlds worst person
but couldnt resist
i forgot my sunglasses inside
right
be right back
chapter 7
a new chapter
eivind didnt want kids either
climate researchers foresaw
hard times for future generations
overpopulation was the reason
everything was falling apart
julie liked how this pessimism
added depth
to his cheerful nature
but she could tell
he had other reasons too
eivinds father like julies
tended to forget birthdays
eivind would often say
according to my fathers calendar
im 12 years old
theyre all hard no ripe ones
people die of thirst in chile
because avocados need so much water
still following sunniva on instagram
yeah she posts interesting links
about the environment
we dont message or anything
shes got over 30000 followers
for showing off her ass
shes not showing off her ass
shes doing yoga
its yoga
okay she shows it off a bit
i dont mind you following her
its not a problem but
i dont want to be
the sensible choice
while shes the sexy one
theres nothing sensible about you
i mean
yeah
the angle of her pelvis
its yoga
thats not yoga
it is yoga
you liked it
oh my god
thats not cool
i had to like it
thats right
so thats why
chapter 8
julies narcissistic circus
i want people to watch me dance
its annoying as hell
you can make a fool of yourself
on the dance floor and still be cool
so true ive noticed that
when we dance
you take up all the space
yeah but its also like
everyone look at me
yeah thats my point
youre always so mysterious
you still have your stash
whats that
whered you find it
what is it
magic mushrooms
have you tried it
yeah
right
whyd you do that
yuck
tastes like dirt
anyone
i dont feel anything
theyre probably too old
i gotta go
are you sure could be risky
come on man
weve done this before
well talk tomorrow
call me
adil
can you speak
its kicking in for him
julie
is it starting to kick in
you need water
its important
you have to drink lots of water
here
drink it all
youll be okay
you know im here for you
julie
drink the water
its okay im here
julie are you okay
i thought id make it
are you okay
thought we could use some coffee
we wont be doing that again
you should take a shower
do i smell bad
is that
oh my god
oh my god
i need to take a shower
dont worry its not urgent
shall i make breakfast
i feel i can be myself with you
completely
you werent yourself before
i was but i felt like
i had to be
a bit
like i was when we first met
thanks for putting up with me
i love you
chapter 9
bobcat wrecks xmas
bobcat wrecks xmas
have you read your
old bobcat comics since you grew up
because in our day and age
they seem so inappropriate and murky
that we feel almost sick
reading them
its unpleasant to realize
you created a character
who gained popularity
at the expense of women
okay i get it
youre saying art should be pleasant
do you think its art
i brought along
some of your early comics
bobcat is one thing
but then theres dick wolf dick
pedo the parrot
right i dont really think
this is the right medium to
explain comic book humor
have you ever considered that
some of your readers
may have been victims
of incest or rape
do we stop creating
because some people might feel bad
artists get killed for drawing things
others find offensive theyre shot
are you comparing mohammed caricatures
with drawings of women with big tits
or with incest
whats your point
well yes and no
its a bit of a copout
to claim freedom of speech
when people criticize you
were discussing your work right now
so nobodys censoring you
as a woman im upset
im offended
though were not supposed to say that
you have a choice
you dont have to feel offended
its not a choice
this is very generational
one author cannot be held
solely responsible
i think art has to be messy and free
it has to be a bit dangerous
to be fun
i want art to be a form of therapy
where i can express and work through
all my unacceptable thoughts
all my darkest impulses
but youre using your male privilege
to mock people weaker than you
its hardly art or even humor
sorry its not
smart enough to be satire
but this isnt about me
like when i create something
its not just me talking
i know that much
do you
lets say i draw this interview
as a cartoon
the comic version of me
might call you a whore
it doesnt mean i think that
it could be
a parody of a certain type
of insecure male
you used the word whore
yes i said whore
youre not interested in what i mean
cant you see
thats crass sexualization
i think were on a slippery slope here
all you postfeminists
are so fucking selfrighteous
thank you marthe refstad
and aksel willmann
the term is sex worker now
by the way
chapter 10
first person singular
im happy to help
long time no see
yeah
how are you
okay and you
im good
do you ever talk to aksel
is he okay
yeah well
i heard the radio interview
yeah
he went a bit far
hes not doing that well
did you know hes sick
aksel
havent you heard
he has cancer
sorry i thought you knew
it spread quickly
they discovered it too late
cancer
pancreatic
but
how is he coping
pretty well under the circumstances
but its hard
the prognosis
is not good
its incurable
thanks for letting me know
i thought you knew
no i hadnt heard anything
its just
i didnt know
when did you write this
have you read it
i was moving it to paper recycling
its very good
you think
yeah it sucked me right in
its really really great
i mean
its like
what
well
i have to say
its really nice to read about you
but its not about me
but the christmas scene
is your family right
yeah but its fiction
you didnt get that
i made it up
okay its fiction
in any case
its good
because its me
no because its nice
nice
yeah nice good
well written
the way you write
is really great
like here
too many memories overlapping
blending into a blur
that resonates with me
its well written truly good
its not well written
whats wrong
suddenly youre into literature
what was the last book you read
are you okay whats up
why
you criticize
everything i do these days
sorry but going through my trash
is pretty invasive
cant you see that
relax
relax
calm down
relaxing is your specialty
you dont mind
serving coffee till youre 50
but i want more
thats hurtful
i dont know what to say
chapter 11
positive
hello
hey
have you eaten
yeah but i can make pasta if you like
no i dont need any if youve eaten
oops sorry
it started with a backache
ive had backaches before
i didnt worry
then my skin turned almost golden
i thought i looked good
it turned out to be jaundice
mom said i was born jaundiced
they put me in a light box
is it painful
no not really
its okay
they block selected
neural pathways with botox
thats good
yeah it keeps me from taking
too many painkillers
hows your family doing
fine i guess
mom still follows your every move
and your dad
ive basically cut him off
good
he can chase me if he likes
does he
no not really
two coffees
they thought it was hilarious
in some circumstances
morbid humour can be funny
even anal sex at a bar mitzvah
it makes me laugh
but im an old guy now
no
well you know
i kind of expected this
id given up long before i got sick
really i just watch
my favourite old movies over and over
lynch the godfather part ii
how many times can you watch
dog day afternoon
many times
you should
absolutely
sometimes i listen to music
i havent heard before
but
its old as well
music i didnt know about
but from when i grew up
it felt as though id already given up
i grew up in an age
without internet and mobile phones
no but honestly
i sound like an old fart
but i think about it a lot
the world that i knew
has disappeared
for me it was all about going to stores
record stores
id take the tram
to voices record store in grünerløkka
leaf through
used comics at pretty price
i can close my eyes and see
the aisles at video nova in majorstua
i grew up in a time
when culture was passed along
through objects
they were interesting because
we could live among them
we could pick them up
hold them in our hands
compare them
a bit like books
yeah a bit like books
thats all i have
i spent my life doing that
collecting all that stuff
comics books
and
i just continued
even when it stopped giving me
the powerful emotions
i felt in my early 20s
i continued anyway
and
now its all i have left
knowledge and memories
of stupid futile things
nobody cares about
dont say that
youve got the comics you created
i wish id had what you had
to be able to draw
without doubting that youre doing
what youre supposed to do
i really wish i had that
yeah but
ive got cancer im dying
of course im being retrospective
you said youve done that for ages
not for that long
in recent years i reached
a point in life when suddenly
it just happened
when
i began to worship what had been
and now i have nothing else
i have no future
i can only look back
and
its not even nostalgia
its
fear of death
its because im scared
it has nothing to do with art
im just trying to process
i have surgery tomorrow at 9
i felt i could tell you anything
you wouldnt judge me
youre the least
judgemental person i know
i dont have anyone i can talk to
the way we used to talk
can you tell me
what you used to tell me
i hated hearing it at the time
but can you tell me
ill be a good mother
are you pregnant
congratulations
how do you feel
good or bad
i dont know
im not sure
it was an accident
i mustve been careless
i mean clearly i was
were you really sure
sure you wanted kids
i was scared too
i had doubts of course
but i didnt want to show them
to keep you from
i never doubted
youd make a good mother
i saw that you doubted it
if i regret one thing
its that i never managed
to make you see how wonderful you are
what are you thinking
this is hard to hear
but will you keep it
i dont know
i wasted so much time
worrying about what could go wrong
but what did go wrong
was never the things i worried about
if hes a kind man then go for it
with a kind father
and you as the mother
everything will be fine
your voice has stayed in my head
we still have great conversations
no way
about what
mostly about comics
eclectic tastes
same here
i have imaginary conversations with you
im sure i remember things about you
that youve forgotten
and the other way round
yeah maybe
when im gone
all that stuff about you
will go with me
may i ask you a question
had you already met him
when you broke up with me
yeah
why didnt you tell me
i dont know
i didnt dare
and now youre breaking up with him
no why do you say that
maybe because you dont seem happy
about the baby
and thats what you do
when things get tough
im glad im pregnant
im sorry
its alright
you were the most important
relationship in my life
you dont have to say anything
i know its not the same for you
thats normal
you have many years left to live
but i know i feel it
and i want you to know
you were the love of my life
youre a damn good person
i shouldve told you before
but i couldnt
im pregnant
how long have you known
i know we dont want kids
no
i dont know if i do
i feel like i never see anything through
i go from one thing to another
i need time
to think about all this
about us
its okay
chapter 12
everything comes to an end
thats where i lived
we moved there when i was 8
shall we knock
no i dont think so
what do you remember from here
i remember these colours
they were always my reference
when i drew my comics
these colours
and i remember
the local drunk
who was super nice
im so tired of pretending
everything is okay
it sucks being in so much pain
it sucks
everything sucks
and
i dont want to be a memory for you
i dont want to be a voice in your head
i dont want to live on through my art
i want to live in my flat
i want to live
i want to live in my flat with you
i want to be happy together
bye
bye
