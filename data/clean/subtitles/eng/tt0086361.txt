  have you got emotional problems 
  you think l need a shrink 
  how late are you working tonight 
  till three 
  want to come over 
  last time  l almost got brain damage 
you party too hard 
you ought to be a tag team 
good guys are hard to find 
why don t you try the army 
  are we on later 
  no  l can t make it 
why not 
  lately  l ve been career oriented 
  what s that mean 
l don t have time for relationships
right now 
that right 
well  let me tell you something 
guys like you aren t relationships 
you re exercise 
  why do you have to go  lt s only six 
  l want to get something going today 
  don t you want to stay for breakfast 
  no  l m not hungry 
  what s wrong 
  nothing 
l just want to get something
going today 
  you will 
  l ll see you later 
  l ll miss you 
  you don t have to say that  jackie 
l know l don t 
l m a dancer by nature  l studied
for four years and now l teach 
  but l m very available for tv work 
  no 
good day 
acting roles   l do dramatic parts 
l can do comedy roles 
l d consider doing a soap opera
or even a roadshow 
a musical of some sort 
l would consider
doing a print ad 
lf you re looking for the outdoor type 
l m good at some sports 
like weightlifting and stickball
and push ups  and   
lf absolutely necessary  l don t mind
doing any kind of extra work 
except l promised my mother
l d never do any nudity 
l guess she s afraid
that l might get a cold 
but the fact still is 
l m a dancer by nature 
whatever 
yeah  whatever 
lt s like you re invisible 
they make you feel
like you re wasting your time 
what s really weird is that
they all sound like my father used to 
why be down on yourself 
you know what you can do 
  what about you 
  what about me 
you ve been doing choruses
for six years 
don t you want to do something
that s all you 
  lf it happens  good  lf not  too bad 
  how could you think that way 
a woman s dancing career
is half as long as a man s 
so l have half as many chances
as you of making it 
  l ve got to be real with myself 
  l don t know  l guess so 
mm   cherry 
  see you later 
  will you come tonight 
  lt s the last show

you did try to damage my head 
but the thing is that l   
l amazingly respect your dancing
talent  and your womanhood 
l didn t always respect womanhood

l got this new  mature outlook  l don t
smoke  l don t drink  l don t curse

that s it  relax 
we have a conceptual interpretation
problem  which is easy to overcome
if you forget that you re dancers
working for a couple of bucks 
you re translators of body language 
that s all dancing is  body language 
so don t waste my time
going through the motions of emotions 
you got to feel
what the hell you re doing 
the show s called   satan s alley   
lt s a journey through hell 
lt ends with an ascent to heaven 
lt s simple  but if it s going to work 
you ve got to bust your asses 
  l didn t say anything 
  but l    shoot me  shoot me twice 
  lt s all right  really 
  l got hung up  what can l say

anyway  l m freezing out here 
lf nothing else  you ll have
an interesting chapter for your diary 
you know the way out 
merry christmas 
l can t take all the blame now  can l 
lt takes more than one
to lose such a fine line
that lies between
but holds together
hearts in the night
touch at a time
and l m finding out the hard way
lt s going to take some tears
a little bit of heartache
we re like islands in the stream
watching all our dreams start to fade
fading away
a moment gone is gone forever
lt s like water through your hands
and you spin the wheel of misfortune
watching it turn
you live and you learn
l keep reaching out
and come up empty handed
when did l let you down 
or did l leave you stranded 
and l m finding out the hard way
lt s going to take some tears
a little bit of heartache
and we re like islands in the stream
watching all our dreams start to fade
fading away
start to fade
fading away
start to fade
fading away
fade away
  jackie  l m sorry 
  l don t want to see you tonight 
l just forgot to call you
