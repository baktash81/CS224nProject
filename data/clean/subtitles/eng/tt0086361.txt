you dont want to share
l dont need your handmedowns
have you got emotional problems
you think l need a shrink
how late are you working tonight
till three
want to come over
last time l almost got brain damage
you party too hard
you ought to be a tag team
good guys are hard to find
why dont you try the army
are we on later
no l cant make it
why not
lately lve been career oriented
whats that mean
l dont have time for relationships
right now
that right
well let me tell you something
guys like you arent relationships
youre exercise
why do you have to go lts only six
l want to get something going today
dont you want to stay for breakfast
no lm not hungry
whats wrong
nothing
l just want to get something
going today
you will
lll see you later
lll miss you
you dont have to say that jackie
l know l dont
lm a dancer by nature l studied
for four years and now l teach
but lm very available for tv work
no
good day
acting rolesl do dramatic parts
l can do comedy roles
ld consider doing a soap opera
or even a roadshow
a musical of some sort
l would consider
doing a print ad
lf youre looking for the outdoor type
lm good at some sports
like weightlifting and stickball
and pushups and
lf absolutely necessary l dont mind
doing any kind of extra work
except l promised my mother
ld never do any nudity
l guess shes afraid
that l might get a cold
but the fact still is
lm a dancer by nature
whatever
yeah whatever
lts like youre invisible
they make you feel
like youre wasting your time
whats really weird is that
they all sound like my father used to
why be down on yourself
you know what you can do
what about you
what about me
youve been doing choruses
for six years
dont you want to do something
thats all you
lf it happens good lf not too bad
how could you think that way
a womans dancing career
is half as long as a mans
so l have half as many chances
as you of making it
lve got to be real with myself
l dont know l guess so
mmcherry

and you spin the wheel of misfortune
watching it turn
you live and you learn
l keep reaching out
and come up emptyhanded
when did l let you down
or did l leave you stranded
and lm finding out the hard way
lts going to take some tears
a little bit of heartache
and were like islands in the stream
watching all our dreams start to fade
fading away
start to fade
fading away
start to fade
fading away
fade away
