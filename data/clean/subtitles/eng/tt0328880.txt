when the great mammoths
still roamed our lands 
it s the story
of my two brothers and me 
when the three of us were young 
we were taught
that the world is full of magic 
 man continues
in foreign language 
the source of this magic
is the ever changing lights
that dance across the sky 
the shaman woman of our village
told us that these lights
are the spirits of our ancestors 
and that they have the power
to make changes in our world 
small things become big 
winter turns to spring 
one thing always changes
into another 
but the greatest change i ever saw
was that of my brother 
a boy who desperately
wanted to be a man 
  get down 
  what 
get down  get down 
kenai 
   animals grunting 
   boy coughs 
never try to milk a caribou 
   grunts 
   groans 
   laughs 
   clears throat 
no  no  don t  no  come on  don t  no 
hey  will you two knock it off 
that s all right 
after today  he won t treat me like that 
oh  right  the big manhood ceremony 
doesn t matter what the spirits say 
you ll always be our baby brother 
  well  wait till i get my totem 
  baby brother 
hey  i said knock it off 
the quicker we get these fish 
the faster we get to your ceremony 
let s all just try and get along
for a few hours  okay  denahi 
  whatever you say 
  okay  ken   
so  what are we waiting for 
 grunting 
 sitka laughs 
  whoo 
  whoo 
when the earth was young
and the air was sweet
and the mountains kissed the sky
in the great beyond
with its many paths
man and nature lived side by side
in this wilderness of danger and beauty
lived three brothers bonded by love
their hearts full of joy
they ask now for guidance
reaching out to the skies up above
great spirits of all who lived before
take our hands and lead us
fill our hearts and souls
with all you know
show us that in your eyes
we are all the same
brothers to each other
in this world we remain
truly brothers all the same
give us wisdom to pass to each other
and give us strength so we understand
that the things we do
the choices we make
give direction to all life s plans
to look and wonder
at all we ve been given
in a world that s not always as it seems
every corner we turn
only leads to another
a journey ends but another begins
great spirits of all who lived before
take our hands and lead us
fill our hearts and souls
with all you know
show us that in your eyes
we are all the same
brothers to each other
in this world we remain
truly brothers all the same
  kenai s back

kenai  are you excited
about getting your spirit rock today

truly brothers all the same

with the biggest pain in the neck
i ve ever met 
what do you expect
from a little brother 
okay  buddy  your turn

  okay  okay  here we go 
 clears throat 
this year i watched my mom
in a life and death struggle
battling the most fiercest creature ever 
  who s next 
  what 
wait a minute  i think we all want
to hear the rest of that one  koda 
i thought you might say that 
hmm    let s see 
it was probably the fifth or sixth
most coldest day in my entire life 
me and mom were eating fish 
having a great time 
all of a sudden she pushes me into
the bushes and tells me to be real quiet 
she says   i smell something  
so i started sniffing 
there s something in the woods
running towards us 
getting closer and closer 
   gasps 
   chuckles 
and then  out of the trees 
jumps a hunter 
 all gasp 
and now there s nowhere for mom to go 
the monster has her backed up
against this giant glacier 
the monster attacks 
but mom s too quick for him 
and before he can do it again  she
stands up real big and yells   go away  
   shouting 
  sitka  kenai 
mom smells more of them 
there s a whole pack
coming right at us 
sitka  no  the bear  behind you 
she runs to stop them
before they get to me 
they re all around her 
poking her with sticks 
  kenai  sitka 
  the whole thing broke and fell off 
there was ice everywhere 
she couldn t hold her breath
any longer  and pow 
she bursts out of the water 
i ve never been so scared in my life 
  kenai  i m going after the bear 
  koda 
denahi  sitka wouldn t want it 
kenai  sitka s not here
because of that monster 
whoa  fell off a glacier 
i ve never seen anything like that 
  can you imagine 
   whimpering 
kenai  what s the matter  kenai 
female  what happened next 
female 2  was she okay 
hey  kenai  what s wrong 
where you going

you told me last night 
  yeah 
  well  i have a story to tell you 
really  what s it about 
well  it s kind of about a man 
and kind of about a bear 
but mostly it s about a monster 
a monster who did something so bad   
everywhere i turn i hurt someone
but there s nothing i can say
to change the things i ve done
i d do anything within my power
i d give everything i ve got
but the path i seek
is hidden from me now
koda  i did something very wrong 
brother bear  i let you down
i don t like this story 
you trusted me  believed in me
and i let you down
your mother s not coming 
of all the things i hid from you
i cannot hide the shame
and i pray someone
no  no 
something will come
to take away the pain
there s no way out
of this dark place
no  no future
i know i can t be free
but i can t see another way
and i can t face another day
koda  koda 
koda 
koda  i wish i could   
if there was just some way   
i d give anything if
