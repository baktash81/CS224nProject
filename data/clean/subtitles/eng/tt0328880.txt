when the great mammoths
still roamed our lands
its the story
of my two brothers and me
when the three of us were young
we were taught
that the world is full of magic
man continues
in foreign language
the source of this magic
is the everchanging lights
that dance across the sky
the shaman woman of our village
told us that these lights
are the spirits of our ancestors
and that they have the power
to make changes in our world
small things become big
winter turns to spring
one thing always changes
into another
but the greatest change i ever saw
was that of my brother
a boy who desperately
wanted to be a man
get down
what
get down get down
kenai
animals grunting
boy coughs
never try to milk a caribou
grunts
groans
laughs
clears throat
no no dont no come on dont no
hey will you two knock it off
thats all right
after today he wont treat me like that
oh right the big manhood ceremony
doesnt matter what the spirits say
youll always be our baby brother
well wait till i get my totem
baby brother
hey i said knock it off
the quicker we get these fish
the faster we get to your ceremony
lets all just try and get along
for a few hours okay denahi
whatever you say
okay ken
so what are we waiting for
grunting
sitka laughs
whoo
whoo
when the earth was young
and the air was sweet
and the mountains kissed the sky
in the great beyond
with its many paths
man and nature lived side by side
in this wilderness of danger and beauty
lived three brothers bonded by love
their hearts full of joy
they ask now for guidance
reaching out to the skies up above
great spirits of all who lived before
take our hands and lead us
fill our hearts and souls
with all you know
show us that in your eyes
we are all the same
brothers to each other
in this world we remain
truly brothers all the same
give us wisdom to pass to each other
and give us strength so we understand
that the things we do
the choices we make
give direction to all lifes plans
to look and wonder
at all weve been given
in a world thats not always as it seems
every corner we turn
only leads to another
a journey ends but another begins
great spirits of all who lived before
take our hands and lead us
fill our hearts and souls
with all you know
show us that in your eyes
we are all the same
brothers to each other
in this world we remain
truly brothers all the same

the bushes and tells me to be real quiet
she says i smell something
so i started sniffing
theres something in the woods
running towards us
getting closer and closer
gasps
chuckles
and then out of the trees
jumps a hunter
all gasp
and now theres nowhere for mom to go
the monster has her backed up
against this giant glacier
the monster attacks
but moms too quick for him
and before he can do it again she
stands up real big and yells go away
shouting
sitka kenai
mom smells more of them
theres a whole pack
coming right at us
sitka no the bear behind you
she runs to stop them
before they get to me
theyre all around her
poking her with sticks
kenai sitka
the whole thing broke and fell off
there was ice everywhere
she couldnt hold her breath
any longer and pow
she bursts out of the water
