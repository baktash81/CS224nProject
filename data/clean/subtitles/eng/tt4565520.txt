better than i do
okay so we have civilization
versus savagery
and reason versus impulse
so many exciting themes
in one little book right
over the break i want you to
read the next three chapters
thats three chapters and
i want you to write two pages
on either one of our themes
your choice
demerius

lap there what is it

gauntlet of destiny
has to say about that
demon lover
then the squid leg splits
okamisan in half
blood sprays everywhere
this is 26 stronger than
anything else on the market
it lasts up to four hours
not only are the lips fuller
theyre the most fantastic
color
slight tingle at first
but its so worth it
better than collagen
where is this from
the orient a lot of the
formulas are secret
i own the north american rights
oh thats lovely
and this would be an exclusive
for harolds

mr moss hello
we found some surprising
thematic similarities
between lord of the flies
bell rings
okay all right
you owe me two pages
have a really good break
where is this from
asia
dprk isnt that
north korea
youre trying to sell harolds
a north korean product
maybe
the north korea against which
the united states has
an embargo
now that embargo is kind
of like cuba you know
its sort of symbolic
20 years kate seen it all
right
well maybe not sex
with an octopus
that was a first
that was mine too
please
clears throat
i wanted your help to strategize
a big picture issue
because i see something
we both share
a deep love for this school
go falcons
i wanna do a little
rightbrained thinking
about a leftbrain problem
are we talking about the arb
test scores
im talking about empowerment
im saying lets be the change
lets not squander our energy
on acrimony and recriminations
um are you firing me
what
im sorry
im trying to ground floor
the discussions
so we dont waste our schools
resources on arbitration
and severance packages
those things threaten the school
that we love
yeah of course absolutely
sometimes a school can avoid
all that heartache
if a teacher simply vacates
his or her post
you want me to quit
no thats a personal decision
what i want doesnt matter
but i will say this
i see you flourishing in a
slightly less urban teaching
environment or perhaps in an
altogether different
can i admit something
you always have great hair
perhaps youd be happy
cutting hair
look i took this meeting
because lucas spoke
highly of you
he better have
but i dont think this
is a good fit for harolds
best of luck
seriously thats it
just because of where
a products made
a bit racist dont you think
