 we are going to have fun
on this island  understand 
 we are going to have fun
on this island 
  come now   said the
lord of the flies 
 get back to the others and
we ll forget the whole thing 
 this has gone quite far enough 
my poor  misguided child 
 do you think you know
better than i do  
okay  so we have civilization
versus savagery 
and reason versus impulse 
so many exciting themes
in one little book  right 
over the break  i want you to
read the next three chapters 
that s three chapters  and
i want you to write two pages   
on either one of our themes 
your choice 
demerius 
care to read us out to the bell 
no  no  no  not that one 
the one that you have on your
lap there  what is it 
uh    demon sword z 
 snickering 
okay  let s hear it  oh  come
on  let s finish class strong 
 now i have the power
of the five souls 
 let us see what the
gauntlet of destiny   
 has to say about that 
demon lover 
 then  the squid leg splits
okami san in half 
 blood sprays everywhere  
this is 26  stronger than
anything else on the market 
it lasts up to four hours 
not only are the lips fuller   
they re the most fantastic
color 
slight tingle at first 
but it s so worth it 
better than collagen 
where is this from 
the orient    a lot of the
formulas are secret 
i own the north american rights 
oh  that s lovely 
and this would be an exclusive
for harold s 
hm 
that s really starting to work 
what kind of comic is this 
it s not a comic  it s manga 
 put your demon powers in me 
squid 
 i want to feel your might
deep within  
damn  its tentacles are like
its dicks 
zack  your right 
 hold back nothing  my pet 
after i summon the demon 
all you can    
mr  moss  hello 
we found some surprising
thematic similarities   
between lord of the flies   
 bell rings 
okay  all right 
you owe me two pages 
have a really good break 
where is this from 
asia 
d p r k    isn t that
north korea 
you re trying to sell harold s
a north korean product 
maybe 
the north korea against which   
the united states has
an embargo 
now  that embargo is kind
of like cuba  you know 
it s sort of symbolic 
20 years  kate  seen it all 
right 
well  maybe not sex
with an octopus 
that was a first 
that was mine  too 
please 
 clears throat 
i wanted your help to strategize
a big picture issue   
because i see something
we both share 
a deep love for this school 
go falcons 
i wanna do a little
right brained thinking   
about a left brain problem 
are we talking about the arb
test scores 
i m talking about empowerment 
i m saying let s be the change 
let s not squander our energy
on acrimony and recriminations 
um    are you firing me 
what 
i m sorry 
i m trying to ground floor
the discussions   
so we don t waste our school s
resources on arbitration   
and severance packages 
those things threaten the school
that we love 
yeah  of course  absolutely 
sometimes a school can avoid
all that heartache   
if a teacher simply vacates
his or her post 
you want me to quit 
no  that s a personal decision 
what i want doesn t matter 
but i will say this   
i see you flourishing in a
slightly less urban teaching   
environment or perhaps in an
altogether different   
can i admit something 
you always have great hair 
perhaps you d be happy
cutting hair 
look  i took this meeting   
because lucas spoke
highly of you 
he better have 
but i don t think this
is a good fit for harold s 
best of luck 
seriously  that s it 
just because of where
a product s made 
a bit racist  don t you think 
okay  we re done 
no  you re done 
because i ll take my business
elsewhere 
where s the bathroom 
uh  there
