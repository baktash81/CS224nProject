your wife the night she was murdered 
lt was very bitter 
she said she was glad l knew 
that she hated all the sneaking around 
and she said that she wanted
a divorce in reno 
 what was your response 
 l told her l would not grant one 
  l ll see you in hell
before l see you in reno   
those were your words 
according to your neighbors 
lf they say so 
l really don t remember 
l was upset 
what happened after you argued
with your wife 
she packed a bag 
she packed a bag to go
and stay with mr  quentin 
glenn quentin  golfpro
at the snowden hills country club   
   whom you had discovered
was your wife s lover 
did you follow her 
l went to a few bars first 
later  l drove to his house
to confront them  they weren t home 
l parked in the turnout   
   and waited 
with what intention 
i m not sure 
i was confused  drunk 
i think   
   mostly i wanted to scare them 
when they arrived  you went up
to the house and murdered them 
l was sobering up 
l got back in the car
and l drove home to sleep it off 
along the way  l threw my gun
into the royal river 
l ve been very clear on this point 
l get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning   
   and finds your wife in bed
with her lover   
   riddled with  38 caliber bullets 
does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence  or is it just me 
yes  it does 
yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river   
   before the murders took place 
that s very convenient 
lt s the truth 
the police dragged that river for
three days  and nary a gun was found   
   so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets   
   taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims 
and that also   
   is very convenient 
lsn t it  mr  dufresne 
since l am innocent of this crime   
   l find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found 
ladies and gentlemen  you ve heard
all the evidence 
we have the accused at the scene
of the crime  we have footprints 
bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints 
a broken bourbon bottle 
likewise with fingerprints 
and most of all   
   we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover   
   lying dead in each other s arms 
they had sinned 
but was their crime so great   
   as to merit a death sentence 
while you think about that   
   think about this 
a revolver holds six bullets  not eight 
l submit that this was not
a hot blooded crime of passion 
that at least could be understood 
if not condoned 
no 
this was revenge   
   of a much more brutal 
cold blooded nature  consider this 
four bullets per victim 
not six shots fired  but eight 
that means that he fired
the gun empty   
   and then stopped to reload   
   so that he could shoot
each of them again 
an extra bullet per lover   
   right in the head 
you strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man  mr  dufresne 
lt chills my blood just to look at you 
by the power vested in me
by the state of maine   
   l hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back to back   
   one for each of your victims 
so be it 
sit 
we see you ve served
20 years of a life sentence 
 yes  sir 
 you feel you ve been rehabilitated 
yes  sir  absolutely  sir 
l mean  l learned my lesson 
l can honestly say
that l m a changed man 
l m no longer a danger to society 
that s god s honest truth 
aborted
hey  red 
how d it go 
same old shit  different day 
yeah  l know how you feel 
l m up for rejection next week 
yeah  l got rejected last week 
lt happens 
hey  red  bump me a deck 
get out of my face  man 
you re into me for five packs already 
four 
there must be a con like me
in every prison in america 
i m the guy who can get it for you 
cigarettes  a bag of reefer 
if that s your thing   
   bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid s high school graduation 
damn near anything within reason 
yes  sir 
i m a regular sears and roebuck 
so when andy dufresne
came to me in 1949   
   and asked me to smuggle
rita hayworth into the prison for him   
   i told him    no problem    
andy came to shawshank prison   
   in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging 
on the outside  he d been vice president
of a large portland bank 
good work for a man so young 
hey  red

fresh fish today 
we re reeling them in 
i admit i didn t think much ofandy
first time i laid eyes on him 
looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over 
that was my first impression of the man 
what do you say 
that tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass 
that guy  never happen 
 1 0 cigarettes 
 that s a rich bet 
who s going to prove me wrong

   and those bars slam home

old life blown away
in the blink of an eye 
nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it 
most new fish come close to madness
the first night 
somebody always breaks down crying 
happens every time 
the only question is   
   who s it going to be 
it s as good a thing
to bet on as any  i guess 
i had my money on andy dufresne

oh  no  here he comes

fine morning  isn t it 
you know why it s a fine morning 
don t you

l want them lined up   
   just like a pretty little
chorus line 
look at that 
 l can t stand this guy 
 oh  lord 
yes  richmond  virginia

after he smells mine 
that s a shame about your horse
coming in last and all 
but l sure do love
that winning horse of mine  though 
l owe that boy a big kiss
when l see him 
why don t you give him some of your
cigarettes instead  lucky fuck 
hey  tyrell 
you pull infirmary duty this week 
how s my horse doing anyway 
dead 
hadley busted his head up pretty good 
doc had gone home for the night 
poor bastard lay there
till this morning 
by then  there wasn t nothing
we could do 
what was his name 
what d you say 
l was just wondering
if anyone knew his name 
what the fuck do you care  new fish 
doesn t fucking matter
what his name was  he s dead 
anybody come at you yet 
anybody get to you yet 
hey  we all need friends in here 
l could be a friend to you 
hard to get 
l like that 
andy kept pretty much
to himself at first 
i guess he had a lot on his mind   
   trying to adapt
to life on the inside 
wasn t until a month went by
before he opened his mouth   
   to say more than two words
to somebody 
as it turned out   
   that somebody was me 
l m andy dufresne 
wife killing banker 
why d you do it 
l didn t  since you ask 
you re going to fit right in 
everybody in here s innocent 
didn t you know that 
 what you in here for 
 didn t do it  lawyer fucked me 
rumor has it you re a real cold fish 
you think your shit smells
sweeter than most  ls that right 
what do you think 
to tell you the truth 
l haven t made up my mind 
l understand you re a man
that knows how to get things 
l m known to locate certain things
from time to time 
l wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer 
a rock hammer 
 what is it and why 
 what do you care 
for a toothbrush  l wouldn t ask 
l d quote a price 
but a toothbrush
is a non lethal object  isn t it 
fair enough 
a rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long 
 looks like a miniature pickax 
 pickax 
for rocks 
quartz 
and some mica  shale   
   limestone 
so 
so l m a rock hound 
at least l was in my old life 
l d like to be again 
or maybe you d like to sink your toy
into somebody s skull 
no  l have no enemies here 
no  wait a while 
word gets around 
the sisters have taken
quite a liking to you 
especially bogs 
don t suppose it would help if l
told them l m not homosexual 
neither are they 
you have to be human first 
they don t qualify 
bull queers take by force 
that s all they want or understand 
lf l were you  l d grow eyes
in the back of my head 
 thanks for the advice 
 well  that s free 
you understand my concern 
lf there s trouble 
l won t use the rock hammer 
then l d guess you want to escape 
tunnel under the wall  maybe 
what did l miss 
what s so funny 
you ll understand
when you see the rock hammer 
what s an item like this usually go for 
seven dollars in any rock and gem shop 
my normal markup s 20 percent 
but this is a specialty item 
risk goes up  price goes up 
let s make it an even 1 0 bucks 
ten it is 
waste of money  if you ask me 
why s that 
folks around this joint
love surprise inspections 
they find it  you re going to lose it 
lf they catch you  you don t know me 
mention my name  we never
do business again 
not for shoelaces or a stick of gum 
now you got that 
l understand 
thank you  mr    
red 
name s red 
why do they call you that 
maybe it s because l m lrish 
i could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby 
he had a quiet way about him   
   a walk and a talk thatjust
wasn t normal around here 
he strolled   
   like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world 
like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place 
i think it d be fair to say   
   i liked andy from the start 
let s go  some of us
got a schedule to keep 
move it  come on  move it 
how you doing 
how s the wife treating you 
andy was right 
i finally got thejoke 
it would take a man about 600 years   
   to tunnel under the wall
with one of these 
 book 
 not today 
book 
delivery for dufresne 
here s your book 
thanks 
we re running low on hexite 
get on back and fetch us up some 
this will blind you 
honey  hush 
that s it  you fight 
better that way 
i wish i could tell you
andy fought the good fight   
   and the sisters let him be 
i wish i could tell you that   
   but prison is no fairy tale world 
he never said who did it 
but we all knew 
things went on like that for a while 
prison life consists of routine   
   and then more routine 
every so often  andy would show up
with fresh bruises 
the sisters kept at him 
sometimes he was able
to fight them off 
sometimes not 
and that s how it went for andy 
that was his routine 
i do believe those first two years
were the worst for him 
and i also believe that
if things had gone on that way   
   this place would have
got the best of him 
but then  in the spring of 1949   
   the powers that be decided 
the roof of the license plate factory
needs resurfacing 
l need a dozen volunteers
for a week s work 
as you know   
   special detail carries with it
special privileges 
it was outdoor detail   
   and may is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors 
stay in line there 
more than a hundred men
volunteered for thejob 
wallace e  unger 
ellis redding 
wouldn t you know it 
me and some fellows i know
were among the names called 
andrew dufresne 
it only cost us
a pack of smokes per man 
i made my usual 20 percent  of course 
so this big shot lawyer
calls me long distance from texas 
l say    yeah   
he says    sorry to inform you 
but your brother just died   
 l m sorry to hear that 
 l m not  he was an asshole 
ran off years ago 
figured him for dead 
so this lawyer fellow says to me 
  he died a rich man    oil wells
and shit  close to a million bucks 
a million bucks 
 lncredible how lucky some assholes get 
 you going to see any of that 
thirty five thousand 
that s what he left me 
dollars 
that s great  that s like
winning the sweepstakes 
lsn t it 
dumb shit  what do you think
the government will do to me 
take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what 
poor byron 
terrible fucking luck  huh 
crying shame 
andy  are you nuts 
lkeep your eyes on your mop  man 
you ll pay some tax 
but you ll still end up  
yeah  maybe enough to buy
a new car  and then what 
l got to pay tax on the car  repair   
   maintenance  kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time 
then if you figure your tax wrong 
you pay out of your own pocket 
l tell you  uncle sam 
he puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it s purple 
 getting himself killed 
 lkeep tarring 
some brother 
shit 
mr  hadley   
   do you trust your wife 
oh  that s funny 
you ll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth 
what l mean is  do you think
she d go behind your back 
step aside  mert  this fucker s
having himself an accident 
he ll push him off 
lf you trust her  you can keep   
   that 35 000 
 what did you say 
 thirty five thousand 
all of it 
 every penny 
 you better start making sense 
lf you want to keep it 
give it to your wife 
the lrs allows a one time only gift
to your spouse for up to  60 000 
 bullshit  tax free 
 tax free 
lrs can t touch one cent 
you re that smart banker
that killed his wife 
why should l believe you 
so l can end up in here with you 
lt s legal  ask the lrs 
they ll say the same thing 
l feel stupid telling you this 
l m sure you would have investigated 
l don t need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat 
of course not  but you do need
someone to set it up for you 
that ll cost you  a lawyer 
a bunch of ball washing bastards 
l suppose l could set it up for you 
that would save you some money 
you get the forms  l ll prepare them   
   nearly free of charge 
l d only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers 
  coworkers    that s rich 
a man working outdoors
feels more like a man   
   if he can have a bottle of suds 
that s only my opinion   
   sir 
what are you jimmies staring at 
let s go  work 
and that s how it came to pass   
   that on the second to last
day of thejob   
   the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of  49   
   wound up sitting in a row
at 10 00 in the morning   
   drinking icy cold beer 
courtesy of the hardest screw   
   that ever walked a turn
at shawshank state prison 
drink up while it s cold  ladies 
the colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous 
we sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men 
we could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses 
we were the lords of all creation 
as for andy   
   he spent that break
hunkered in the shade   
   a strange little smile on his face   
   watching us drink his beer 
want a cold one 
no  thanks  l gave up drinking 
you could argue he done it
to curry favor with the guards 
or maybe make a few friends
among us cons 
me 
i think he did it
just to feel normal again   
   if only for a short while 
lking me 
 chess  now there s a game of kings 
 what 
civilized  strategic 
and a total fucking mystery 
l hate it 
let me teach you someday 
sure 
we could get a board together 
you re talking to the right man 
l can get things  right 
we might do business on a board 
and l ll carve the pieces myself 
one side in alabaster  one in soapstone 
what do you think 
l think it ll take years 
years l got 
what l don t have are the rocks 
pickings are pretty slim in the yard 
pebbles  mostly 
we re getting to be
kind of friends  aren t we 
yeah  l guess 
can l ask you something 
why d you do it 
l m innocent  red 
just like everybody else here 
what are you in for 
murder  same as you 
lnnocent 
only guilty man in shawshank 
where s the canary 
how did you know 
 how did i know what 
 so you don t know 
come 
this is where the canary is 
quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house  eh 
that s quite a   
   surprise 
wait  wait 
here she comes 
l like this part when she
does that shit with her hair 
l know  l ve seen it
three times this month 
gilda  are you decent 
me 
god  l love it 
l understand you re a man
that knows how to get things 
l m known to locate certain things
from time to time  what do you want 
 rita hayworth 
 what 
can you get her 
so this is johnny farrel 
i ve heard a lot about you 
 take a few weeks 
 weeks 
l don t have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now  sorry to say 
but l ll get her 
relax 
thanks 
 get out 
 l got to change reels 
l said fuck off 
ain t you going to scream 
let s get this over with 
he broke my fucking nose 
now   
   l m going to open my fly   
   and you ll swallow
what l give you to swallow 
then you ll swallow rooster s 
you broke his nose 
he ought to have
something to show for it 
you put it in my mouth 
you lose it 
no  you don t understand 
do that and l ll put all eight inches
of this in your ear 
all right  but you should know
that sudden  serious brain injury   
   causes the victim to bite down hard 
ln fact  l hear the bite reflex
is so strong   
   they have to pry
the victim s jaws open   
   with a crowbar 
where do you get this shit 
l read it 
you know how to read 
you ignorant fuck 
honey 
you shouldn t 
bogs didn t put anything
in andy s mouth 
and neither did his friends 
what they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life 
andy spent a month in the infirmary 
bogs spent a week in the hole 
time s up  bogs 
lt s your world  boss 
return to your cellblocks
for evening count 
all prisoners report for lock down 
what 
 where s he going 
 grab his ankles 
help 
two things never happened again
after that 
the sisters never
laid a finger on andy again 
and bogs would never walk again 
they transferred him
to a minimum security hospital upstate 
to my knowledge  he lived out
the rest of his days   
   drinking his food through a straw 
andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary 
sounds good to us 
l figure we owe him that much
for the beer 
the man likes to play chess 
let s get him some rocks 
guys 
l got one 
l got one  look 
heywood  that isn t soapstone 
and it ain t alabaster either 
what are you  a fucking geologist 
he s right  lt ain t 
 what the hell is it then

 bullshit 
 no  horseshit 
petrified 
damn 
despite a few hitches 
the boys came through in fine style 
and by the weekend
he was due back   
   we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture 
also got a big shipment in that week 
cigarettes   
   chewing gum   
   sipping whisky   
   playing cards with naked ladies

dekins blinked for a second   
   then he laughed
and actually shook andy s hand 
 my ass 
 shook his hand 
l tell you  l near soiled myself 
all he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk   
   he d have been
  mr  dufresne    if you please 
making a few friends 
l wouldn t say   friends   
l m a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning 
lt s a wonderful pet to have 
got you out of the laundry  though 
lt might do more than that 
how about expanding the library 
get some new books 
lf you ask for something 
ask for a pool table 
how do you expect to do that 
l mean   
   get new books in here 
  mr  dufresne  if you please   
l ll ask the warden for funds 
six wardens have been through here
in my tenure  and l ve learned   
   one immutable  universal truth 
not one born whose asshole   
   wouldn t pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds 
 the budget s stretched thin as it is 
 l see 
maybe l could write the state senate
and request funds from them 
they have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers  money for prisons 
more walls  more bars  more guards 
l d like to try  with permission 
a letter a week 
 they can t ignore me forever 
 sure can 
but you write your letters
if it makes you happy 
l ll even mail them for you 
how s that 
so andy started writing
a letter a week   
   just like he said 
and like norton said   
   andy got no answers 
the following april  he did tax returns
for half the guards at shawshank 
year after that  he did them all   
   including the warden s 
year after that  they
rescheduled the intramural season   
   to coincide with tax season 
the guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their w 2s 
so moresby prison   
   issued you a gun 
but you paid for it 
right  the holster too 
that s tax deductible 
you can write that off 
yes  sir 
andy was a regular cottage industry 
in fact  it got so busy at tax time 
he was allowed a staff 
could you hand me
a stack of 1 040s 
got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year  and that was fine by me 
and still  he kept
sending those letters 
lt s brooks 
watch the door 
please  brooks 
 calm the fuck down 
 stay back 
 stay back  goddamn it 
 what s going on 
one second he s fine 
then out come the knives 
we can talk about this  right 
there s nothing to talk about 
l ll cut his fucking throat 
what s he done to you 
lt s what they done 
l got no choice 
you won t hurt heywood 
we all know that 
 right  heywood 
 sure 
he s a friend of yours 
and brooks is a reasonable man 
right  guys 
so put the knife down 
look at me 
put the knife down 
look at his neck  for god s sake 
look at his neck  he s bleeding 
lt s the only way   
   they d let me stay 
this is crazy 
you don t want to do this 
put it  put it down 
take it easy 
you ll be all right 
him  what about me 
crazy old fool damn near cut my throat 
you ve had worse from shaving 
what did you do to set him off 
nothing 
l come in here to say farewell 
ain t you heard 
his parole s come through 
l just don t understand
what happened in there 
old man s crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse 
that s enough out of you 
 heard he had you shitting your pants 
 fuck you 
lknock it off 
brooks ain t no bug 
he s just institutionalized 
  lnstitutionalized    my ass 
the man s been in here 50 years 
heywood  50 years 
this is all he knows 
ln here  he s an important man   
   an educated man 
outside  he s nothing 
just a used up con
with arthritis in both hands 
probably couldn t get a library card
if he tried 
you know what l m trying to say 
l do believe
you re talking out of your ass 
you believe whatever you want 
but l tell you these walls are funny 
first you hate them 
then you get used to them 
enough time passes   
   you get so you depend on them 
that s   institutionalized   
shit 
 l could never get like that 
 oh  yeah 
wait till you ve been here
as long as brooks 
goddamn right 
they send you here for life   
   that s exactly what they take 
part that counts  anyway 
l can t take care of you no more  jake 
you go on now 
you re free 
you re free 
good luck  brooksie 
dear fellas 
i can t believe how fast things move
on the outside 
watch it  old timer 
want to get killed 
i saw an automobile once
when i was a kid   
   but now they re everywhere 
the world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry 
the parole board
got me into this halfway house   
   called   the brewer     
   and a job   
   bagging groceries at the food way 
it s hard work and i try to keep up   
   but my hands hurt most of the time 
make sure your man double bags 
last time  the bottom near came out 
make sure you double bag
like the lady says  understand 
yes  sir  surely will 
i don t think the store manager
likes me very much 
sometimes after work 
i go to the park and feed the birds 
i keep thinking   
   jake mightjust show up
and say hello 
but he never does 
i hope  wherever he is  he s doing okay
and making new friends 
i have trouble sleeping at night 
i have bad dreams like i m falling 
i wake up scared 
sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where i am 
maybe i should get a gun and rob
the food way so they d send me home 
i could shoot the manager while
i was at it  sort of like a bonus 
i guess i m too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore 
i don t like it here 
i m tired of being afraid all the time 
i ve decided   
   not to stay 
i doubt they ll kick up any fuss   
   not for an old crook like me 
brooks was here
  l doubt they ll kick up any fuss 
not for an old crook like me 
p s  tell heywood l m sorry
l put a knife to his throat 
no hard feelings  brooks   
he should have died in here 
what the fuck have you done 
lt s a goddamn mess 
l ll tell you that 
 what s all this 
 you tell me  they re addressed to you 
take it 
  dear mr  dufresne 
ln response to your inquiries   
   the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project   
this is  200 
  ln addition  the library district
has generously responded   
   with a donation of used books
and sundries 
we trust this will fill your needs 
we now consider the matter closed 
please stop sending us letters   
clear all this out
before the warden gets back 
yes  sir 
good for you  andy 
wow 
lt only took six years 
from now on  l ll write two
letters a week instead of one 
l believe you re crazy enough 
get this stuff out   
   like he said 
l ve got to pinch a loaf 
when l come back   
   this is all gone  all right 
do you hear that 
dufresne 
andy  let me out 
i have no idea to this day what those
two italian ladies were singing about 
truth is  i don t want to know 
some things are best left unsaid 
i like to think it was something
so beautiful   
   it can t be expressed in words   
   and makes your heart ache
because of it 
i tell you  those voices soared   
   higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream 
it was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage   
   and made those walls dissolve away 
and for the briefest of moments   
   every last man at shawshank
felt free 
it pissed the warden off
something awful 
open the door 
open it up 
dufresne  open this door 
turn that off 
l am warning you  turn that off 
you re mine now 
andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt 
on your feet 
 hey  look who s here 
 maestro 
you couldn t play something good  huh 
like hank williams 
they broke the door down
before l could take requests 
 was it worth two weeks 
 easiest time l ever did 
 no such thing as easy time in the hole 
 a week in the hole is like a year 
 damn straight 
 l had mr  mozart to keep me company 
so they let you tote
that record player down there  huh 
lt was in here 
ln here 
that s the beauty of music  they   
   can t get that from you 
haven t you ever felt
that way about music 
well  l played a mean harmonica
as a younger man 
lost interest in it  though 
didn t make much sense in here 
here s where it makes the most sense 
you need it so you don t forget 
forget 
forget that there are   
   places   
   in the world
that aren t made out of stone 
there s something   
   inside   
   that they can t get to   
   that they can t touch 
that s yours 
what are you talking about 
hope 
hope 
let me tell you something  my friend 
hope is a dangerous thing 
hope can drive a man insane 
lt s got no use on the inside 
you d better get used to that idea 
like brooks did 
sit down 
says here that you ve served
30 years of a life sentence 
you feel you ve been rehabilitated 
oh  yes  sir 
without a doubt 
l can honestly say l m a changed man 
no danger to society here 
god s honest truth 
absolutely rehabilitated 
aborted
thirty years 
jesus  when you say it like that    
you wonder where it went 
l wonder where 1 0 years went 
here 
a little parole rejection present 
go ahead and open it 
went through one of your competitors 
l hope you don t mind 
l wanted it to be a surprise 
lt s very pretty 
thank you 
you going to play it 
no 
not right now 
roll in 
new girlfriend at your aniversary red 
lights out 
andy was as good as his word 
he wrote two letters a week
instead of one 
in 1959  the state senate
finally clued in to the fact   
   they couldn t buy him off
withjust a  200 check 
appropriations committee
voted an annual payment of  500   
   just to shut him up 
and you d be amazed how far
andy could stretch it 
he made deals with book clubs 
charity groups 
he bought remaindered books
by the pound    
treasure island 
robert louis  
stevenson 
fiction  adventure 
what s next 
l got here auto repair   
   and soap carving 
trade skills and hobbies 
under   educational    behind you 
count of monte crisco 
that s   cristo    you dumb shit 
by alexandree   
   dum ass 
dumb ass 
dumb ass 
dumas  lknow what that s about 
you d like it 
lt s about a prison break 
we ought to file that
under   educational   too  oughtn t we 
the rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could 
by the year kennedy was shot   
   andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine   
   into the best prison library
in new england   
   complete with a fine selection
of hank williams 
that was also when warden norton   
   instituted his famous
  inside out   program 
you may remember reading about it 
it made the papers
and got his picture in look magazine 
lt s no free ride   
  but rather a genuine
progressive advance   
   in corrections and rehabilitation 
our inmates  properly supervised   
   will be put to work
outside these walls   
   performing all manner
of public service 
these men can learn the value   
   of an honest day s labor and
provide a service to the community   
   at a bare minimum of expense
to mr  and mrs  john q  taxpayer 
of course he didn t tell the press   
   that   bare minimum of expense  
is a fairly loose term 
there are 100 different ways
to skim off the top 
men  materials  you name it 
and oh  my lord 
how the money rolled in 
at this rate 
you ll put me out of business 
with this pool of slave labor 
you can underbid any contractor in town 
we re providing
a valuable community service 
that s fine for the papers 
but l ve got a family to feed 
we go back a long way 
l need this highway contract  l don t
get it and l go under  that s a fact 
you have some of this fine pie   
   my missus made for you 
you think about that 
l wouldn t worry too much
about this contract 
l already got my boys
committed elsewhere 
you be sure and thank maisie
for this fine pie 
and behind every shady deal   
   behind every dollar earned   
   there was andy  keeping the books 
two deposits 
maine national and new england first 
night drops as always  sir 
get my stuff to the laundry  two suits
for dry clean and a bag of whatnot 
lf they over starch my shirts again 
they ll hear from me 
how do l look 
 very nice 
 big charity to do up portland way 
governor will be there 
you want the rest of this 
woman can t bake worth shit 
thank you  sir 
he s got his fingers
in a lot of pies  from what l hear 
he s got scams you haven t even
dreamed of  lkickbacks on his kickbacks 
a river of dirty money
running through here 
sooner or later  he ll have to
explain where it came from 
that s where l come in 
l channel it  filter it  funnel it 
stocks  securities 
tax free municipals 
l send it out into the real world 
and when it comes back    
 clean as a virgin s honeypot  huh 
 cleaner 
by the time norton retires 
l ll have made him a millionaire 
lf they ever catch on  he ll wind up
in here wearing a number himself 
l thought you had
more faith in me than that 
l know you re good 
but all that paper leaves a trail 
now anybody gets curious 
fbl  lrs   
   whatever 
lt ll lead to somebody 
sure it is  but not to me 
and certainly not to the warden 
all right  who 
randall stevens 
who 
the   silent   silent partner 
lt s where the filtering
process starts 
they trace anything 
it ll just lead to him 
but who is he 
he s a phantom  an apparition 
second cousin to harvey the rabbit 
l conjured him   
   out of thin air 
he doesn t exist  except on paper 
you can t just make a person up 
sure you can 
if you know how the system works 
lt s amazing what you
can accomplish by mail 
mr  stevens has a birth certificate   
   driver s license  social security 
you re shitting me 
lf they trace any accounts 
they ll wind up chasing   
   a figment of my imagination 
well  l ll be damned 
did l say you were good 
shit  you are rembrandt 
the funny thing is   
   on the outside  l was an honest man 
straight as an arrow 
l had to come to prison to be a crook 
ever bother you 
l don t run the scams 
l just process the profits 
a fine line  maybe   
   but l also built that library   
   and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma 
why do you think
he lets me do all that 
lkeep you happy and doing the laundry 
money instead of sheets 
well  l work cheap 
that s the tradeoff 
tommy williams
came to shawshank in 1965   
   on a two year stretch for b and e 
that s breaking and entering to you 
cops caught him sneaking tv sets
out the back door of a jc penney 
young punk 
mr  rock  n  roll   
   cocky as hell 
come on  old boys 
moving like molasses 
making me look bad 
we liked him immediately 
l m backing out the door
and l got the tv like this 
a big old thing  l couldn t see shit 
then l hear this voice 
  freeze  kid  hands in the air   
l was standing there  holding onto
that tv  finally the voice says 
  you hear what l said  boy   
l say    yes  sir  l did 
but if l drop this  you get me
on destruction of property too   
you done some stretch
in cashman  right 
yeah  that was an easy piece of time 
let me tell you 
weekend furloughs 
work programs 
not like here 
sounds like you done time all over 
l ve been in and out since l was 1 3 
name it  chances are l ve been there 
perhaps you should try a new profession 
what l mean is   
   you re not a very good thief 
you should try something else 
yeah  what the hell
you know about it  capone 
what are you in for 
me 
a lawyer fucked me 
everybody s innocent in here 
don t you know that 
as it turned out  tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl 
maybe he thought of them
on the streets   
   or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy 
whatever it was   
   something lit a fire
under that boy s ass 
thought l might try for
my high school equivalency 
hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that 
l don t waste time with losers  tommy 
l ain t no goddamn loser 
 you mean that 
 yeah 
you really mean that 
yes  sir  l do 
good  because if we do this   
   we do it all the way 
a hundred percent  nothing half assed 
thing is  see   
   l don t read so good 
  well   
you don t read   
   so well 
we ll get to that 
so andy took tommy under his wing 
started walking him through his abc s 
tommy took to it pretty well too 
boy found brains he never knew he had 
before long  andy started him
on his course requirements 
he really liked the kid 
gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap 
but that wasn t the only reason 
prison time is slow time 
so you do what you can to keep going 
some fellas collect stamps 
others build matchstick houses 
andy built a library 
now he needed a new project 
tommy was it 
it was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks 
the same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall 
in prison   
   a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied 
by 1966  right about the time tommy
was getting ready to take his exams   
   it was lovely raquel 
time 
well 
well  it s for shit 
l wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit 
lt s probably not that bad 
l didn t get a thing right 
lt might as well have been in chinese 
let s see how the score comes out 
l ll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out 
two points  right there 
there s your goddamn score 
goddamn cats crawling up trees 
5 times 5 is 25    
fuck this place 
fuck it 
l feel bad 
l let him down 
that s crap  kid 
he s proud of you 
we re old friends 
l know him as good as anybody 
smart fellow  ain t he 
smart as they come 
he was a banker on the outside 
what s he in here for anyway 
murder 
the hell  you say 
you wouldn t think it
to look at the guy 
caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro  greased them both 
what 
about four years ago   
   l was in thomaston
on a two to three stretch 
l stole a car 
lt was a dumb fuck thing to do 
about six months left to go   
   l get a new cellmate in 
elmo blatch 
big  twitchy fucker 
lkind of roomie you pray you don t get 
you know what l m saying 
six to twelve  armed burglary 
said he pulled hundreds of jobs 
hard to believe  high strung as he was 
you cut a loud fart  he jumped three feet 
talked all the time too  that s
the other thing  he never shut up 
places he d been in   
   jobs he d pulled  women he fucked 
even people he killed 
people who   gave him shit   
that s how he put it 
so one night  like a joke   
   l say to him 
  elmo  who did you kill   
so he says 
l got me this job one time 
busing tables at a country club   
   so l could case all these big
rich pricks that come in 
so l pick out this guy   
   go in one night   
   and do his place 
he wakes up   
   and gives me shit 
so l killed him 
him and this tasty bitch he was with 
and that s the best part 
she s fucking this prick  see   
   this golf pro 
but she s married to some other guy 
some hotshot banker 
and he s the one they pinned it on 
l have to say that s
the most amazing story l ever heard 
what amazes me most
is you d be taken in by it 
sir 
lt s obvious this fellow williams
is impressed with you 
he hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up 
he s young  not terribly bright 
lt s not surprising he wouldn t
know what a state he put you in 
sir  he s telling the truth 
let s say for the moment
this blatch does exist 
you think he d just fall to his knees
and cry    yes  l did it  l confess 
by the way 
add a life term to my sentence   
with tommy s testimony 
l can get a new trial 
that s assuming blatch is still there 
chances are  he d be released by now 
they d have his last known address 
lt s a chance  isn t it 
how can you be so obtuse 
what 
what did you call me 
obtuse  ls it deliberate 
you re forgetting yourself 
the country club
will have his old timecards 
records  w 2s with his name on them 
lf you want to indulge this fantasy 
it s your business 
don t make it mine 
this meeting is over 
lf l got out  l d never mention
what happens here 
l d be as indictable as you
for laundering that money 
don t ever mention money to me 
you son of a bitch 
not in this office   
   not anywhere 
get in here  now 
l just wanted to put you at ease 
that s all 
solitary  a month 
what s wrong with you 
get him out of here 
this is my chance to get out 
lt s my life  understand  
get him out 
a month in the hole 
that s the longest stretch
l ever heard of 
lt s all my fault 
bullshit 
you didn t pull the trigger
or convict him 
are you saying andy is innocent 
l mean  for real innocent 
lt looks that way 
sweet jesus 
how long has he been here now 
1 947  what is that 
nineteen years 
 williams  thomas 
 yeah  over here 
what you got 
board of education 
that son of a bitch mailed it 
you going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt 
thumb up my butt sounds better 
skeets  come on 
give me that  you shithead 
floyd  come on 
will you throw that away  please 
well  shit 
the kid passed  c   average 
thought you d like to know 
warden wants to talk 
out here 
that s what the man said 
warden 
l m asking you to keep this conversation
just between us 
l feel awkward enough as it is 
we got a situation here 
l think you can appreciate that 
yes  sir 
l sure can 
l tell you  son  this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out 
lt s got me up nights 
that s the truth 
the right thing to do   
   sometimes it s hard to know
what that is 
do you understand 
l need your help  son 
lf l m going to move on this   
   there can t be
the least little shred of doubt 
l have to know   
   if what you told dufresne
was the truth 
yes  sir 
absolutely 
would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury   
   with your hand on the good book   
   and take an oath
before almighty god himself 
just give me that chance 
that s what l thought 
l m sure by now you ve heard 
terrible thing 
a man that young   
   less than a year to go 
trying to escape 
broke captain hadley s heart
to shoot him 
truly  it did 
we just have to put it behind us 
move on 
l m done 
everything stops 
get someone else to run your scams 
nothing stops 
nothing 
or you will do
the hardest time there is 
no more protection from the guards 
l ll pull you out of that 1  bunk hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites 
you ll think you ve been
fucked by a train 
and the library 
gone 
sealed off  brick by brick 
we ll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard 
they ll see the flames for miles 
we ll dance around it like wild lnjuns 
you understand me  catching my drift 
or am l being obtuse 
give him another month
to think about it 
my wife used to say
l m a hard man to know 
like a closed book 
complained about it all the time 
she was beautiful 
god  l loved her 
l didn t know how
to show it  that s all 
l killed her  red 
l didn t pull the trigger   
   but l drove her away 
that s why she died  because of me   
   the way l am 
that don t make you a murderer 
bad husband  maybe 
feel bad about it if you want 
but you didn t pull the trigger 
no  l didn t 
somebody else did 
and l wound up in here 
bad luck  l guess 
lt floats around 
lt s got to land on somebody 
lt was my turn  that s all 
l was in the path of the tornado 
l just didn t expect the storm
would last as long as it has 
think you ll ever get out of here 
me 
yeah 
one day  when l got
a long  white beard   
   and two or three marbles
rolling around upstairs 
l tell you where l d go 
zihuatanejo 
say what 
zihuatanejo 
lt s in mexico 
a little place on the pacific ocean 
you know what the mexicans say
about the pacific 
they say it has no memory 
that s where l want to live
the rest of my life 
a warm place with no memory 
open up a little hotel   
   right on the beach 
buy some worthless old boat   
   and fix it up new 
take my guests out   
   charter fishing 
zihuatanejo 
ln a place like that  l could use
a man that knows how to get things 
l don t think l could make it
on the outside 
l been in here most of my life 
l m an institutional man now 
just like brooks was 
you underestimate yourself 
l don t think so 
ln here l m the guy who can get things
for you  sure  but   
   outside all you need

whatever mistakes l made

mexico is way down there
and you re in here   
   and that s the way it is 
yeah  right 
that s the way it is

   or get busy dying 
lf you ever get out of here 
do me a favor 
sure  andy  anything 
there s a big hayfield up near buxton 
you know where buxton is 
 a lot of hayfields up there 
 one in particular 
lt s got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end 
lt s like something
out of a robert frost poem 
lt s where l asked my wife to marry me 
we went there for a picnic   
   and made love under that oak   
   and l asked and she said yes 
promise me  red 
lf you ever get out   
   find that spot 
at the base of that wall  there s a rock
that has no earthly business in maine 
piece of black  volcanic glass 
something s buried under it
l want you to have 
what  andy

that s fine during the day 
but at night he s all alone 
oh  lord

rope 
six feet long 
and you gave it to him

you re thick as thieves  you are 
he must have said something 
no  sir  warden 
not a word 
lord  it s a miracle 
man vanished like a fart in the wind 
nothing left   
   but some damn rocks
on a windowsill 
and that cupcake on the wall 
let s ask her 
maybe she knows 
what say there  fuzzy britches 
feel like talking 
guess not 
why should she be any different 
this is a conspiracy 
that s what this is 
one big  damn conspiracy 
and everyone s in on it 
lncluding her 
in 1966   
   andy dufresne escaped   
   from shawshank prison 
all they found
was a muddy set ofprison clothes   
   a bar of soap   
   and an old rock hammer   
   damn near worn down to the nub 
i had thought it d take a man 600 years
to tunnel through the wall with it 
old andy did it in less than 20 
oh  andy loved geology 
i imagine it appealed to his
meticulous nature 
an ice age here   
   million years
of mountain building there 
geology is the study
ofpressure and time 
that s all it takes  really 
pressure   
   and time 
that and a big goddamn poster 
like i said   
   in prison  a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied 
seems andy s favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard   
   a handful at a time 
i guess after tommy was killed   
   andy decided
he d been here long enough 
lickety split 
l want to get home 
l m just about finished  sir 
three deposits tonight 
andy did like he was told 
buffed those shoes
to a high mirror shine 
the guards simply didn t notice 
neither did i 
i mean  seriously   
   how often do you really look
at a man s shoes 
andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards   
   of shit smelling foulness
i can t even imagine 
or maybe ijust don t want to 
five hundred yards 
that s the length
of five football fields 
just shy of half a mile 
the next morning  right about the time
raquel was spilling her secret   
   a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before   
   strolled into
the maine national bank 
until that moment 
he didn t exist 
he had all the proper id   
   driver s license  birth certificate 
social security card    
and the signature
was a spot on match 
l must say l m sorry
to be losing your business 
l hope you ll enjoy living abroad 
thank you 
l m sure l will 
here s your cashier s check  sir 
will there be anything else 
please 
would you add this
to your outgoing mail 
l d be happy to 
good day  sir 
mr  stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the portland area that morning 
all told  he blew town   
   with better than  370 000
of warden norton s money 
severance pay for 19 years 
good morning  portland daily bugle 
corruption 
death in shawshank 
dear director 
you had right 
it is help in him 
byron hadley 
you have the right to remain silent 
lf you give up this right  anything you
say can be held against you in court 
i wasn t there to see  but i hear
byron hadley sobbed like a girl   
   when they took him away 
norton had no intention
of going that quietly 
samuel norton 
we have a warrant
for your arrest  open up 
open the door 
l m not sure which key 
make it easy on yourself  norton 
i like to think the last thing
that went through his head   
   other than that bullet   
   was to wonder how the hell
andy dufresne ever got the best of him 
not long after the warden
deprived us of his company   
   i got a postcard in the mail 
it was blank 
but the postmark said   
   fort hancock  texas 
fort hancock   
   right on the border 
that s where andy crossed 
when i picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down   
   it always makes me laugh 
andy dufresne   
   who crawled through
a river of shit   
   and came out clean
on the other side 
andy dufresne   
   headed for the pacific 
hadley s got him
by the throat  right 
he says    l believe this boy s
about to have himself an accident   
those of us who knew him best
talk about him often 
i swear  the stuff he pulled    
  my friends could use
a couple of beers   
and he got it 
sometimes it makes me sad  though   
   andy being gone 
i have to remind myself that
some birds aren t meant to be caged 
their feathers arejust too bright 
and when they fly away   
   the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice 
but still   
   the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they re gone 
i guess ijust miss my friend 
please sit down 
ellis boyd redding   
   your files say you ve served
40 years of a life sentence 
you feel you ve been rehabilitated 
rehabilitated 
well  now  let me see 
l don t have any idea
what that means 
lt means you re ready
to rejoin society  
l know what you think it means  sonny 
to me it s just a made up word 
a politician s word so that   
   young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie   
   and have a job 
what do you really want to know 
am l sorry for what l did 
well  are you 
there s not a day goes by
l don t feel regret 
not because l m in here
or because you think l should 
l look back on the way l was then   
   a young   
   stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime 
l want to talk to him 
l want to try
and talk some sense to him 
tell him the way things are 
but l can t 
that kid s long gone   
   and this old man is all that s left 
l got to live with that 
rehabilitated 
lt s just a bullshit word 
so you go on and stamp your forms 
sonny  and stop wasting my time 
because to tell you the truth   
   l don t give a shit 
aproved
brooks was here
here you go  miss 
restroom break 
you don t need to ask me every time
you need to go take a piss  just go 
forty years i ve been asking
permission to piss 
i can t squeeze a drop without say so 
there s a harsh truth to face 
no way i m going to make it
on the outside 
all i do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole   
   so maybe they d send me back 
terrible thing  to live in fear 
brooks hatlen knew it 
knew it all too well 
all i want is to be back
where things make sense 
where i won t have to be afraid
all the time 
only one thing stops me 
a promise i made to andy 
there it is 
much obliged  sir 
dear red 
if you re reading this 
you ve gotten out   
   and if you ve come this far 
maybe you d come a bit further 
you remember the name
of the town  don t you 
zihuatanejo 
i could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels 
i ll keep an eye out for you 
and the chessboard ready 
remember  red   
   hope is a good thing   
   maybe the best of things 
and no good thing ever dies 
i will be hoping
that this letter finds you   
   and finds you well 
your friend   
   andy 
  get busy living   
   or get busy dying    
that s goddamn right 
red was here too 
for the second time in my life   
   i m guilty of committing a crime 
parole violation 
of course i doubt they ll toss up
any roadblocks for that 
not for an old crook like me 
fort hancock  texas  please 
i find i m so excited i can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head 
i think it s the excitement
only a free man can feel 
a free man at the start
of a longjourney   
   whose conclusion is uncertain 
i hope i can make it across the border 
i hope to see my friend
