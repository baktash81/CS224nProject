your wife the night she was murdered
lt was very bitter
she said she was glad l knew
that she hated all the sneaking around
and she said that she wanted
a divorce in reno
what was your response
l told her l would not grant one
lll see you in hell
before l see you in reno
those were your words
according to your neighbors
lf they say so
l really dont remember
l was upset
what happened after you argued
with your wife
she packed a bag
she packed a bag to go
and stay with mr quentin
glenn quentin golfpro
at the snowden hills country club
whom you had discovered
was your wifes lover
did you follow her
l went to a few bars first
later l drove to his house
to confront them they werent home
l parked in the turnout
and waited
with what intention
im not sure
i was confused drunk
i think
mostly i wanted to scare them
when they arrived you went up
to the house and murdered them
l was sobering up
l got back in the car
and l drove home to sleep it off
along the way l threw my gun
into the royal river
lve been very clear on this point
l get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning
and finds your wife in bed
with her lover
riddled with 38caliber bullets
does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence or is it just me
yes it does
yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river
before the murders took place
thats very convenient
lts the truth
the police dragged that river for
three days and nary a gun was found
so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets
taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims
and that also
is very convenient
lsnt it mr dufresne
since l am innocent of this crime
l find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found
ladies and gentlemen youve heard
all the evidence
we have the accused at the scene
of the crime we have footprints
bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints
a broken bourbon bottle
likewise with fingerprints
and most of all
we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover
lying dead in each others arms
they had sinned
but was their crime so great
as to merit a death sentence
while you think about that
think about this
a revolver holds six bullets not eight
l submit that this was not
a hotblooded crime of passion
that at least could be understood
if not condoned
no
this was revenge
of a much more brutal
coldblooded nature consider this
four bullets per victim
not six shots fired but eight
that means that he fired
the gun empty
and then stopped to reload
so that he could shoot
each of them again
an extra bullet per lover
right in the head
you strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man mr dufresne
lt chills my blood just to look at you
by the power vested in me
by the state of maine
l hereby order you to serve
two life sentences backtoback
one for each of your victims
so be it
sit
we see youve served
20 years of a life sentence
yes sir
you feel youve been rehabilitated
yes sir absolutely sir
l mean l learned my lesson
l can honestly say
that lm a changed man
lm no longer a danger to society
thats gods honest truth
aborted
hey red
howd it go
same old shit different day
yeah l know how you feel
lm up for rejection next week
yeah l got rejected last week
lt happens
hey red bump me a deck
get out of my face man

im the guy who can get it for you
cigarettes a bag of reefer
if thats your thing
bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kids high school graduation
damn near anything within reason
yes sir
im a regular sears and roebuck
so when andy dufresne
came to me in 1949
and asked me to smuggle
rita hayworth into the prison for him
i told him no problem
andy came to shawshank prison
in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging
on the outside hed been vice president
of a large portland bank
good work for a man so young
hey red

heap of maggot shit in all my life

old life blown away

nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it
most new fish come close to madness
the first night
somebody always breaks down crying
happens every time

its as good a thing
to bet on as any i guess
i had my money on andy dufresne

chorus line

thats a shame about your horse

but l sure do love
that winning horse of mine though
l owe that boy a big kiss
when l see him
why dont you give him some of your
cigarettes instead lucky fuck
hey tyrell
you pull infirmary duty this week
hows my horse doing anyway
dead
hadley busted his head up pretty good
doc had gone home for the night
poor bastard lay there
till this morning
by then there wasnt nothing
we could do
what was his name
whatd you say
l was just wondering
if anyone knew his name
what the fuck do you care new fish
doesnt fucking matter
what his name was hes dead
anybody come at you yet
anybody get to you yet
hey we all need friends in here
l could be a friend to you
hard to get
l like that
andy kept pretty much
to himself at first
i guess he had a lot on his mind
trying to adapt
to life on the inside
wasnt until a month went by
before he opened his mouth
to say more than two words
to somebody
as it turned out
that somebody was me
lm andy dufresne
wifekilling banker
whyd you do it
l didnt since you ask
youre going to fit right in
everybody in heres innocent
didnt you know that
what you in here for
didnt do it lawyer fucked me
rumor has it youre a real cold fish
you think your shit smells
sweeter than most ls that right
what do you think
to tell you the truth
l havent made up my mind
l understand youre a man
that knows how to get things
lm known to locate certain things
from time to time
l wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer
a rock hammer
what is it and why
what do you care
for a toothbrush l wouldnt ask
ld quote a price
but a toothbrush
is a nonlethal object isnt it
fair enough
a rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long
looks like a miniature pickax
pickax
for rocks
quartz
and some mica shale
limestone
so
so lm a rock hound
at least l was in my old life
ld like to be again
or maybe youd like to sink your toy
into somebodys skull
no l have no enemies here
no wait a while
word gets around
the sisters have taken
quite a liking to you
especially bogs
dont suppose it would help if l
told them lm not homosexual
neither are they
you have to be human first
they dont qualify
bull queers take by force
thats all they want or understand
lf l were you ld grow eyes
in the back of my head
thanks for the advice
well thats free
you understand my concern
lf theres trouble
l wont use the rock hammer
then ld guess you want to escape
tunnel under the wall maybe
what did l miss
whats so funny
youll understand
when you see the rock hammer
whats an item like this usually go for
seven dollars in any rockandgem shop
my normal markups 20 percent
but this is a specialty item
risk goes up price goes up
lets make it an even 1 0 bucks
ten it is
waste of money if you ask me
whys that
folks around this joint
love surprise inspections
they find it youre going to lose it
lf they catch you you dont know me
mention my name we never
do business again
not for shoelaces or a stick of gum
now you got that
l understand
thank you mr
red
names red
why do they call you that
maybe its because lm lrish
i could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby
he had a quiet way about him
a walk and a talk thatjust
wasnt normal around here
he strolled
like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world
like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place
i think itd be fair to say
i liked andy from the start
lets go some of us
got a schedule to keep
move it come on move it
how you doing
hows the wife treating you
andy was right
i finally got thejoke
it would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall
with one of these
book
not today
book
delivery for dufresne
heres your book
thanks
were running low on hexite
get on back and fetch us up some
this will blind you
honey hush
thats it you fight
better that way
i wish i could tell you
andy fought the good fight
and the sisters let him be
i wish i could tell you that
but prison is no fairytale world
he never said who did it
but we all knew
things went on like that for a while
prison life consists of routine
and then more routine
every so often andy would show up
with fresh bruises
the sisters kept at him
sometimes he was able
to fight them off
sometimes not
and thats how it went for andy
that was his routine
i do believe those first two years
were the worst for him
and i also believe that
if things had gone on that way
this place would have
got the best of him
but then in the spring of 1949
the powers that be decided
the roof of the licenseplate factory
needs resurfacing
l need a dozen volunteers
for a weeks work
as you know
special detail carries with it
special privileges
it was outdoor detail
and may is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors
stay in line there
more than a hundred men
volunteered for thejob
wallace e unger
ellis redding
wouldnt you know it
me and some fellows i know
were among the names called
andrew dufresne
it only cost us
a pack of smokes per man
i made my usual 20 percent of course
so this bigshot lawyer
calls me longdistance from texas
l say yeah
he says sorry to inform you
but your brother just died
lm sorry to hear that
lm not he was an asshole
ran off years ago
figured him for dead
so this lawyer fellow says to me
he died a rich man oil wells
and shit close to a million bucks
a million bucks
lncredible how lucky some assholes get
you going to see any of that
thirtyfive thousand
thats what he left me
dollars
thats great thats like
winning the sweepstakes
lsnt it
dumb shit what do you think
the government will do to me
take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what
poor byron
terrible fucking luck huh
crying shame
andy are you nuts
lkeep your eyes on your mop man
youll pay some tax
but youll still end up
yeah maybe enough to buy
a new car and then what
l got to pay tax on the car repair
maintenance kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time
then if you figure your tax wrong
you pay out of your own pocket
l tell you uncle sam
he puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till its purple
getting himself killed
lkeep tarring
some brother
shit
mr hadley
do you trust your wife
oh thats funny
youll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth
what l mean is do you think
shed go behind your back
step aside mert this fuckers
having himself an accident
hell push him off
lf you trust her you can keep
that 35000
what did you say
thirtyfive thousand
all of it
every penny
you better start making sense
lf you want to keep it
give it to your wife
the lrs allows a onetimeonly gift
to your spouse for up to 60000
bullshit taxfree
taxfree
lrs cant touch one cent
youre that smart banker
that killed his wife
why should l believe you
so l can end up in here with you
lts legal ask the lrs
theyll say the same thing
l feel stupid telling you this
lm sure you would have investigated
l dont need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat
of course not but you do need
someone to set it up for you
thatll cost you a lawyer
a bunch of ballwashing bastards
l suppose l could set it up for you
that would save you some money
you get the forms lll prepare them
nearly free of charge
ld only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers
coworkers thats rich
a man working outdoors
feels more like a man
if he can have a bottle of suds
thats only my opinion
sir
what are you jimmies staring at
lets go work
and thats how it came to pass
that on the secondtolast
day of thejob
the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of 49
wound up sitting in a row
at 1000 in the morning
drinking icycold beer
courtesy of the hardest screw
that ever walked a turn
at shawshank state prison
drink up while its cold ladies
the colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous
we sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men
we could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses
we were the lords of all creation
as for andy
he spent that break
hunkered in the shade
a strange little smile on his face
watching us drink his beer
want a cold one
no thanks l gave up drinking
you could argue he done it
to curry favor with the guards
or maybe make a few friends
among us cons
me
i think he did it
just to feel normal again
if only for a short while
lking me
chess now theres a game of kings
what
civilized strategic
and a total fucking mystery
l hate it
let me teach you someday
sure
we could get a board together
youre talking to the right man
l can get things right
we might do business on a board
and lll carve the pieces myself
one side in alabaster one in soapstone
what do you think
l think itll take years
years l got
what l dont have are the rocks
pickings are pretty slim in the yard
pebbles mostly
were getting to be
kind of friends arent we
yeah l guess
can l ask you something
whyd you do it
lm innocent red
just like everybody else here
what are you in for
murder same as you
lnnocent
only guilty man in shawshank
wheres the canary
how did you know
how did i know what
so you dont know

this is where the canary is
quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house eh

surprise
wait wait

l like this part when she
does that shit with her hair
l know lve seen it
three times this month
gilda are you decent

l understand youre a man
that knows how to get things
lm known to locate certain things
from time to time what do you want
rita hayworth

ive heard a lot about you
take a few weeks
weeks
l dont have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now sorry to say

and youll swallow
what l give you to swallow
then youll swallow roosters
you broke his nose
he ought to have
something to show for it
you put it in my mouth
you lose it
no you dont understand
do that and lll put all eight inches
of this in your ear
all right but you should know
that sudden serious brain injury
causes the victim to bite down hard
ln fact l hear the bite reflex
is so strong
they have to pry
the victims jaws open
with a crowbar
where do you get this shit
l read it
you know how to read
you ignorant fuck
honey
you shouldnt
bogs didnt put anything
in andys mouth
and neither did his friends
what they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life
andy spent a month in the infirmary
bogs spent a week in the hole
times up bogs
lts your world boss
return to your cellblocks
for evening count
all prisoners report for lock down
what
wheres he going
grab his ankles
help
two things never happened again
after that
the sisters never
laid a finger on andy again
and bogs would never walk again
they transferred him
to a minimumsecurity hospital upstate
to my knowledge he lived out
the rest of his days
drinking his food through a straw
andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary
sounds good to us
l figure we owe him that much
for the beer
the man likes to play chess
lets get him some rocks
guys
l got one
l got one look
heywood that isnt soapstone
and it aint alabaster either
what are you a fucking geologist
hes right lt aint
what the hell is it then
lts a horse apple
bullshit
no horseshit
petrified
damn
despite a few hitches
the boys came through in fine style
and by the weekend
he was due back
we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture
also got a big shipment in that week
cigarettes
chewing gum
sipping whisky
playing cards with naked ladies
on them you name it
and of course the most important item
rita hayworth herself

on your feet

pleased to see you reading this
any favorite passages
watch ye therefore
for ye know not
when the master
of the house cometh
mark 1 335
lve always liked that one

john chapter 8 verse 1 2
l hear youre good with numbers
how nice
man should have a skill
explain this
lts called a rock blanket
lts for shaping and polishing rocks
a little hobby of mine
lts pretty clean
some contraband here
but nothing to get in a twist over
l cant say l approve of this
but l suppose
exceptions can be made
lock them up
l almost forgot
ld hate to deprive you of this
salvation lies within
yes sir
tossing cells wasjust an excuse
truth is
norton wanted to size andy up
my wife made that in church group
very nice sir
you enjoy working the laundry
no sir not especially
perhaps we can find something more
befitting a man of your education
hey jake
wheres brooks
l thought l heard you out here
lve been reassigned to you
l know they told me
aint that a kick in the head
well lll give you the dime tour
come on
well here she is
the shawshank prison library
national geographics
readers digest condensed books
and louis lamour
look magazine
erle stanley gardners
every evening l load up the cart
and make my rounds
l enter the names
on this clipboard here
easy peasy japanesey
any questions
how long have you been librarian
l come here in 05
and they made me librarian in 1 9 1 2
and have you ever had an assistant
no not much to it really
why me why now
l dont know
but itd be nice to have
some company down here
thats him
thats the one
lm dekins
l was thinking
about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids educations
l see
why dont we have a seat
and talk it over
do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil
thanks
so
mister dekins
and then andy says mr dekins
do you want your sons
to go to harvard or yale
he didnt say that
as god as my witness
dekins blinked for a second
then he laughed
and actually shook andys hand
my ass
shook his hand
l tell you l near soiled myself
all he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk
hed have been
mr dufresne if you please
making a few friends
l wouldnt say friends
lm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning
lts a wonderful pet to have
got you out of the laundry though
lt might do more than that
how about expanding the library
get some new books
lf you ask for something
ask for a pool table
how do you expect to do that
l mean
get new books in here
mr dufresne if you please
lll ask the warden for funds
six wardens have been through here
in my tenure and lve learned
one immutable universal truth
not one born whose asshole
wouldnt pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds
the budgets stretched thin as it is
l see
maybe l could write the state senate
and request funds from them
they have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers money for prisons
more walls more bars more guards
ld like to try with permission
a letter a week
they cant ignore me forever
sure can
but you write your letters
if it makes you happy
lll even mail them for you
hows that
so andy started writing
a letter a week
just like he said
and like norton said
andy got no answers
the following april he did tax returns
for half the guards at shawshank
year after that he did them all
including the wardens
year after that they
rescheduled the intramural season
to coincide with tax season
the guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their w2s
so moresby prison
issued you a gun
but you paid for it
right the holster too
thats taxdeductible
you can write that off
yes sir
andy was a regular cottage industry
in fact it got so busy at tax time
he was allowed a staff
could you hand me
a stack of 1 040s
got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year and that was fine by me
and still he kept
sending those letters
lts brooks
watch the door
please brooks
calm the fuck down
stay back
stay back goddamn it
whats going on
one second hes fine
then out come the knives
we can talk about this right
theres nothing to talk about
lll cut his fucking throat
whats he done to you
lts what they done
l got no choice
you wont hurt heywood
we all know that
right heywood
sure
hes a friend of yours
and brooks is a reasonable man
right guys
so put the knife down
look at me
put the knife down
look at his neck for gods sake
look at his neck hes bleeding
lts the only way
theyd let me stay
this is crazy
you dont want to do this
put it put it down
take it easy
youll be all right
him what about me
crazy old fool damn near cut my throat
youve had worse from shaving
what did you do to set him off
nothing
l come in here to say farewell
aint you heard
his paroles come through
l just dont understand
what happened in there
old mans crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse
thats enough out of you
heard he had you shitting your pants
fuck you
lknock it off
brooks aint no bug
hes just institutionalized
lnstitutionalized my ass
the mans been in here 50 years
heywood 50 years
this is all he knows
ln here hes an important man
an educated man
outside hes nothing
just a usedup con
with arthritis in both hands
probably couldnt get a library card
if he tried
you know what lm trying to say
l do believe
youre talking out of your ass
you believe whatever you want
but l tell you these walls are funny
first you hate them
then you get used to them
enough time passes
you get so you depend on them
thats institutionalized
shit
l could never get like that
oh yeah
wait till youve been here
as long as brooks
goddamn right
they send you here for life
thats exactly what they take
part that counts anyway
l cant take care of you no more jake
you go on now
youre free
youre free
good luck brooksie
dear fellas
i cant believe how fast things move
on the outside
watch it oldtimer
want to get killed
i saw an automobile once
when i was a kid
but now theyre everywhere
the world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry
the parole board
got me into this halfway house
called the brewer
and a job
bagging groceries at the foodway
its hard work and i try to keep up
but my hands hurt most of the time
make sure your man doublebags
last time the bottom near came out
make sure you doublebag
like the lady says understand
yes sir surely will
i dont think the store manager
likes me very much
sometimes after work
i go to the park and feed the birds
i keep thinking
jake mightjust show up
and say hello
but he never does
i hope wherever he is hes doing okay
and making new friends
i have trouble sleeping at night
i have bad dreams like im falling
i wake up scared
sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where i am
maybe i should get a gun and rob
the foodway so theyd send me home
i could shoot the manager while
i was at it sort of like a bonus
i guess im too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore
i dont like it here
im tired of being afraid all the time
ive decided
not to stay
i doubt theyll kick up any fuss
not for an old crook like me
brooks was here
l doubt theyll kick up any fuss
not for an old crook like me
ps tell heywood lm sorry
l put a knife to his throat
no hard feelings brooks
he should have died in here
what the fuck have you done
lts a goddamn mess
lll tell you that
whats all this
you tell me theyre addressed to you
take it
dear mr dufresne
ln response to your inquiries
the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project
this is 200
ln addition the library district
has generously responded
with a donation of used books
and sundries
we trust this will fill your needs
we now consider the matter closed
please stop sending us letters
clear all this out
before the warden gets back
yes sir
good for you andy
wow
lt only took six years
from now on lll write two
letters a week instead of one
l believe youre crazy enough
get this stuff out
like he said
lve got to pinch a loaf
when l come back
this is all gone all right
do you hear that
dufresne
andy let me out
i have no idea to this day what those
two italian ladies were singing about
truth is i dont want to know
some things are best left unsaid
i like to think it was something
so beautiful
it cant be expressed in words
and makes your heart ache
because of it
i tell you those voices soared
higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream
it was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage
and made those walls dissolve away
and for the briefest of moments
every last man at shawshank
felt free
it pissed the warden off
something awful
open the door
open it up
dufresne open this door
turn that off
l am warning you turn that off
youre mine now
andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt
on your feet
hey look whos here
maestro
you couldnt play something good huh
like hank williams
they broke the door down
before l could take requests
was it worth two weeks
easiest time l ever did
no such thing as easy time in the hole
a week in the hole is like a year
damn straight
l had mr mozart to keep me company
so they let you tote
that record player down there huh
lt was in here
ln here
thats the beauty of music they
cant get that from you
havent you ever felt
that way about music
well l played a mean harmonica
as a younger man
lost interest in it though
didnt make much sense in here
heres where it makes the most sense
you need it so you dont forget
forget
forget that there are
places
in the world
that arent made out of stone
theres something
inside
that they cant get to
that they cant touch
thats yours
what are you talking about
hope
hope
let me tell you something my friend
hope is a dangerous thing
hope can drive a man insane
lts got no use on the inside
youd better get used to that idea
like brooks did
sit down
says here that youve served
30 years of a life sentence
you feel youve been rehabilitated
oh yes sir
without a doubt
l can honestly say lm a changed man
no danger to society here
gods honest truth
absolutely rehabilitated
aborted
thirty years
jesus when you say it like that
you wonder where it went
l wonder where 1 0 years went
here
a little parole rejection present
go ahead and open it
went through one of your competitors
l hope you dont mind
l wanted it to be a surprise
lts very pretty
thank you
you going to play it
no
not right now
roll in
new girlfriend at your aniversary red
lights out
andy was as good as his word
he wrote two letters a week
instead of one
in 1959 the state senate
finally clued in to the fact
they couldnt buy him off
withjust a 200 check
appropriations committee
voted an annual payment of 500
just to shut him up
and youd be amazed how far
andy could stretch it
he made deals with book clubs
charity groups
he bought remaindered books
by the pound
treasure island
robert louis
stevenson
fiction adventure
whats next
l got here auto repair
and soap carving
trade skills and hobbies
under educational behind you
count of monte crisco
thats cristo you dumb shit
by alexandree
dumass
dumb ass
dumb ass
dumas lknow what thats about
youd like it
lts about a prison break
we ought to file that
under educational too oughtnt we
the rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could
by the year kennedy was shot
andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine
into the best prison library
in new england
complete with a fine selection
of hank williams
that was also when warden norton
instituted his famous
inside out program
you may remember reading about it
it made the papers
and got his picture in look magazine
lts no free ride
but rather a genuine
progressive advance
in corrections and rehabilitation
our inmates properly supervised
will be put to work
outside these walls
performing all manner
of public service
these men can learn the value
of an honest days labor and
provide a service to the community
at a bare minimum of expense
to mr and mrs john q taxpayer
of course he didnt tell the press
that bare minimum of expense
is a fairly loose term
there are 100 different ways
to skim off the top
men materials you name it
and oh my lord
how the money rolled in
at this rate
youll put me out of business
with this pool of slave labor
you can underbid any contractor in town
were providing
a valuable community service
thats fine for the papers
but lve got a family to feed
we go back a long way
l need this highway contract l dont
get it and l go under thats a fact
you have some of this fine pie
my missus made for you
you think about that
l wouldnt worry too much
about this contract
l already got my boys
committed elsewhere
you be sure and thank maisie
for this fine pie
and behind every shady deal
behind every dollar earned
there was andy keeping the books
two deposits
maine national and new england first
night drops as always sir
get my stuff to the laundry two suits
for dryclean and a bag of whatnot
lf they overstarch my shirts again
theyll hear from me
how do l look
very nice
big charity todo up portland way
governor will be there
you want the rest of this
woman cant bake worth shit
thank you sir
hes got his fingers
in a lot of pies from what l hear
hes got scams you havent even
dreamed of lkickbacks on his kickbacks
a river of dirty money
running through here
sooner or later hell have to
explain where it came from
thats where l come in
l channel it filter it funnel it
stocks securities
taxfree municipals
l send it out into the real world
and when it comes back
clean as a virgins honeypot huh
cleaner
by the time norton retires
lll have made him a millionaire
lf they ever catch on hell wind up
in here wearing a number himself
l thought you had
more faith in me than that
l know youre good
but all that paper leaves a trail
now anybody gets curious
fbl lrs
whatever
ltll lead to somebody
sure it is but not to me
and certainly not to the warden
all right who
randall stevens
who
the silent silent partner
lts where the filtering
process starts
they trace anything
itll just lead to him
but who is he
hes a phantom an apparition
second cousin to harvey the rabbit
l conjured him
out of thin air
he doesnt exist except on paper
you cant just make a person up
sure you can
if you know how the system works
lts amazing what you
can accomplish by mail
mr stevens has a birth certificate
drivers license social security
youre shitting me
lf they trace any accounts
theyll wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination
well lll be damned
did l say you were good
shit you are rembrandt
the funny thing is
on the outside l was an honest man
straight as an arrow
l had to come to prison to be a crook
ever bother you
l dont run the scams
l just process the profits
a fine line maybe
but l also built that library
and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma
why do you think
he lets me do all that
lkeep you happy and doing the laundry
money instead of sheets
well l work cheap
thats the tradeoff
tommy williams
came to shawshank in 1965
on a twoyear stretch for b and e
thats breaking and entering to you
cops caught him sneaking tv sets
out the back door of a jc penney
young punk
mr rock n roll
cocky as hell
come on old boys
moving like molasses
making me look bad
we liked him immediately
lm backing out the door
and l got the tv like this
a big old thing l couldnt see shit
then l hear this voice
freeze kid hands in the air
l was standing there holding onto
that tv finally the voice says
you hear what l said boy
l say yes sir l did
but if l drop this you get me
on destruction of property too
you done some stretch
in cashman right
yeah that was an easy piece of time
let me tell you
weekend furloughs
work programs
not like here
sounds like you done time all over
lve been in and out since l was 1 3
name it chances are lve been there
perhaps you should try a new profession
what l mean is
youre not a very good thief
you should try something else
yeah what the hell
you know about it capone
what are you in for
me
a lawyer fucked me
everybodys innocent in here
dont you know that
as it turned out tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl
maybe he thought of them
on the streets
or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy
whatever it was
something lit a fire
under that boys ass
thought l might try for
my high school equivalency
hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that
l dont waste time with losers tommy
l aint no goddamn loser
you mean that
yeah
you really mean that
yes sir l do
good because if we do this
we do it all the way
a hundred percent nothing halfassed
thing is see
l dont read so good
well
you dont read
so well
well get to that
so andy took tommy under his wing
started walking him through his abcs
tommy took to it pretty well too
boy found brains he never knew he had
before long andy started him
on his course requirements
he really liked the kid
gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap
but that wasnt the only reason
prison time is slow time
so you do what you can to keep going
some fellas collect stamps
others build matchstick houses
andy built a library
now he needed a new project
tommy was it
it was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks
the same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall
in prison
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied
by 1966 right about the time tommy
was getting ready to take his exams
it was lovely raquel
time
well
well its for shit
l wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit
lts probably not that bad
l didnt get a thing right
lt might as well have been in chinese
lets see how the score comes out
lll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out
two points right there
theres your goddamn score
goddamn cats crawling up trees
5 times 5 is 25
fuck this place
fuck it
l feel bad
l let him down
thats crap kid
hes proud of you
were old friends
l know him as good as anybody
smart fellow aint he
smart as they come
he was a banker on the outside
whats he in here for anyway
murder
the hell you say
you wouldnt think it
to look at the guy
caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro greased them both
what
about four years ago
l was in thomaston
on a twotothree stretch
l stole a car
lt was a dumbfuck thing to do
about six months left to go
l get a new cellmate in
elmo blatch
big twitchy fucker
lkind of roomie you pray you dont get
you know what lm saying
sixtotwelve armed burglary
said he pulled hundreds of jobs
hard to believe highstrung as he was
you cut a loud fart he jumped three feet
talked all the time too thats
the other thing he never shut up
places hed been in
jobs hed pulled women he fucked
even people he killed
people who gave him shit
thats how he put it
so one night like a joke
l say to him
elmo who did you kill
so he says
l got me this job one time
busing tables at a country club
so l could case all these big
rich pricks that come in
so l pick out this guy
go in one night
and do his place
he wakes up
and gives me shit
so l killed him
him and this tasty bitch he was with
and thats the best part
shes fucking this prick see
this golf pro
but shes married to some other guy
some hotshot banker
and hes the one they pinned it on
l have to say thats
the most amazing story l ever heard
what amazes me most
is youd be taken in by it
sir
lts obvious this fellow williams
is impressed with you
he hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up
hes young not terribly bright
lts not surprising he wouldnt
know what a state he put you in
sir hes telling the truth
lets say for the moment
this blatch does exist
you think hed just fall to his knees
and cry yes l did it l confess
by the way
add a life term to my sentence
with tommys testimony
l can get a new trial
thats assuming blatch is still there
chances are hed be released by now
theyd have his last known address
lts a chance isnt it
how can you be so obtuse
what
what did you call me
obtuse ls it deliberate
youre forgetting yourself
the country club
will have his old timecards
records w2s with his name on them
lf you want to indulge this fantasy
its your business
dont make it mine
this meeting is over
lf l got out ld never mention
what happens here
ld be as indictable as you
for laundering that money
dont ever mention money to me
you son of a bitch
not in this office
not anywhere
get in here now
l just wanted to put you at ease
thats all
solitary a month
whats wrong with you
get him out of here
this is my chance to get out
lts my life understand
get him out
a month in the hole
thats the longest stretch
l ever heard of
lts all my fault
bullshit
you didnt pull the trigger
or convict him
are you saying andy is innocent
l mean for real innocent
lt looks that way
sweet jesus
how long has he been here now
1 947 what is that
nineteen years
williams thomas
yeah over here
what you got
board of education
that son of a bitch mailed it
you going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt
thumb up my butt sounds better
skeets come on
give me that you shithead
floyd come on
will you throw that away please
well shit
the kid passed c  average
thought youd like to know
warden wants to talk
out here
thats what the man said
warden
lm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us
l feel awkward enough as it is
we got a situation here
l think you can appreciate that
yes sir
l sure can
l tell you son this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out
lts got me up nights
thats the truth
the right thing to do
sometimes its hard to know
what that is
do you understand
l need your help son
lf lm going to move on this
there cant be
the least little shred of doubt
l have to know
if what you told dufresne
was the truth
yes sir
absolutely
would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury
with your hand on the good book
and take an oath
before almighty god himself
just give me that chance
thats what l thought
lm sure by now youve heard
terrible thing
a man that young
less than a year to go
trying to escape
broke captain hadleys heart
to shoot him
truly it did
we just have to put it behind us
move on
lm done
everything stops
get someone else to run your scams
nothing stops
nothing
or you will do
the hardest time there is
no more protection from the guards
lll pull you out of that 1 bunk hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites
youll think youve been
fucked by a train
and the library
gone
sealed off brick by brick
well have us a little
book barbecue in the yard
theyll see the flames for miles
well dance around it like wild lnjuns
you understand me catching my drift
or am l being obtuse
give him another month
to think about it
my wife used to say
lm a hard man to know
like a closed book
complained about it all the time
she was beautiful
god l loved her
l didnt know how
to show it thats all
l killed her red
l didnt pull the trigger
but l drove her away
thats why she died because of me
the way l am
that dont make you a murderer
bad husband maybe
feel bad about it if you want
but you didnt pull the trigger
no l didnt
somebody else did
and l wound up in here
bad luck l guess
lt floats around
lts got to land on somebody
lt was my turn thats all
l was in the path of the tornado
l just didnt expect the storm
would last as long as it has
think youll ever get out of here
me
yeah
one day when l got
a long white beard
and two or three marbles
rolling around upstairs
l tell you where ld go
zihuatanejo
say what
zihuatanejo
lts in mexico
a little place on the pacific ocean
you know what the mexicans say
about the pacific
they say it has no memory
thats where l want to live
the rest of my life
a warm place with no memory
open up a little hotel
right on the beach
buy some worthless old boat
and fix it up new
take my guests out
charter fishing
zihuatanejo
ln a place like that l could use
a man that knows how to get things
l dont think l could make it
on the outside
l been in here most of my life
lm an institutional man now
just like brooks was
you underestimate yourself
l dont think so
ln here lm the guy who can get things
for you sure but
outside all you need
is the yellow pages
hell l wouldnt know
where to begin
pacific ocean
shit
scare me to death
something that big
not me
l didnt shoot my wife
and l didnt shoot her lover
whatever mistakes l made
lve paid for them and then some
that hotel that boat
l dont think thats too much to ask
you shouldnt be doing this to yourself
this is just shitty pipe dreams
mexico is way down there
and youre in here
and thats the way it is
yeah right
thats the way it is
lts down there and lm in here
l guess it comes down
to a simple choice
get busy living
or get busy dying
lf you ever get out of here
do me a favor
sure andy anything
theres a big hayfield up near buxton
you know where buxton is
a lot of hayfields up there
one in particular
lts got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end
lts like something
out of a robert frost poem
lts where l asked my wife to marry me
we went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak
and l asked and she said yes
promise me red
lf you ever get out
find that spot
at the base of that wall theres a rock
that has no earthly business in maine
piece of black volcanic glass
somethings buried under it
l want you to have
what andy
whats buried under there
youll have to pry it up
to see
no lm telling you the guy is
hes talking funny
lm really worried about him
lets keep an eye on him
thats fine during the day
but at night hes all alone
oh lord
what
andy come down
to the loading dock today
he asked me for a length of rope
rope
six feet long
and you gave it to him
sure why wouldnt l
jesus heywood
how was l supposed to know
remember brooks hatlen
andy would never do that
never
l dont know
every man has his breaking point
licketysplit
want to get home
just about finished sir
three deposits tonight

and shine my shoes
l want them looking like mirrors
yes sir
lts good having you back
place wasnt the same without you

l see you two all the time
youre thick as thieves you are
he must have said something
no sir warden

lord its a miracle
man vanished like a fart in the wind
nothing left
but some damn rocks
on a windowsill
and that cupcake on the wall
lets ask her
maybe she knows
what say there fuzzybritches
feel like talking
guess not
why should she be any different
this is a conspiracy
thats what this is
one big damn conspiracy
and everyones in on it
lncluding her
in 1966
andy dufresne escaped
from shawshank prison
all they found
was a muddy set ofprison clothes
a bar of soap
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub
i had thought itd take a man 600 years
to tunnel through the wall with it
old andy did it in less than 20
oh andy loved geology
i imagine it appealed to his
meticulous nature
an ice age here
million years
of mountain building there
geology is the study
ofpressure and time
thats all it takes really
pressure
and time
that and a big goddamn poster
like i said
in prison a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied
seems andys favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard
a handful at a time
i guess after tommy was killed
andy decided
hed been here long enough
licketysplit
l want to get home
lm just about finished sir
three deposits tonight
andy did like he was told
buffed those shoes
to a high mirrorshine
the guards simply didnt notice
neither did i
i mean seriously
how often do you really look
at a mans shoes
andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards
of shitsmelling foulness
i cant even imagine
or maybe ijust dont want to
five hundred yards
thats the length
of five football fields
just shy of half a mile
the next morning right about the time
raquel was spilling her secret
a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before
strolled into
the maine national bank
until that moment
he didnt exist
he had all the proper id
drivers license birth certificate
social security card
and the signature
was a spoton match
l must say lm sorry
to be losing your business
l hope youll enjoy living abroad
thank you
lm sure l will
heres your cashiers check sir
will there be anything else
please
would you add this
to your outgoing mail
ld be happy to
good day sir
mr stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the portland area that morning
all told he blew town
with better than 370000
of warden nortons money
severance pay for 19 years
good morning portland daily bugle
corruption
death in shawshank
dear director
you had right
it is help in him
byron hadley
you have the right to remain silent
lf you give up this right anything you
say can be held against you in court
i wasnt there to see but i hear
byron hadley sobbed like a girl
when they took him away
norton had no intention
of going that quietly
samuel norton
we have a warrant
for your arrest open up
open the door
lm not sure which key
make it easy on yourself norton
i like to think the last thing
that went through his head
other than that bullet
was to wonder how the hell
andy dufresne ever got the best of him
not long after the warden
deprived us of his company
i got a postcard in the mail
it was blank
but the postmark said
fort hancock texas
fort hancock
right on the border
thats where andy crossed
when i picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down
it always makes me laugh
andy dufresne
who crawled through
a river of shit
and came out clean
on the other side
andy dufresne
headed for the pacific
hadleys got him
by the throat right
he says l believe this boys
about to have himself an accident
those of us who knew him best
talk about him often
i swear the stuff he pulled
my friends could use
a couple of beers
and he got it
sometimes it makes me sad though
andy being gone
i have to remind myself that
some birds arent meant to be caged
their feathers arejust too bright
and when they fly away
the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice
but still
the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that theyre gone
i guess ijust miss my friend
please sit down
ellis boyd redding
your files say youve served
40 years of a life sentence
you feel youve been rehabilitated
rehabilitated
well now let me see
l dont have any idea
what that means
lt means youre ready
to rejoin society
l know what you think it means sonny
to me its just a madeup word
a politicians word so that
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie
and have a job
what do you really want to know
am l sorry for what l did
well are you
theres not a day goes by
l dont feel regret
not because lm in here
or because you think l should
l look back on the way l was then
a young
stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime
l want to talk to him
l want to try
and talk some sense to him
tell him the way things are
but l cant
that kids long gone
and this old man is all thats left
l got to live with that
rehabilitated
lts just a bullshit word
so you go on and stamp your forms
sonny and stop wasting my time
because to tell you the truth
l dont give a shit
aproved
brooks was here
here you go miss
restroom break
you dont need to ask me every time
you need to go take a piss just go
forty years ive been asking
permission to piss
i cant squeeze a drop without sayso
theres a harsh truth to face
no way im going to make it
on the outside
all i do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole
so maybe theyd send me back
terrible thing to live in fear
brooks hatlen knew it
knew it all too well
all i want is to be back
where things make sense
where i wont have to be afraid
all the time
only one thing stops me
a promise i made to andy
there it is
much obliged sir
dear red
if youre reading this
youve gotten out
and if youve come this far
maybe youd come a bit further
you remember the name
of the town dont you
zihuatanejo
i could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels
ill keep an eye out for you
and the chessboard ready
remember red
hope is a good thing
maybe the best of things
and no good thing ever dies
i will be hoping
that this letter finds you
and finds you well
your friend
andy
get busy living
or get busy dying
thats goddamn right
red was here too
for the second time in my life
im guilty of committing a crime
parole violation
of course i doubt theyll toss up
any roadblocks for that
not for an old crook like me
fort hancock texas please
i find im so excited i can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head
i think its the excitement
only a free man can feel
a free man at the start
of a longjourney
whose conclusion is uncertain
i hope i can make it across the border
i hope to see my friend
