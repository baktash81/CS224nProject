if the general s here 
lance corporals
blake and schofield  sir 
  which one of you is blake 
  sir 
you have a brother 
a lieutenant in the 2nd devons 
yes  sir 
joseph blake  is he    
alive  as far as i know 
and with your help
i d like to keep it that way 
sanders tells me you re good
with maps  is that true 
good enough  sir 
so 
we are here 
the 2nd devons are advancing here 
how long will it take you
to get there 
i don t understand  sir 
sir  that land is held
by the germans 
germans have gone 
don t get your hopes up 
it appears to be a strategic withdrawal 
they seem to have created a new line 
nine miles back here  by the looks of it 
colonel mackenzie is in command
of the 2nd 
he sent word yesterday morning
he was going after the retreating germans 
he is convinced
he has them on the run  
that if he can break their lines now 
he will turn the tide 
he is wrong 
colonel mackenzie has not seen
these aerials of the enemy s new line 
come round here  gentlemen 
three miles deep  field fortifications 
defences  artillery 
the like of which we ve
never seen before 
the 2nd are due to attack the line
shortly after dawn tomorrow 
they have no idea
what they are in for 
and we can t warn them  
as a parting gift 
the enemy cut
all our telegram lines 
your orders are to get to the 2nd
at croisilles wood  one mile
south east of the town of ecoust 
deliver this to colonel mackenzie 
it is a direct order to call off
tomorrow morning s attack 
if you don t 
it will be a massacre 
we would lose two battalions 
1600 men  your brother among them 
you think you can get there in time 
  yes  sir 
  any questions 
  no  sir 
  good 
over to you  lieutenant 
supplies  gentlemen 
map  torches  grenades 
and a couple of little treats 
leave immediately  take this trench west 
up on sauchiehall street 
then north west
on paradise alley at the front 
continue along the front line
until you find the yorks 
give this note to major stevenson 
he s holding the line
at the shortest span
of no man s land 
you ll cross there 
it will be daylight  sir 
they ll see us 
there s no need to be concerned 
you should meet no resistance 
sir  is it just us 
 down to gehenna or up to the throne 
he travels the fastest who travels alone  
  wouldn t you say  lieutenant 
  yes  sir  i would 
good luck 
blake   let s talk about this
for a minute 
why 
blake 
we just need to think about it 
there s nothing to think about 
he s my big brother 
we should at least wait
until it s dark 
erinmore said to leave immediately 
erinmore s never seen
no man s land 
we won t make it 10 yards 
if we just wait 
you heard him 
he said the boche have gone 
is that why he gave us grenades 
  watch where you re going 
  sorry 
all i m saying is that we wait 
yes  you would say that 
because he s not your brother  is it 
look  the last time i was told
the germans were gone  it didn t end well 
you don t know  blake 
you weren t there 
excuse me  excuse me 
you re going up a down trench
you bloody idiots 
orders of the general  sir 
alright  say the boche have gone 
nine miles will take us  what  six hours 
eight at the very most 
so  we ve got time
to wait until the sun sets   
it s enemy territory  we ve got
no idea what we re walking into 
blake  if we re not clever about this 
no one will get to your brother 
i will 
we re here 
this is the front line 
now we need to find the yorks 
  watch who you re shoving 
  get out of the way then 
who the fuck do you think you are 
pushing wounded soldiers around 
let go of me 
arsehole knocked down our sergeant 
the man s fucking wounded 
i m sorry  alright  i m sorry 
  we re on commission 
  just let me through 
  orders from the general 
  just let me through 
get out of the way 
right  just watch
where you re going 
it s bloody quiet 
was it like this before thiepval 
i don t remember 
you don t remember the somme 
not really 
well  you did alright out of it 
at least wear your ribbon 
don t have it anymore 
what  you lost your medal 
it s down  boys 
stay low 
god s sake  careful there 
you re stepping on the dead 
that s our sergeant 
be better washing them out of this
dugout with a bloody hose 
do you know where the yorks are 
the next bend you ll be standing
on top of half of them 
shot to hell two nights ago 
yorks 
yes  corp 
where s major stevenson 
was killed a couple of nights ago 
corporal 
lieutenant leslie has command 
where can we find him 
next dug out 
here 
sir  lieutenant leslie  sir 
what is it 
we have a message
from general erinmore 
  are you our relief 
  no  sir 
then  when the fucking hell
are they due 
we don t know  sir 
but we ve got orders to cross here 
  that is the german front line 
  we know  sir 
if you ll just take the letter 
settle a bet  what day is it 
friday 
friday  well  well  well 
none of us was right 
this idiot thought it was tuesday 
sorry  sir 
are they out of their fucking minds 
one slow night  and the brass think
the hun have just gone home 
do you think they re wrong  sir 
we lost an officer
and three men two nights ago 
they were shot to bits
patching up wire 
we dragged two of them back here 
needn t have bothered 
sir  the general is sure
the enemy have withdrawn 
there are aerials
of the new line   
shut up  we ve fought and died
over every inch of this fucking place 
now they suddenly give us miles 
it s a trap 
but  chin up 
there s a medal in it for sure 
nothing like a scrap of ribbon
to cheer up a widow 
alright 
where s the nearest
way through  sir 
our wire s a mess 
but there is a path through  of sorts 
rushworth  let him look 
straight ahead  to the left 
past the dead horses 
there s a gap directly behind them 
useful  because if it s dark
you follow the stench 
when you get to the second wire 
look out for the bowing chap 
there s small break
just beside him 
the german line
is a 150 odd yards after that 
watch out for the craters 
they re deeper than they look 
you fall in  there s no getting out 
this way 
wake up  kilgour 
bloody waste of space 
any cover  sir 
anywhere to jump off from 
no  the sap trench
was blown to hell weeks ago 
it s full of bodies anyway 
your best bet is to pop over here 
if you do get shot 
try to make it back to the wire 
we won t come after you 
not until it s dark 
and  if by some fucking miracle
you do make it  send up a flare 
don t have any  sir 
well  get him one  kilgour 
make yourself useful 
yes  sir 
 through this holy unction
may the lord pardon thee
all faults or whatever sins
thou hast committed  
i do hate losing these to the hun 
so  when they start shooting at you 
could you be so kind as to
throw it back  there s a good chap 
cheerio 
you sure 
yes 
age before beauty 
you alright 
look for cover 
sap trench 
alright 
stay still 
they re ours 
keep going  we re half way 
there s a gap in the wire 
sco   
there  that s the front line 
fuck me  they really have gone 
your hand alright 
put it through an effing german 
patch it up 
you ll be wanking again
in no time 
wrong hand 
they re not long gone 
no good 
blocked 
this might be a way through 
jesus

some other bloody idiot

i thought they were going to send us back
up the line  or for food  or something 
i thought it was going to be
something easy  alright 
i never thought it would be this 
so  do you want to go back 
just fire the fucking flare 
up yours  lieutenant 
do you know where we are 
ecoust is directly south east 
and if we keep that bearing 
we should make it 
come on then 
look at that 
they destroyed their own guns 
they destroyed
their own trenches too 
what do you mean 
i think they wanted us to go that way 
they wanted to bury us 
bastard rats 
hey  did you hear that story
about wilko 
how he lost his ear 
i m not in the mood 
keep your eyes on the trees 
top of the ridge 
bet he told you it was shrapnel 
what was it then 
well  you know his girl s
a hairdresser  right 
and he was moaning about the lack of
bathing facilities when he wrote to her  
remember those rancid
jakes at arras 
anyway  she sends him over
this  hair oil  
smells sweet  like golden syrup 
wilko loves the smell 
but he doesn t want to
cart it around in his pack  so
he slathers it all over his barnet 
goes to sleep 
and in the middle of the night
he wakes up 
and a rat is sitting on his shoulder
licking the oil off of his head 
wilko panics  and he jumps up 
and when he does  
the rat bites clean through
his fucking ear and runs off with it 
oh  he made a hell of a fuss 
yelling  screaming 
the best of it was he could put
so much bloody oil on himself
that he couldn t wash it off 
he was like a magnet 
rats left us alone 
but they couldn t get enough of him 
poor bastard 
heading back home 
i wonder what they saw 
watch the ridge lines 
well  that s your medal
sorted then 
what do you mean 
 lance corporal blake showed
unusual valour in rescuing
a comrade from certain death 
blah  blah  blah 
you reckon 
i do 
well  that d be nice 
since you lost yours 
i didn t lose mine 
  what happened to it  then 
  why do you care 
why do you not 
i swapped it with a french captain 
you swapped it  for what 
bottle of wine 
  what did you do that for 
  i was thirsty 
what a waste 
you should ve taken it home
with you  you should ve
given it to your family 
men have died for that 
if i got a medal  i d take it back home 
why didn t you just take it home   
look it s just a bit of bloody tin 
it doesn t make you special 
it doesn t make any difference to anyone 
yes  it does 
and it s not just a bit of tin 
it s got a ribbon on it 
i hated going home  i hated it 
when i knew i couldn t stay 
when i knew i had to leave 
and they might never see me 
jesus 
they chopped them all down 
cherries 
lamberts 
they might be dukes 
hard to tell when they aren t in fruit
