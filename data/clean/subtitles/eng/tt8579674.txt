blake and schofield sir
which one of you is blake
sir
you have a brother
a lieutenant in the 2nd devons
yes sir
joseph blake is he
alive as far as i know
and with your help
id like to keep it that way
sanders tells me youre good
with maps is that true
good enough sir
so
we are here
the 2nd devons are advancing here
how long will it take you
to get there
i dont understand sir
sir that land is held
by the germans
germans have gone
dont get your hopes up
it appears to be a strategic withdrawal
they seem to have created a new line
nine miles back here by the looks of it
colonel mackenzie is in command
of the 2nd
he sent word yesterday morning
he was going after the retreating germans
he is convinced
he has them on the run
that if he can break their lines now
he will turn the tide
he is wrong
colonel mackenzie has not seen
these aerials of the enemys new line
come round here gentlemen
three miles deep field fortifications
defences artillery
the like of which weve
never seen before
the 2nd are due to attack the line
shortly after dawn tomorrow
they have no idea
what they are in for
and we cant warn them
as a parting gift
the enemy cut
all our telegram lines
your orders are to get to the 2nd
at croisilles wood one mile
southeast of the town of ecoust
deliver this to colonel mackenzie
it is a direct order to call off
tomorrow mornings attack
if you dont
it will be a massacre
we would lose two battalions
1600 men your brother among them
you think you can get there in time
yes sir
any questions
no sir
good
over to you lieutenant
supplies gentlemen
map torches grenades
and a couple of little treats
leave immediately take this trench west
up on sauchiehall street
then northwest
on paradise alley at the front
continue along the front line
until you find the yorks
give this note to major stevenson
hes holding the line
at the shortest span
of no mans land
youll cross there
it will be daylight sir
theyll see us
theres no need to be concerned
you should meet no resistance
sir is it just us
down to gehenna or up to the throne
he travels the fastest who travels alone
wouldnt you say lieutenant
yes sir i would
good luck
blake  lets talk about this
for a minute
why
blake
we just need to think about it
theres nothing to think about
hes my big brother
we should at least wait
until its dark
erinmore said to leave immediately
erinmores never seen
no mans land
we wont make it 10 yards
if we just wait
you heard him
he said the boche have gone
is that why he gave us grenades
watch where youre going
sorry
all im saying is that we wait
yes you would say that
because hes not your brother is it
look the last time i was told
the germans were gone it didnt end well
you dont know blake
you werent there
excuse me excuse me
youre going up a down trench
you bloody idiots
orders of the general sir
alright say the boche have gone
nine miles will take us what six hours
eight at the very most
so weve got time
to wait until the sun sets
its enemy territory weve got
no idea what were walking into
blake if were not clever about this
no one will get to your brother
i will
were here
this is the front line
now we need to find the yorks
watch who youre shoving
get out of the way then
who the fuck do you think you are
pushing wounded soldiers around
let go of me
arsehole knocked down our sergeant
the mans fucking wounded
im sorry alright im sorry
were on commission
just let me through
orders from the general
just let me through
get out of the way
right just watch
where youre going
its bloody quiet
was it like this before thiepval
i dont remember
you dont remember the somme
not really
well you did alright out of it
at least wear your ribbon
dont have it anymore
what you lost your medal
its down boys
stay low
gods sake careful there
youre stepping on the dead
thats our sergeant
be better washing them out of this
dugout with a bloody hose
do you know where the yorks are
the next bend youll be standing
on top of half of them
shot to hell two nights ago
yorks
yes corp
wheres major stevenson
was killed a couple of nights ago
corporal
lieutenant leslie has command
where can we find him
next dugout
here
sir lieutenant leslie sir
what is it
we have a message
from general erinmore
are you our relief
no sir
then when the fucking hell
are they due
we dont know sir
but weve got orders to cross here
that is the german front line
we know sir
if youll just take the letter
settle a bet what day is it
friday
friday well well well
none of us was right
this idiot thought it was tuesday
sorry sir
are they out of their fucking minds
one slow night and the brass think
the hun have just gone home
do you think theyre wrong sir
we lost an officer
and three men two nights ago
they were shot to bits
patching up wire
we dragged two of them back here
neednt have bothered
sir the general is sure
the enemy have withdrawn
there are aerials
of the new line
shut up weve fought and died
over every inch of this fucking place
now they suddenly give us miles
its a trap
but chin up
theres a medal in it for sure
nothing like a scrap of ribbon
to cheer up a widow
alright
wheres the nearest
way through sir
our wires a mess
but there is a path through of sorts
rushworth let him look
straight ahead to the left
past the dead horses
theres a gap directly behind them
useful because if its dark
you follow the stench
when you get to the second wire
look out for the bowing chap
theres small break
just beside him
the german line
is a 150 odd yards after that
watch out for the craters
theyre deeper than they look
you fall in theres no getting out
this way
wake up kilgour
bloody waste of space
any cover sir
anywhere to jump off from
no the sap trench
was blown to hell weeks ago
its full of bodies anyway
your best bet is to pop over here
if you do get shot
try to make it back to the wire
we wont come after you
not until its dark
and if by some fucking miracle
you do make it send up a flare
dont have any sir
well get him one kilgour
make yourself useful
yes sir
through this holy unction
may the lord pardon thee
all faults or whatever sins
thou hast committed
i do hate losing these to the hun
so when they start shooting at you
could you be so kind as to
throw it back theres a good chap
cheerio
you sure
yes
age before beauty
you alright
look for cover
sap trench
alright
stay still
theyre ours
keep going were halfway

up the line or for food or something
i thought it was going to be
something easy alright
i never thought it would be this
so do you want to go back
just fire the fucking flare
up yours lieutenant
do you know where we are
ecoust is directly southeast
and if we keep that bearing
we should make it
come on then
look at that
they destroyed their own guns

their own trenches too

i think they wanted us to go that way
they wanted to bury us
bastard rats
hey did you hear that story
about wilko
how he lost his ear
im not in the mood
keep your eyes on the trees
top of the ridge
bet he told you it was shrapnel
what was it then
well you know his girls
a hairdresser right
and he was moaning about the lack of
bathing facilities when he wrote to her
remember those rancid
jakes at arras
anyway she sends him over
this hair oil
smells sweet like golden syrup
wilko loves the smell
but he doesnt want to
cart it around in his pack so
he slathers it all over his barnet
goes to sleep
and in the middle of the night
he wakes up
and a rat is sitting on his shoulder
licking the oil off of his head
wilko panics and he jumps up
and when he does
the rat bites clean through
his fucking ear and runs off with it
oh he made a hell of a fuss
yelling screaming
the best of it was he could put
so much bloody oil on himself
that he couldnt wash it off
he was like a magnet
rats left us alone
but they couldnt get enough of him
poor bastard
heading back home
i wonder what they saw
watch the ridge lines
well thats your medal
sorted then
what do you mean
lance corporal blake showed
unusual valour in rescuing
a comrade from certain death
blah blah blah
you reckon
i do
well thatd be nice
since you lost yours
i didnt lose mine
what happened to it then
why do you care
why do you not
i swapped it with a french captain
you swapped it for what
bottle of wine
what did you do that for
i was thirsty
what a waste
you shouldve taken it home
with you you shouldve
given it to your family
men have died for that
if i got a medal id take it back home
why didnt you just take it home
look its just a bit of bloody tin
it doesnt make you special
it doesnt make any difference to anyone
yes it does
and its not just a bit of tin
its got a ribbon on it
i hated going home i hated it
when i knew i couldnt stay
when i knew i had to leave
and they might never see me
jesus
they chopped them all down
cherries
lamberts
they might be dukes
hard to tell when they arent in fruit
