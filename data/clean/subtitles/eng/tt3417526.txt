people murmuring
voiceover okay welcome cern
fact control room
atlas experiment
atlas one four large experiments
going lhc
large hadron collider
large hadron collider huge ring kilometers
thats accelerator accelerate protons
two different directions
collide four points
one colliding points
atlas experiment
atlas
large collaboration people
im one
name pauline gagnon
im canadian
work american institute
indiana university
live france
work switzerland
thats kind sociology
people cern
mixed background
atlas alone people
different countries
countries
participating experiment
since people like
im canadian grew american institute
people different countries working together
common language work broken english
everybody speaks
mistakes accent

people get along
usually get work done
people murmuring
though may wonder
whats purpose

go extent much work
people build detector
work analyze data comes
essentially increase knowledge
matter made
universe live
place
come
going
fundamental question
nothing puts food plate right away
food might come later know
research never know
come
going
lets see find
bit like mushroom hunts know
bring back something really good
make good dish
might come back
anything suitable
saying earlier accelerator
accelerates particles
detectors
detect comes
detector fancy camera
take snapshot happens two protons
come collisions
energy released collision
one small tiny point
allows create particle
e equals mc squared
energy put
transform mass
c squareds exchange rate
energy mass
create new particles
study behave

voiceover saw opening
cern lhc due start soon
decided
could good opportunity
thats jumped
think actually beautiful part
modern cathedrals building
thats way see
like community single aim
single scope
producing machines actually
nobody built like cathedral
machines whirring
im charge magnets cern
everything magnets
machines
arrived cern years working
thermonuclear fusion
think lured adventure
lhc
beginning lhc
fact today hole
maintenance work
construction reconstruction lhc magnets
mostly dipoles
work quadropoles well
main elements make
superconducting cryostat lhc
well magnets main mass
accelerator
youve seen accelerators cern
magnets guide particles
drive around circular path
go back real accelerating
component mumbles
need thousands times
tens thousands times second
like lhc
main function magnet
guide particles back
call dipoles
focus onto
closed orbit machine
quadropole
addition
quadropole also squeeze beam
small size
like smaller hair
experimental region
main function magnets
video ideal powers strength
think lets start electrical power
using
need electrical power
run machines
cern using roughly megawatts
electrical power run accelerators
thats less consumption
small city like geneva
requires indeed lot power
spite fact using superconductors
lhc uses megawatts
whole complex preinjectors
use also megawatts inject beam
lhc
magnetic field
give feeling strong magnetic field
imagine magnetic field
magnets eight tesla
produces forces
magnets meters long
forces produce magnet
order tons per half magnet
tons per meter magnets
every half magnet
lot weight needs taken
strong structures put around
magnets encircled
strong structural steel
keeping together
magnetic field
field nominal eight tesla
compare magnetic field
earth
barely see magnetic needle
earth producing geneva
half gauss
compare magnetic field
lhc
eight tesla
thats factor
producing lhc
magnetic field
compared magnetic field
earth
people murmuring
machine whirring
voiceover meters underground
jura lake geneva
cavern atlas experiment
biggest experiment high energy physics
ever built
cavern huge
meters meters cavern
inside detector
least tons
weight tour eiffel paris
cavern fully occupied fact
detector
one detectors
measured expulsion
year last year
maintenance mode
period stop
open detector
work
aim quite varied
one main aim
one find press
discovery expulsion
apart particle
mechanism
field mechanism gives mass
particles
one aims
detector
general particles detector
measure several aspects nature
several aspects nature
tiny dimensions
back time
accelerator time machine
going energy allows us go
back time reach tiny amount
time big bang
description nature know today
moment would say quite complete
especially discovery expulsions
many things dont understand
detector built
example questions dark matter
well one basic question
difference amount matter
antimatter
knowledge building
knowledge building materials
tells big bang
certain moment time beginning
matter matter
exists universe
comes small point
everything expanded way
give image

find tiny point anonymous amount
energy matter density
must way put together
conceivable way see
symmetric way thinking
must amount
matter antimatter
course ask

antimatter destroying
way tiny difference
matter antimatter
makes exist
certainly mystery
mysteries like amount dark matter
see look
look kind phenomena
also space
look matter space
really compute totally matter
space
compute
see deficit
call dark matter
dark energy
exactly thing
make size universe
way matter distributed possible
certainly mystery
another mystery would like give
explain energy
time correlated
product energy time
give constant
think moment time
aim zero
keep constant
energy infinite
paradox
something maybe approach
best
time zero something difficult
people murmuring
machine whirring
voiceover
research sounds bit strange
mean one hand want make
confirmation test present theory
time
always looking something
asks destroying present theory
go something find something new
yeah direct explanation
higgs particle
laughing
yeah
yes mean higgs mechanism
one
wondering one explain correctly
easily role higgs field
higgs mechanism higgs particle
laughing something
difficult
yeah explain
higgs also special
unique important role
even mean allowing us exist
important particle
never discovered
one year ago
kind mean
frustrating situation
know theory works well
however one key element theory
wasnt confirmed experiment
nobody seen exist
likely
discovered
likely discovered
sense last piece
theory
mean found put jigsaw puzzle

jigsaw puzzle
completion
may mean
glue put wall
may want disassemble instead
physics doesnt go like
analogy last piece jigsaw puzzle
works fine
soon
analogy doesnt uphold anymore
want
first confirm still confirm
particle really last piece
jigsaw puzzle something similar
may totally different
people murmuring
voiceover picture
coarse model mumbles
history universe
nobody tells us truth
within present knowledge
best
indeed explain nicely
able observe
maybe come new observation
remember fundamentally universe
studying lhc
taught matter
matter constitute visible matter
constitute universe
rest unknown
dark matter
something know exists
clue
even something even mysterious dark energy
something gain
respect exists
need explain
given properties evolution universe
clue exists
word today situation
pool knowledge percent
universe
ignore totally rest universe
specific place
atlas experiment
looking recreating primordial matter
matter existed
shortly big bang
talking fraction
microseconds beginning universe
time temperature extremely high
energy density high
matter completely different shape
today
recreate new primordial state matter
try understand
nature properties primordial matter
evolves state
early universe
state know today
imagine single collision two lead nuclei
producing particles
going equipment
particles
look see
identify
course dont take picture
particle
take picture track
particle leaves goes
equipment
less
would go ski slope
dont see skier
see traces skier
traces say
okay skier
went
looking depths trace
idea weight skier
exercise
never see skier
see traces
course full trace skier
need big field
really using brute force
smart
use energy able make
create collision create
new particles
course creation part
need bring small particle
high speed
talking high speed
something close
speed light
need big machinery
machinery well need magnet
make particle turn
need electric field accelerate
one million different elements
make whole thing work
think cern really best example
world humanity
following common objective
dont discover anything science
think achieved
major achievement
speaking foreign language
voiceover speaking
speaking foreign language
voiceover dont know
voiceover basically think
understand
voiceover think really understand
voiceover speaking foreign language
bring technical mumbles
voiceover think list chaperone also
important
voiceover thats suspicion right
someone hit crash button
thats question
turn first place
voiceover mumbling
voiceover yeah received emergency
someone hit crash button
voiceover mean meaning measures
dont know
people murmuring
voiceover law
someone hit crash button
dont think someone
someone hit crash button
people murmuring
voiceover okay question
first thing find
looked reprocess
versus prom data
stay prompt
reprocess data largest changes
jets
find statement little bit surprising
voiceover question
quantitative measure
mumbles differences see
plots also
show
backup
look later
dont want kill stream
voiceover im quite sure
put backup
voiceover assent
think thats ill learn question
okay take offline
go
look frozen
still know alive
think shock much question
mumbling
people laughing
people murmuring
hes gone
okay became invisible
people murmuring
questions till end please
laughing
voiceover anybody outside cern
still hear us
mumbling
oh good good
voiceover hear
voiceover go sit wait
voiceover beginning
heavily involved building system
call trigger system
trigger system actually selects online
real time interesting collisions
recorded
analyzed later
involves development
electronic system operates fast
looks collision million times per second
sort digital camera
takes million pictures per second
analyzes
doesnt take pictures
looks pictures
looks interesting patterns
example interesting patterns
case maybe hundred
times per second
trigger system recognizes
marks photographs like
really recording
dont
like take photographs digital camera
take many snapshots
eliminate like
online extremely fast
first important discovery particle
looks much like socalled higgs particle
also called god particles god particle
term physicists dont really like
anyway discovered new particle
going measure properties
make sure really
long sought higgs particles
indeed something completely new
actually experiment built
another main purpose
main purpose really discover
example new forces physics
know know gravity example
also forces
example electromagnetic forces universe
maybe even forces
know
could discovered experiment
could also example discover
completely new spatial dimensions
may small
able see
tool like large hadron collider
experiment
use really like giant microscope
really look deep nature
hope find something new
example imaginable gravity
becomes strong force
much stronger used
go small distances
example smash two protons
done lhc
really come small distances
possible gravity becomes
strong
gravity becomes strong
could also create miniblack holes
microscopic black holes
would spectacular new signature
unknown physics
constant struggle
course kids sometimes complain
mommy theres nothing eat
shall eat
laughs
well im alone
one get help one
think even family suffers
think end see enthusiastic
see really achieved something
something really satisfying
show new ways
think normally families understand
also say
mind also
lots divorces cern
mainly much work
people enthusiastic know
mean people come nine
leave five
look watch
know really like spend time
put means
bring results
also get personal satisfaction
voiceover center cern
essentially two main important connections
one connection brings us experiments
essentially main flux data
experiments
beams colliding
events collisions
result collisions recorded
filtered across different levels filtering
eventually shipped
via dedicated network
first connection
data routing stored
disc immediately
ready immediately analyzed
first part analysis
actually call general reconstruction
idea
raw data
also technical term
raw data receiving
experiments
reconstruct trajectories example
identify particles
give
lets see assign energies directions
data also shipped outside
shipped initially mean
directly cern
site important computer centers
less compatible one
turn
redistributing data
places typical university
university type facilities
final analysis example
done
activities connected analysis
data
think one visualize data coming
experiments stored
given initial reconstruction
also distributed
lets say
backbone activity
born think
talking lsa people age et cetera
came conclusion
know apollo period
end beginning
really influence us
initially passionate astronomy
astronauts kind
eventually becoming growing older
became interest physics
decided
think specific
know interest correlation astronomy
particular period
space exploration
know one side astronomys gigantic
distances worlds really visit directly
distances
go particle physics
kind mirror image
go smaller smaller
smaller
find worlds
really fascinating strange sometimes
bizarre clearly
one things
clearly moves moved go physics
even im computing
side clearly proudness
say well know
experiments really something
really interesting really cool
giving small contribution
think somebody
physics background
cern even move
keeps fascination
mean home
dream place

think
machine whirring
electricity whirring
voiceover fire brigade
emergency services
actually like city
challenge job
asked beginning

manage small city
give ideas
mean city
roughly guest scientists
coming world
nationalities
roughly staff
postdocs
students apprentices
population needs accommodation
services customer client
would needed small city
actually sense
time organization
like organization
also providing legislation
like convention gives us right
also obligation handle certain things
example fix salaries
like
according rules
approved member states
sense kind state
states
need long breath
sometimes problem
discuss things politicians
theyre used work horizons
three five years
respect return investment
less immediate
immediate means tomorrow
seen
take example world wide web
invented cern
need sometimes would say average
least years years
first basic ideas
first industrial product
machines whirring
people murmuring
voiceover im theoretical physicist
job know come
ideas possible explanation
im trying understand
consequences ideas
test ideas
using experimental result
mumbling result obtain
lhc big machine
built cern
working pretty well moment
mean good ideas come every moment
ready
dangerous
particular driving car right
try keep ideas alert
prepared getting back home
take little piece paper
writing ideas
try finish computation
time stupid
making errors et cetera
time time right
understand exactly something new
thats fantastic course days
coming back home evening
feeling good
youre manageable evenings
morning
feeling understand
something nobody world
thought
thats really exciting research
hours moments
youll know people earth
really clear understanding problem
discovering expulsion like
discovering yet another particle
really really trying
understand fundamental laws
fundamental principle govern universe
long time know
one main team particle physics
theoretical physics high energy physics
gauge principle
gauge principle really theory
explain particle interact
basic exchange gauge possum
maybe discovery x possum
discover new fundamental
principle nature could really govern
universe structured
mean much interested
new particle
really want understand
principle behind new particles
discovery new particle
telling something fundamental
nature fundamental physics
would new space time dimension
new interactions
new fundamental interaction particles
thats really
mean fact know
understand interaction exchange
gauge possum
really big step forward
understanding nature
still things dont
quite understand
mean instance fact electromagnetism
described one particular symmetry nature
weak interaction
described another symmetry
strong interaction
yet another symmetry
particles symmetry
something deeper
behind symmetries
bigger symmetry instance
unify symmetries
associated different interactions
yeah trying understand
kind things
good ideas
still dont know ideas
true
machine whirring
people murmuring
people murmuring
voiceover mean im physicist
used explain im
develop toys physicists
im involved machine side
several people cern
deciding done
physics
charge
develop tools
order allow people make research
really hierarchy cern
least feeling
people physics side
deciding less done
provide
required tools able investigate
looking
real hierarchy
several
different specialties cern
technical parts
section called mdt
actual section leader
used translate making dreams true
people asking dedicated tools
try develop tools
presently working new generation
superconducting magnets
using new technology mumbling
superconducting cables
order reach higher field
required upgrade
luminosity lhc
magnets presently installed lhc
based mumbles titanium technology
reach limit
magnetic field reached
kind superconductors
trying develop new mumbles
dipole millimeters bore
tesla
give rough idea
represent
required mumbles cable
produce one coil around
swiss francs per coil
need four coils size
need seconds
destroy cables
quite difficult deal
machines whirring
people murmuring
machines whirring
people murmuring
voiceover working superconductivity
magnets test
cooled
low temperature
case kelvin
even lower temperature
kelvin
need kind thermos
need
vessel wellinsulated
outside warm
respect magnet
basically kelvin difference
would say
degree relative number
make possible
heat leak really minimum
build equipments essentially made
vessel put magnet
obviously
close access liquid
case liquid helium
cool k
equipment
connect powering
obviously power generation
surface nominal
degrees celsius temperature hole
bring current magnet
vessel
vessel also helps us
make interface magnet
outside
obviously information
coming form wires
plugging cards
data acquisition
behind controlled room
front us computers
get information visible
graphical way way
analyze later
essentially behind
basically behind
three test station type
three units nearly independent
one others
well familys completely
say husband working cern
husband working area
im
hes also magnets
okay life like
three years old child
shes going school kindergarten cern
morning coming family cern
dispatched three sides
husband working mumbles side
french area
working swiss part
french parts still french territory
daughter swiss side
kindergarten laughs
yeah husband also another son
way
hes control room
family also
brotherinlaw working atlas detector
end family laughing
yeah
well saying leave
maybe space imagination
assuming
enough understand world
universe works
im sure
think territory
difficult
somehow close understand complete stuff
becomes hard improve
convinced
steps big
big enough get rid space
remains
think top
going slowly high high
think still far away
im sure come next year
higgs explain higgs dreams
gone
think going ahead
find new elements may bring
idea course
probably bring us closer closer
im convinced understand
complete picture laughs
machine whirring
voiceover might know principle
called tropic principle
whole nature laws nature
designed make possible
man exist
doubt
course also realize science
physics one perspective
understanding reality nature
long discussion pope
visited cern
present pope previous pope
john paul second
third
discussed
conflict science physics
religion
agreed conflict
agreed
ask well agree
dont repelitate helium
plate eating plate
looking top
would say thats circle
look side
say thats circle
thats line
two conflicting perspectives
might ask forever line
circle
thats science reality
looking reality different projections
see one projection
religious another projection
might fight right
end two different projections
reality
takes long time clarify subconcept
define something
real image data sync true science
create concepts necessary
find laws nature
maybe concepts unique
might different way
describe nature
different concepts
