    russ   yeah

  you know  i don t see
a captain out here  
on your left 
pass it 
make him make
the first move  conway 
  hey  averman  you got nothing  
    dwayne   over here  charlie 
come on  charlie  clear it out  
clear it out  
freeze  
i said freeze  
  averman 
  i did freeze 
where s the one place you
never want to clear the puck  
  it looked open 
 just answer the question  conway 
listen  i m not a defenseman 
i m a scorer  
  panting  
follow me 
anybody share his opinion  
all right then 
take a knee 
what s the one thing all
great teams have in common  
  great coaching 
  don t try to suck up to me  averman 
defense 
see  unlike scoring 
defense never quits 
but to play great defense 
you need one thing above all else 
bet it starts
with a   w   
confidence 
listen  if you learn nothing
else when you re here  you learn this 
all right    cause
it s not just about hockey 
it s easy to be confident
when you have control of the puck 
it s very  very difficult
to keep that confidence   
when you gotta take whatever
strange bounces life throws your way 
don t be careless 
but don t be too careful either 
you cannot be afraid
to lose 
that s how you gain the confidence
to attack the game   
when the puck
isn t yours 
that s how you attack life 
even when you think
you don t have any control 
and that s how
you play real defense 
is this seat taken  
  laughs  
you know  you are just like
the rest of those snobs 
i am not a snob 
oh  really   well  you don t like me
because i m an athlete 
that s a snob 
you don t even know me 
if i knew you 
i wouldn t like you 
oh  yeah

of fresh air around here 
the board is going to approve
the withdrawal of your scholarships

but after that 
it will be necessary for you   
to enjoy other
educational opportunities

let s face it 
the ducks are drowning 
i got my team 
either they stay or i go 
we ll miss you  ted 
  why us  
   cause he s a slime 
  i know where that dude lives 
we re just pawns 
puppets for the stage show 
jesters to entertain the king 
barnacles on the bottom of  
  shut up  
  coach  is this legal  
i mean  don t we have
contracts or something  
i don t know
what it is 
all i know is
we re gonna fight it 
  buckley clears throat  
do i have a motion for reconsideration  
  board members murmuring qyietly  
i m sorry  coach  but unless there is
a motion from a board member   
and a second 
the decision must stand 
told you not to worry 
you leave us no choice
but to bring in our attorney 
    varsity player   please 
    door opens  
  board members murmuring  
dean buckley 
members of the board 
as counsel
for coach orion   
and the freshman hockey team 
i m here today to set forth
your legal options 
so that you may make the best possible
decision for all parties concerned 
mr  bombay  this isn t
a legal proceeding 
not yet  but i can assure you
that it will be 
do you mind  
these scholarships  
an offer  
became a binding contract upon
the signatures of the recipients   
and acceptance
by the ducks 
they cannot be voided except for cause
which  i guarantee you  you have none 
should you decide to pursue
their cancellation 
i will slap you
with an injunction 
i will tie this matter up
in court for years 
until long after these kids
have gone on to college 
and i will collect damages 
i will win 
because i am very  very good 
you know why i m so good 
because i had a good education 
you gave it to me 
and you re gonna give it
to these kids 
he is good 
just gettin  started 
now some of you may be snobbish enough
to believe that   
these ducks don t belong
at eden hall 
let me tell you 
you are dead wrong 
these are remarkable
young people 
you give them
their full shot 
and i promise you
they will succeed 
not only on the ice 
but in the classrooms as well 
these people are my friends 
and i know what they can do 
accordingly  i demand that you
reinstate their scholarships 
for their benefit
and for your own 
  whispers  
this is ridiculous  really 
what s going on  man  
  sighs  
i move that the scholarships   
be reinstated
