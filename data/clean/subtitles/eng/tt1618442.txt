stewardess on pa  ladies and gentlemen 
the captain has turned on   
be glad you didn t get them wet 
 passengers shouting indistinctly 
kaulder  i ve been looking
for these for a while 
these are ancient runes 
they can manipulate weather 
rain  wind  cold  heat   
and you just jammed them
together in your bag 
you know what you get
when you mix a thunderstorm
with cool  moist air at 40 000 feet 
 thunder rumbling 
it s simple science 
 passengers screaming 
kaulder  unbelievable 
you witches have no idea
the power you ve got 
 passengers clamoring 
 crackling 
woman   sobbing  oh  my god

enjoy new york 
sir   fasten seatbelts  signs are on 
i need you to take a seat 
my name is kaulder 
i need you to get back
to your seat  kaulder 
i d love to hear about

how d you know

i ve met a lot of people in my life 
you d be amazed what you pick up 
 sirens blaring in distance 
dolan the 36th  witches live
among us in secret 
their magic passed down
from an ancient race 
diluted  half forgotten 
but dangerously powerful 
after centuries of conflict 
a truce was forged 
witches would be allowed to live
and govern themselves if they followed
one strict rule  that magic
never be used against humans 
but a truce is a fragile thing 
there are some who long for
the return of the old ways 
the dark days of the witch queen 
it is those whom kaulder deals with 
for 800 years  he has served
the axe and cross 
together we have kept watch
and kept the peace 
 phone dialing 
 line ringing 
uh  i m sorry  father dolan 
he s in a meeting 
oh 
 elevator bell dinging 
the meeting has concluded 
dolan the 36th  i serve the axe
and cross in a very different manner 
i am the 36th dolan 
and i write kaulder s history 
i am his handler  his confessor 
and  i like to think  his friend 
you have no sense of time 
course i do 
it s just different than yours 
dolan the 36th  i assume
your mission was a success 
you recovered the weather
runes without incident 
what happened to the ipad i gave you 
i re gifted it 
we re not all as adaptable as you 
you know paper s the past 
it s also a useful object
on which to record it 
 classical music playing over speakers 
are you reminiscing
about the ludwig affair 
i m in a sentimental mood 
ah 
about my retirement 
that s why you ve come back 
we have had a good run 
we took out some nasty covens 
you re really ready to call it quits 
it s only been 50 years 
i m finally getting used to you 
oh  is that all it took 
 chuckles 
i ll miss you  kid 
this is a waterman 402 
i had your initials engraved on it 
dolan the 36th  it s very rare 
probably lowered the value quite a bit 
not to me 
you reconsider 
you can still keep the pen 
dolan the 36th 
i think you ll like my successor 
i m leaving you in more modern hands 
what about the vow you took 
i vowed to face death at your side 
not to work until i keel over 
thirty five dolans have come before you 
here s to the only one
whose advice i ever listened to 
only to ignore it 
but i always listen 
what if you were retiring  too 
 chuckles 
i mean  what would you do
if your next mission was your last 
but it won t be 
humor me 
i have no complaints 
every day i wake up 
the world sleeps a little easier 
kaulder  you have tasted more
of life than i can ever imagine 
but it s been a long time
since you really lived 
you re missing out on the best part
of our brief stay in this world 
the part where you share it 
find someone to trust 
i trust you 
 chuckles 
perhaps someone a little more comely 
 both laughing 
i know  i haven t lived
as long and rich a life as you 
but i do know that there is more to it
than a parade of stewardesses
marching to the dulcet tones
of moonlight sonata 
now what in the world do you know
about stewardesses anyway 
i wasn t born a priest 
 kaulder laughing 
let s do some work 
i know you think it s dull 
but let s start at the beginning 
it goes without saying 
but you ve served with great distinction 
if i may  when i meet kaulder tomorrow 
i should play it cool  right 
no coffee until after the ritual 
don t worry about your style 
he ll take the piss out of you anyway 
but you ll be fine 
it s  uh  kaulder that i worry about 
dolan the 37th  you worry about kaulder 
do you know how the elders
of the axe and cross refer to him 
they call him  the weapon  
when i put in my reports 
all they want to know is numbers 
how many witches
i ve turned over for detention 
how many slain for breaking the law 
can you blame them 
what he does is so important 
yes  that s true 
but he isn t just a weapon 
and those of us who know
the truth  we bear responsibility 
whatever happens  promise me
you ll watch out for him 
of course  that s my job 
 thunder rumbling 
dolan the 37th  taxi 
 all ticking 
 cell phone ringing 
hello 
dolan the 37th   over phone  kaulder 
dolan the 36th passed away
peacefully last night 
the ceremony will be tomorrow 
i m sorry for your loss 
man  thirty six have taken
the name  dolan  before you 
are you worthy of becoming the 37th 
i testify that i am 
man  do you promise to serve
our brother kaulder in all things 
to know him only as he knows himself 
i promise 
 dolan the 37th grunts 
so you re the new guy 
we ve actually met before 
a long time ago 
you see that cornerstone 
i watched them lay it in when this
was nothing more than a cornfield 
that was a long time ago 
i pledge my life and loyalty
to you as the 37th dolan 
i swear to help you carry out
your duty to the order   
when they were building this city 
construction crews discovered
a mass gravesite  60 feet below ground 
filled with thousands of forgotten slaves 
know what they did 
 stammers  no 
worked by night  filled the hole 
and kept building 
there are shades of evil everywhere 
dolan the 37th 
so  i m sorting you out with
fresh credit cards  new passport 
and a new identity 
just gettin  used to the old one 
well  it s out of date 
there are global databases now  cctv s 
smartphones and geotracking 
the world is changing 
only on the surface 
right  but it s important
to keep a low profile 
  kaulder  mmm hmm 
   car alarm chirps 
dolan the 37th  uh   
i guess we should be thankful
it s not red 
may i ask where we re going 
i ve seen people get old  retire  and die 
rarely on the same day 
he was found at his desk 
what are we looking for 
how do you know when there s
magic in the vicinity 
a witch s magic comes from four elements 
fire  water  earth and air 
applying the correct alchemical triggers
will reveal its presence 
 exhaling 
no magic here 
just wanted to be sure 
if the window hasn t been opened 
how did that get in here 
one means nothing 
two  a coincidence 
three  trouble 
 gasps 
 glass shattering 
 creaking 
get down 
dolan the 37th  what 
he was killed by witches 
never in the history of the axe and cross
has a dolan ever been murdered 
you wanna quit 
no 
i want a raise 
this is a declaration of war 
who could have done this 
a concealment spell was placed
to make everything look normal 
they were searching for something 
didn t want us to know 
elemental magic is neutral 
at its root it s neither good nor evil 
but this is different 
this is dark magic 
beyond evil 
they tied him to the chair 
 death  
is that part of the spell 
you were here last night
before he died  right 
yes 
let me see your hands 
now 
i was five years old
when witches set our house on fire 
my parents died 
but you walked through the flames 
wrapped me in a blanket 
and jumped out the second story window 
your body broke the fall 
i told you we d met before 
if you don t remember  i can
refer you to the entry   
no  i remember 
you hunted down the witches
and brought them to justice 
i ve waited my entire life for
the opportunity to help you 
well  now s your chance 
you can help me hunt
the witches that did this 
shouldn t i have a gun or
an iron mallet or something 
take a deep breath  center yourself 
dolan the 37th  right  of course 
because resisting enchantment
requires a clear mind 
now  max is a 14th level warlock 
there s nothing you can do 
may as well relax 
girl  free sample  father 
oh  thank you 
kaulder  i d think twice about that 
 bugs squirming 
man  i don t know that i can do  10 000 
max  you know the level of enchantment
they are getting from that 
business is good  right 
yeah 
oh  crap 
shop s closed  max 
kaulder  it has been too long 
it is not illegal to sell
mind altering bugs 
when they re used on humans  it is 
they re mixing them in the cupcakes 
i hadn t noticed 
notice this 
griffin s henbane 
very rare and forbidden 
this is used in necromancy  dark magic 
you know i do not deal
in these kinds of bad things 
max  you re too smart
to go down that road 
one can only imagine how many
times i ve been lied to 
more than anyone in history  actually 
come on  kaulder 
you must understand 
anyone who would use this herb
is not afraid of you  and that scares me 
kaulder  more than i scare you 
max 
the man who came to see me
has an odor on his skin 
a whiff of garlic that was not garlic 
arsenic  anything else 
and moldering crabapples 
thank you  max 
  be careful 
  kaulder  not in the habit 
not you  him 
so  all that made sense to you 
it didn t to you 
no 
arsenic was used for embalming
back in the civil war 
whoever killed dolan is likely living
in what was once a funeral parlor 
we just have to find one
with a crabapple tree 
what s that for 
a cab 
you re not qualified
for what happens next 
oh 
right  i ll get a receipt 
 gasps 
whoa 
 birds chirping 
didn t your mother ever teach you
not to eat candy from trees 
 kaulder speaking indistinctly 
go home  kid 
 faint clattering 
 girl whimpering 
go away 
it s okay 
  get away from me 
  shh 
it s okay 
get away from me now 
  i m not gonna hurt you 
  go away 
it s okay 
 both grunting 
ah   
oh  shit 
 screaming 
 moans 
kaulder  you killed dolan  why 
who the bloody hell s dolan  huh 
i never met the man in my life 
 ellic laughs 
do you like my new pen  huh 
when i imagined my first prosecution
in front of the council 
i never thought it would be
for a crime against one of our own 
   hisses 
  ellic lemasniel 
hello  father  whoo 
you look like a good man 
tasty little thing  you  i never went   
please don t think less of me 
 ellic grunts 
i ll confess it later 
the witch council receives you 
37th dolan of the axe and cross 
all  the peace endures 
the peace endures 
i present the accused 
ellic lemasniel  for judgment 
for the murder of dolan the 36th 
i present the evidence found
in the accused s dwelling 
found  oh  come on 
what  you look like
a terrible band from the  80s 
 laughs 
look at your hair 
he will be judged 
ellic  blah  blah  blah 
you know my great grandfather s
grandfather served the queen  huh 
the queen 
you re a bureaucracy o  cowards
and i don t recognize the authority
here in this council 
nor do i abide by your law   spits 
the laws serve to control
and contain magic 
it is only by the operations of this
council that another war does not begin 
i won t lie  i m proud of what i done 
i murdered your priest 
i drip dried him like he was a stuck pig 
kaulder  our priest  and my friend 
kaulder 
oh  shit  this guy again 
so we re to judge him
without interrogation 
has anyone asked him
who he was workin  with 
there s no three of pentacles card 
that means he worked alone 
kaulder  the cards are wrong 
he cast a shape shifting spell 
i haven t seen that crafted in 800 years 
not since the time of the witch queen 
glaeser  ha  the witch queen is long dead 
that her magic could return is impossible 
  is it impossible 
  glaeser  it is 
  you have the authority   
  glaeser  enough 
dolan the 37th     to turn
this city inside out 
for the crimes of illegal crafting   
  find who he s working with 
     and human sacrifice   
  and i m proud o  what i done 
     we sentence   
     ellic lemasniel   
  i m proud o  what i done 
     to incarceration   
  ellic  i took a stand 
glaeser     in the bedrock
beneath this chamber 
ellic  you are sad reflections of   
glaeser  arise  sentinel 
and carry the condemned to prison 
 roaring 
you ll never see daylight again 
 screaming 
no  no  you may hold me now 
but you ll never have us all 
 bug squeaking faintly 
glaeser  what is that 
kaulder  hey  kid 
what are you doing 
hello  father 
  still with us  old friend 
  dolan the 37th  he s alive 
barely 
he s been cursed 
how 
  musca mali 
  plague fly 
13th century black magic 
they were created in the tree
of the queen  correct 
that s right 
why didn t they just murder him 
they wanted to interrogate him 
when a plague fly burrows inside
of you  it breaks your will 
whatever the killers wanted to know 
he would have told them 
 buzzing 
but the question remains 
what did they want to know 
he isn t getting up 
not unless we could break the curse 
and the only way to do that
is to kill the witch who cast it 
the one ellic works for 
dolan s got two days  tops 
hang in there  for me 
 death  
it s a message from dolan  not the killer 
 remember your death  
what does it mean 
there s only one way
to remember my death

every generation has to be given
their chance to destroy the world

   chanting 
 max screaming 
enjoy the shadows 
 creatures screeching 
this is the history of witches 
your history 
chloe  that s you 
kaulder  yeah 
least they got your eyes right 
these are the dream walkers 
the witch queen s deadliest assassins 
somehow they used to jump into your mind
and pry out your most precious memories 
and then they d twist  em
into your worst nightmares 
what  you re giving a history lesson here
or you re just trying to scare me 
there s something no one knows
about dream walkers 
they don t need memory potions 
that power lies within them 
i have something buried deep
in my mind that i must remember 
and you re the only one that can help me 
no  i can t 
chloe   
no  i can t 
you know  i have
a younger brother  and  uh 
he had this knack for just pissing me off 
and one day he pushed it too far 
and i somehow entered his mind 
i hurt him  i didn t mean to 
but i hurt him badly 
so i ran away 
what were their names 
your wife and daughter 
helena 
elizabeth 
i haven t said their names
out loud in a long time 
kaulder  even if i wanted to help you 
i wouldn t know where to begin 
think of a word
that you associate with me 
could be anything 
empty everything else out of your head 
and just focus on that one word 
one word 
if you tell me the word 
i ll focus on it  too 
sometimes that helps 
what s the word 
alone 
 elizabeth laughing 
chloe  take my hand 
grosette  this way  men

man  so ends the queen 
  in the name of the father   
   medieval kaulder gasping

medieval dolan  kaulder is alive 
our nightmare ends with a miracle 
help him

 ticking 
it s her heart

soldier  end it  brother dolan 
 kaulder screaming 
grosette  destroy her  dolan 
no 
 indistinct chatter 
you kept it 
it s over  the witch queen is dead 
they betrayed you from the start 
that s why they tortured your friend 
because he knew where the heart was 
they re gonna bring back the queen 
belial  for eight hundred years 
we ve waited for her return 
you should be honored  traitor 
you will be sacrificed for our cause 
kaulder  i know where belial
brought all that dirt 
the truck he rented
had a standard gps locator   
you lied to me 
you saved her heart 
 remember your death  
it s not what you think 
you knew what it meant all
along  and you said nothing 
because i wasn t going to be responsible
for the dissolution of the axe
and cross on my very first   
they re bringing back the queen 
you don t know what you ve done 
i swore an oath to keep it secret 
this lie has kept apocalypse
at bay for hundreds of years 
we were afraid if the queen s
heart was destroyed 
you d lose your immortality  or die 
that wasn t your choice to make 
that s what the old man thought 
the night he was attacked 
i think he was going to destroy it 
for you 
to set you free 
at least the axe and cross
still has their weapon 
belial  you will serve the queen   
max  no  please 
   like it or not 
 belial chanting 
 wood creaking 
ah 
go to my apartment  you ll be safe there 
no  the deal was that we stick together 
i m going alone  if i can t trust my own
people  how the hell can i trust you 
this isn t who you are

kaulder  pierce her with iron 
scour her by fire 
bring her endless death 
 man coughing 
i ve missed you  kaulder 
here s what you don t understand 
what your kind never understood 
i ve shown mercy 
i could have killed every last one of you 
i ve done the math 
i ve had the time 
you re different now  so confident 
maybe you shouldn t have made me immortal 
kaulder  i came to help 
chloe  i told you not to   
 kaulder grunts 
 choking 
 grunts 
 kaulder straining 
 screaming 
immortality was never yours  it was mine 
  you just carried it for me 
   screaming 
until now 
i am reborn 
ah 
 screeching 
your race
has always been frightened 
 groans 
hiding in caves 
huddling around fire 
finally 
 loud buzzing 
 chanting 
 thunder rumbling 
hey  kid  i was afraid i was too late 
i hope i don t look as rough as you do 
okay 
 groans 
i killed the one who cursed you 
   coughs 
  here 
drink this 
thank you 
the witch queen has returned 
i thought my immortality
was the way that she punished me 
but she just used me
to save it for herself 
i m afraid i bear some responsibility 
it was hubris to think that our secret
wouldn t be discovered by the enemy 
i ve seen what comes next 
death 
the witch queen will cast
another plague curse 
haven t covens with that kind
of power been destroyed 
we don t destroy witches anymore 
we incarcerate them 
we took all the most powerful witches
that ever walked the earth
and put  em in one place 
the witch prison 
and they ve been waiting 
waiting to be released 
waiting to exact revenge 
we created the perfect coven 
now i m right back where i started 
you defeated her once 
you can defeat her again 
kaulder 
you must go 
you have to fight 
 mechanical whirring 
chloe  kaulder 
i never had a name for it 
but my enemies
came to call it  hexenbane  
witch slayer 
i m coming  too 
our agreement depended
on me keeping you safe 
no  our agreement was that
if i helped you  you d keep me safe 
if i get hurt now  i stay hurt 
where would that leave you 
you know  i don t care 
who says that a witch can t hunt witches 
dolan the 37th  chloe 
kaulder 
 wood creaking 
chloe  what is this 
kaulder  it s a plague tree  she s here 
when the spell is done 
the fly swarm will be released 
we haven t much time 
stay close 
chloe  kaulder  where are the prisoners 
my god 
every witch i ever caught 
the queen s using their power
to release the plague 
how 
the chant 
no witch would be strong enough
to cast this spell alone 
but the witch queen s
linking their minds like a chain 
so how do we stop them 
every chain has a weak link 
 kaulder grunting 
 witches chanting indistinctly 
 chanting 
  i ll do the honors 
  no 
it s not his body we need to destroy 
it s his mind 
but if he dies in his dreams 
the plague will be stopped 
i wish there was another way 
you ll still be here
when i get back  right 
you re taking on the queen
alone  aren t you 
it has to end 
hey 
be careful in there 
so are you worried about me then 
well  i ve gotten used to you 
good hunting

 witches chanting loudly 
 distant roar 
the sentinel 
and it won t stop until this prisoner
is put back in his cell 
 distant rumbling 
it s coming for ellic 
 cocking gun 
 roaring 
 kaulder yelling 
 groans 
dolan the 37th  kaulder 
 groans 
 roaring 
 screeches 
 grunting 
 gunshots 
if there s any sign she s getting hurt
in there  you have to wake her up 
and promise me you ll get her
as far away from here as you can 
dolan the 37th  of course 
 ellic chanting 
 chanting 
 screams 
 chanting grows louder 
 gasps 
 chanting stops 
the chanting stopped 
she did it 
witch queen  a dream walker
shows your past 
only i can show the future 
you will fail  and humanity will fall 
i ve taken this world back 
not yet 
witch queen  can you feel it 
your mortality 
your life ebbing away 
 witch queen laughs 
 kaulder grunts 
 witch queen laughing 
elizabeth  father

dream walker 
 chanting 
 witches chanting together 
 glass shattering 
 sirens wailing in distance 
dolan the 36th  look at you 
you ugly bitch of a morning 
 witches continue chanting 
you turned against those
you were charged with protecting 
yes  my queen 
make me whole  help me reach my destiny 
grant me the gift of magic 
clay cannot be turned to gold 
without magic  you re just a human 
 flies buzzing 
 groaning 
elizabeth  father 
helena  my love 
you must get up 
elizabeth  father  you need to get up 
save them 
helena  go  my love  fight 
 chloe chanting indistinctly 
 chanting 
you cling to your pathetic life 
and for what reason 
those closest to you betray you 
and those you claim to protect
don t even know your name 
 witch queen laughing 
kaulder  by iron
and fire 
 witch queen screaming 
 electricity crackling 
 sighs 
 fly buzzing 
try doing that with an ipad 
 gasping 
kaulder 
kaulder 
 sobbing 
kaulder 
 gasping 
kaulder  as long as the hexen heart beats 
she s never truly dead 
no  you can t  you ll die 
i m ready to face that reality 
no  there must be another way 
listen to me 
when i was pulled into the shadows 
i saw that there were things
much worse than her 
in the darkness  waiting 
waiting for what 
the world without you 
we still need you 
i need you 
the axe and cross betrayed me 
i can t trust anyone 
you can trust me 
800 years i ve been on this road 
always hunting 
  always   
  alone 
you wouldn t be 
besides 
you still owe me fifty thousand dollars 
 chuckles 
five thousand 
oh  so we re negotiating  then 
 church bells tolling 
the axe and cross would be bothered that
they re no longer in possession
of the queen s heart 
i don t serve the axe and cross anymore 
this time i do it for me 
well  it s about time 
you know  i used to think
the universe ran in endless circles 
always repeating itself 
always predictable 
and now 
i don t know what happens next 
do you know what we mortals call that 
living 
you know 
i still need you 
well  then
i m at your service 
come on  you re not getting any younger 
so you ready to go  or what 
i m driving 
  okay
