passengers gasp
stewardess on pa ladies and gentlemen
the captain has turned on
be glad you didnt get them wet
passengers shouting indistinctly
kaulder ive been looking
for these for a while
these are ancient runes
they can manipulate weather
rain wind cold heat
and you just jammed them
together in your bag
you know what you get
when you mix a thunderstorm
with cool moist air at 40000 feet
thunder rumbling
its simple science
passengers screaming
kaulder unbelievable
you witches have no idea
the power youve got
passengers clamoring
crackling
woman sobbing oh my god
bronwyn are you gonna turn me
over to the witch council
no
bronwyn youre gonna kill me

im tryin to stop you
from killing yourself
enjoy new york
sir fasten seatbelts signs are on
i need you to take a seat
my name is kaulder
i need you to get back
to your seat kaulder
id love to hear about
growing up in sefrou
howd you know
havent had an accent in years
ive met a lot of people in my life
youd be amazed what you pick up
sirens blaring in distance
dolan the 36th witches live
among us in secret
their magic passed down
from an ancient race
diluted halfforgotten
but dangerously powerful
after centuries of conflict
a truce was forged
witches would be allowed to live
and govern themselves if they followed
one strict rule that magic
never be used against humans
but a truce is a fragile thing
there are some who long for
the return of the old ways
the dark days of the witch queen
it is those whom kaulder deals with
for 800 years he has served
the axe and cross
together we have kept watch
and kept the peace
phone dialing
line ringing
uh im sorry father dolan
hes in a meeting
oh
elevator bell dinging
the meeting has concluded
dolan the 36th i serve the axe
and cross in a very different manner
i am the 36th dolan
and i write kaulders history
i am his handler his confessor
and i like to think his friend
you have no sense of time
course i do
its just different than yours
dolan the 36th i assume
your mission was a success
you recovered the weather
runes without incident
what happened to the ipad i gave you
i regifted it
were not all as adaptable as you
you know papers the past
its also a useful object
on which to record it
classical music playing over speakers
are you reminiscing
about the ludwig affair
im in a sentimental mood
ah
about my retirement
thats why youve come back
we have had a good run
we took out some nasty covens
youre really ready to call it quits
its only been 50 years
im finally getting used to you
oh is that all it took
chuckles
ill miss you kid
this is a waterman 402
i had your initials engraved on it
dolan the 36th its very rare
probably lowered the value quite a bit
not to me
you reconsider
you can still keep the pen
dolan the 36th
i think youll like my successor
im leaving you in more modern hands
what about the vow you took
i vowed to face death at your side
not to work until i keel over
thirtyfive dolans have come before you
heres to the only one
whose advice i ever listened to
only to ignore it
but i always listen
what if you were retiring too
chuckles
i mean what would you do
if your next mission was your last
but it wont be
humor me
i have no complaints
every day i wake up
the world sleeps a little easier
kaulder you have tasted more
of life than i can ever imagine
but its been a long time
since you really lived
youre missing out on the best part
of our brief stay in this world
the part where you share it
find someone to trust
i trust you
chuckles
perhaps someone a little more comely
both laughing
i know i havent lived
as long and rich a life as you
but i do know that there is more to it
than a parade of stewardesses
marching to the dulcet tones
of moonlight sonata
now what in the world do you know
about stewardesses anyway
i wasnt born a priest
kaulder laughing
lets do some work
i know you think its dull
but lets start at the beginning
it goes without saying
but youve served with great distinction
if i may when i meet kaulder tomorrow
i should play it cool right
no coffee until after the ritual
dont worry about your style
hell take the piss out of you anyway
but youll be fine
its uh kaulder that i worry about
dolan the 37th you worry about kaulder
do you know how the elders
of the axe and cross refer to him
they call him the weapon
when i put in my reports
all they want to know is numbers
how many witches
ive turned over for detention
how many slain for breaking the law
can you blame them
what he does is so important
yes thats true
but he isnt just a weapon
and those of us who know
the truth we bear responsibility
whatever happens promise me
youll watch out for him
of course thats my job
thunder rumbling
dolan the 37th taxi
all ticking
cell phone ringing
hello
dolan the 37th over phone kaulder
dolan the 36th passed away
peacefully last night
the ceremony will be tomorrow
im sorry for your loss
man thirtysix have taken
the name dolan before you
are you worthy of becoming the 37th
i testify that i am
man do you promise to serve
our brother kaulder in all things
to know him only as he knows himself
i promise
dolan the 37th grunts
so youre the new guy
weve actually met before
a long time ago
you see that cornerstone
i watched them lay it in when this
was nothing more than a cornfield
that was a long time ago
i pledge my life and loyalty
to you as the 37th dolan
i swear to help you carry out
your duty to the order
when they were building this city
construction crews discovered
a mass gravesite 60 feet below ground
filled with thousands of forgotten slaves
know what they did
stammers no
worked by night filled the hole
and kept building
there are shades of evil everywhere
dolan the 37th
so im sorting you out with
fresh credit cards new passport
and a new identity
just gettin used to the old one
well its out of date
there are global databases now cctvs
smartphones and geotracking
the world is changing
only on the surface
right but its important
to keep a low profile
kaulder mmmhmm
car alarm chirps
dolan the 37th uh
i guess we should be thankful
its not red
may i ask where were going
ive seen people get old retire and die
rarely on the same day
he was found at his desk
what are we looking for
how do you know when theres
magic in the vicinity
a witchs magic comes from four elements
fire water earth and air
applying the correct alchemical triggers
will reveal its presence
exhaling
no magic here
just wanted to be sure
if the window hasnt been opened
how did that get in here
one means nothing
two a coincidence
three trouble
gasps
glass shattering
creaking
get down
dolan the 37th what
he was killed by witches
never in the history of the axe and cross
has a dolan ever been murdered
you wanna quit
no
i want a raise
this is a declaration of war
who could have done this
a concealment spell was placed
to make everything look normal
they were searching for something
didnt want us to know
elemental magic is neutral
at its root its neither good nor evil
but this is different
this is dark magic
beyond evil
they tied him to the chair
death
is that part of the spell
you were here last night
before he died right
yes
let me see your hands
now
i was five years old
when witches set our house on fire
my parents died
but you walked through the flames
wrapped me in a blanket
and jumped out the second story window
your body broke the fall
i told you wed met before
if you dont remember i can
refer you to the entry
no i remember
you hunted down the witches
and brought them to justice
ive waited my entire life for
the opportunity to help you
well nows your chance
you can help me hunt
the witches that did this
shouldnt i have a gun or
an iron mallet or something
take a deep breath center yourself
dolan the 37th right of course
because resisting enchantment
requires a clear mind
now max is a 14th level warlock
theres nothing you can do
may as well relax
girl free sample father
oh thank you
kaulder id think twice about that
bugs squirming
man i dont know that i can do 10000
max you know the level of enchantment
they are getting from that
business is good right
yeah
oh crap
shops closed max
kaulder it has been too long
it is not illegal to sell
mindaltering bugs
when theyre used on humans it is
theyre mixing them in the cupcakes
i hadnt noticed
notice this
griffins henbane
very rare and forbidden
this is used in necromancy dark magic
you know i do not deal
in these kinds of bad things
max youre too smart
to go down that road
one can only imagine how many
times ive been lied to
more than anyone in history actually
come on kaulder
you must understand
anyone who would use this herb
is not afraid of you and that scares me
kaulder more than i scare you
max
the man who came to see me
has an odor on his skin
a whiff of garlic that was not garlic
arsenic anything else
and moldering crabapples
thank you max
be careful
kaulder not in the habit
not you him
so all that made sense to you
it didnt to you
no
arsenic was used for embalming
back in the civil war
whoever killed dolan is likely living
in what was once a funeral parlor
we just have to find one
with a crabapple tree
whats that for
a cab
youre not qualified
for what happens next
oh
right ill get a receipt
gasps
whoa
birds chirping
didnt your mother ever teach you
not to eat candy from trees
kaulder speaking indistinctly
go home kid
faint clattering
girl whimpering
go away
its okay
get away from me
shh
its okay
get away from me now
im not gonna hurt you
go away
its okay
both grunting
ah
oh shit
screaming
moans
kaulder you killed dolan why
who the bloody hells dolan huh
i never met the man in my life
ellic laughs
do you like my new pen huh
when i imagined my first prosecution
in front of the council
i never thought it would be
for a crime against one of our own
hisses
ellic lemasniel
hello father whoo
you look like a good man
tasty little thing you i never went
please dont think less of me
ellic grunts
ill confess it later
the witch council receives you
37th dolan of the axe and cross
all the peace endures
the peace endures
i present the accused
ellic lemasniel for judgment
for the murder of dolan the 36th
i present the evidence found
in the accuseds dwelling
found oh come on
what you look like
a terrible band from the 80s
laughs
look at your hair
he will be judged
ellic blah blah blah
you know my greatgrandfathers
grandfather served the queen huh
the queen
youre a bureaucracy o cowards
and i dont recognize the authority
here in this council
nor do i abide by your law spits
the laws serve to control
and contain magic
it is only by the operations of this
council that another war does not begin
i wont lie im proud of what i done
i murdered your priest
i dripdried him like he was a stuck pig
kaulder our priest and my friend
kaulder
oh shit this guy again
so were to judge him
without interrogation
has anyone asked him
who he was workin with
theres no three of pentacles card
that means he worked alone
kaulder the cards are wrong
he cast a shapeshifting spell
i havent seen that crafted in 800 years
not since the time of the witch queen
glaeser ha the witch queen is long dead
that her magic could return is impossible
is it impossible
glaeser it is
you have the authority
glaeser enough
dolan the 37th to turn
this city inside out
for the crimes of illegal crafting
find who hes working with
and human sacrifice
and im proud o what i done
we sentence
ellic lemasniel
im proud o what i done
to incarceration
ellic i took a stand
glaeser in the bedrock
beneath this chamber
ellic you are sad reflections of
glaeser arise sentinel
and carry the condemned to prison
roaring
youll never see daylight again
screaming
no no you may hold me now
but youll never have us all
bug squeaking faintly
glaeser what is that
kaulder hey kid
what are you doing
hello father
still with us old friend
dolan the 37th hes alive
barely
hes been cursed
how
musca mali
plague fly
13thcentury black magic
they were created in the tree
of the queen correct
thats right
why didnt they just murder him
they wanted to interrogate him
when a plague fly burrows inside
of you it breaks your will
whatever the killers wanted to know
he would have told them
buzzing
but the question remains
what did they want to know
he isnt getting up
not unless we could break the curse
and the only way to do that
is to kill the witch who cast it
the one ellic works for
dolans got two days tops
hang in there for me
death
its a message from dolan not the killer
remember your death
what does it mean
theres only one way
to remember my death

what youre giving a history lesson here
or youre just trying to scare me
theres something no one knows
about dreamwalkers
they dont need memory potions
that power lies within them
i have something buried deep
in my mind that i must remember

you know i have
a younger brother and uh
he had this knack for just pissing me off

so i ran away
what were their names
your wife and daughter
helena
elizabeth
i havent said their names
out loud in a long time
kaulder even if i wanted to help you
i wouldnt know where to begin
think of a word
that you associate with me
could be anything
empty everything else out of your head
and just focus on that one word
one word
if you tell me the word
ill focus on it too
sometimes that helps
whats the word
alone
elizabeth laughing
chloe take my hand
grosette this way men
brother dolan look
medieval dolan kaulder
grosette what is that dolan
tread with care

soldier end it brother dolan
kaulder screaming
grosette destroy her dolan
no
indistinct chatter
you kept it
its over the witch queen is dead
they betrayed you from the start
thats why they tortured your friend
because he knew where the heart was
theyre gonna bring back the queen
belial for eight hundred years
weve waited for her return
you should be honored traitor
you will be sacrificed for our cause
kaulder i know where belial
brought all that dirt
the truck he rented
had a standard gps locator
you lied to me
you saved her heart
remember your death
its not what you think
you knew what it meant all
along and you said nothing
because i wasnt going to be responsible
for the dissolution of the axe
and cross on my very first
theyre bringing back the queen
you dont know what youve done
i swore an oath to keep it secret
this lie has kept apocalypse
at bay for hundreds of years
we were afraid if the queens
heart was destroyed
youd lose your immortality or die
that wasnt your choice to make
thats what the old man thought
the night he was attacked
i think he was going to destroy it
for you
to set you free
at least the axe and cross
still has their weapon
belial you will serve the queen
max no please
like it or not
belial chanting
wood creaking
ah
go to my apartment youll be safe there
no the deal was that we stick together
im going alone if i cant trust my own
people how the hell can i trust you
this isnt who you are
its all i am
kaulder pierce her with iron
scour her by fire
bring her endless death
man coughing
ive missed you kaulder
heres what you dont understand
what your kind never understood
ive shown mercy
i could have killed every last one of you
ive done the math

kaulder grunts

okay
groans
i killed the one who cursed you
coughs
here
drink this
thank you
the witch queen has returned
i thought my immortality
was the way that she punished me
but she just used me
to save it for herself
im afraid i bear some responsibility
it was hubris to think that our secret
wouldnt be discovered by the enemy
ive seen what comes next
death
the witch queen will cast
another plague curse
havent covens with that kind
of power been destroyed
we dont destroy witches anymore
we incarcerate them
we took all the most powerful witches
that ever walked the earth
and put em in one place
the witch prison
and theyve been waiting
waiting to be released
waiting to exact revenge
we created the perfect coven
now im right back where i started
you defeated her once
you can defeat her again
kaulder
you must go
you have to fight
mechanical whirring
chloe kaulder
i never had a name for it
but my enemies
came to call it hexenbane
witch slayer

our agreement depended
on me keeping you safe
no our agreement was that
if i helped you youd keep me safe
if i get hurt now i stay hurt
where would that leave you
you know i dont care

every witch i ever caught
the queens using their power
to release the plague

the chant
no witch would be strong enough
to cast this spell alone
but the witch queens
linking their minds like a chain
so how do we stop them
every chain has a weak link
kaulder grunting
witches chanting indistinctly
chanting

no
its not his body we need to destroy
its his mind
but if he dies in his dreams
the plague will be stopped
i wish there was another way

witches continue chanting

chloe chanting indistinctly
chanting
you cling to your pathetic life

witch queen laughing

and fire
witch queen screaming
electricity crackling
sighs
fly buzzing

gasping
kaulder

sobbing
kaulder
gasping
kaulder as long as the hexen heart beats
shes never truly dead
no you cant youll die
im ready to face that reality
no there must be another way
listen to me
when i was pulled into the shadows
i saw that there were things
much worse than her
in the darkness waiting
waiting for what
the world without you
we still need you
i need you
the axe and cross betrayed me
i cant trust anyone
you can trust me
800 years ive been on this road
always hunting
always
alone
you wouldnt be
besides
you still owe me fifty thousand dollars
chuckles
five thousand
oh so were negotiating then
church bells tolling
the axe and cross would be bothered that
theyre no longer in possession
of the queens heart
i dont serve the axe and cross anymore
this time i do it for me
well its about time
you know i used to think
the universe ran in endless circles
always repeating itself
always predictable
and now
i dont know what happens next
do you know what we mortals call that
living
you know
i still need you
well then
im at your service
come on youre not getting any younger
so you ready to go or what
im driving
okay
