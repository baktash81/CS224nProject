i ll probably lose my place at bristol   
mm   
   which is a good university 
but not my dream 
do you think it matters in the long term 
or is the subject and standard of degree
more important 
so  i got married 
  what  
  to suzy  we got married 
you mean remarried 
this time it s for keeps  though 
  when did this happen 
  a few weeks ago 
i was going to invite you  but i know
how you are around people 
how am i  
awkward  weird 
i don t live in a cave 
i live in suburban london 
i spend my entire life around people 
much as i d like to 
it s almost impossible to avoid them 
see  this is what i mean 
well    was it a big wedding 
no  couple of hundred close friends
and family 
  and it was perfect 
  mm 
i can t believe you didn t invite me
to your wedding 
so  what are you up to this summer 
oh  you re changing the subject 
  mm hm 
  fine 
i dunno  i guess i ll be going on holiday 
oh  this should be good 
what have you got planned 
trans siberian express 
fossil hunting in dorset 
or maybe something even weirder 
no  actually  something normal  i m going
somewhere normal  with my normal friends 
to a place full of normal people 
and you  of course 
 sighs 
  wahhhhh
  gimme love  gimme love  gimme love
  i really need it
  gimme love  gimme love  gimme love
  just set me free  yeah     
will  in case you were wondering 
that was me with my father 
and this is where i live   not with him 
but with my mother 
it s a long story  well  not that long 
he shagged the work experience girl
and then left us 
so  just clichd  really 
plus  it only happened two years ago 
so i don t even get the luxury
of blaming my various personality defects
on their divorce 
anyway  that s how i ended up here  
the very definition of suburbia 
safe  comforting  stifling  boring  
and i couldn t wait to fucking leave 
maybe that s unfair  as they do say
that you never know what goes on
behind the net curtains of suburbia 
although  in my friend jay cartwright s
case  you can have a pretty good guess 
 lustful groans 
are you ready to have some fun  big boy 
mmm 
i m feeling sexy 
take off mask  baby  let me see you 
nah 
do you promise this ll be properly filthy 
yeah 
oh  yes  like bomb explode from in penis 
sexy like   mmm   finger up bumhole 
christ  you make me so erect 
oh  yes  you also make me erect 
now  put in card details 
oh  i m so horny 
don t forget security number and bank 
mm  come on  hurry up 
all right  jay s mum  where s jay 
oh  hello  neil  he s at home 
updating his cv 
 mobile rings 
ooh  excuse me 
hello 
ohh   
it s a bit over  is that ok 
not really 
  excuse me  my prawns 
  sorry  mate  i finish at six 
cheers for that 
  you don t have to thank me every time 
  oh  right  cool 
you re so fit 
simon  we need to talk 
oh  not talking 
  look  it s been great so far   
  it s been amazing 
literally the best year of my life 
my spots clearing up  not moving to wales 
and now you 
and i m definitely getting better
at kissing  aren t i 
i think we should break up 
what 
we re both going away to uni soon 
and it ll be too hard to keep it going
long distance 
  it won t be fair on either of us 
  i don t mind 
you will mind  though  you will 
i bloody won t 
plus  i m going on holiday soon 
so there s that 
why  what are you planning to do
on holiday 
maybe you should just go home 
i just need some space to think
at the moment 
ok  fine  so  i ll see you later  yeah 
or  whenever 
 whistles 
mum  i m back  when s tea 
  in a minute 
  it had better be delicious 
 sobs 
ohhh   
  oooh 
  oh  oh 
tell me you love me  tell me you love me 
oh  yes  i like you  oh  i like you 
get out  i m just looking at holidays 
it s just holidays 
jay  can you come downstairs  please 
your grandfather s died 
ooh  you ve got a lady there  you bad boy 
has she got nice titties  suck on
the lady s titties  suck them  go on 
will  it was our last ever day of school 
something my new stepmum had
experienced only four years ago herself 
so the head of sixth was going to say
a few inspirational words 
and if ever there was a man for the job 
it wasn t lunatic giant mr gilbert 
i will forget each and every one of you
almost immediately 
so  if you do find yourself at a loose end
next year 
and think it might be nice to pop in
and see how we re getting on 
don t  this isn t the dead poets society
and i m not that bloke on bbc two
who keeps getting kids to sing in choirs 
i especially don t want to hear about
how well you re settling down at uni
or how much growing up you ve done
in the past 12 months 
at best  i am ambivalent
towards most of you 
but some of you  i actively dislike 
for no other reason
than your poor personal hygiene
or your irritating personalities 
i hope i ve made myself clear
on this point 
and in case any of you think
i m joking   i m not 
i assure you that once my legal obligation
to look after your best interests
is removed 
i can be one truly nasty fucker 
good luck with the rest of your lives
and   try not to kill anyone 
it reflects very badly on all of us here 
slightly more upbeat than i was expecting 
will  they say your school days
are the best days of your life 
but the only way that would be true for me
would be if i went straight from school
to prison and stayed there until i died 
how many times is that
she s caught you now 
four  but this was the worst 
mask  snorkel  ham 
ok  one last one for luck 
ooooh 
good  old school wedgie 
to be admired  in a way 
squashing the balls now 
ooh  that does not tickle 
argh 
mark  what the fuck
do you think you re doing  put him down 
all right  calm down 
just saying goodbye to bender squad 
  have a nice life  dickheads 
  oh  grow up  god 
  are you ok  will 
  fine  slightly chafed arse crack 
  but  no  basically fine  thanks 
  hi  simon 
ok  well  bye  then 
fucking bitch 
is she 
no 
oh  god    i just really miss her 
 cries 
it s all right  mate  i understand 
anyone would miss those tits 
  it s not that  neil 
  is it her lovely snatch 
  no 
  i know it feels rough
now  si 
but you just need to give it some time 
i m just worried i ll never get over her 
 cries 
  i can help you with that 
  can you 
yeah  from now on  every time
you mention the moanatronic 5000 
  you get a slap in the balls 
  do you mean carli 
ow  for fuck s sake  jay 
  neil  you were warned 
  how s that helping  
stopped you from crying like a baby 
for one 
so my life is still ruined 
but now my balls ache too  thanks  jay   
no  your life is just about to begin 
mate 
now you ve been dumped  we can all go
on a mental holiday together 
two weeks of sun  sea  sex  sand  booze 
sex  minge  fanny and tits 
and booze 
and sex 
he s put it horrifically 
but he s probably right 
a holiday would definitely
take your mind off her 
jay  plus  it s the perfect time to go 
neil  yeah  they say the summer is
the perfect time for a summer holiday 
will  come on  si  what do you say 
the lads on tour 
  neil  and you 
  will  yes  and me  one of the lads 
yeah  fuck it  go on  then 
maybe it will help 
course it will  and  i promise you  si 
we ll go somewhere so full of fit birds 
it ll be like shooting clunge in a barrel 
what a lovely image   
will  so  that was it 
we were no longer schoolboys 
and  to prove our independence 
we were off on the holiday of a lifetime
without our parents   
after we d made them pay for it 
i know this is the first time you ve ever
been away from me  but don t go crazy 
when have i ever gone crazy  
that time you drank all that shandy
at debra s wedding  you went pretty wild 
  i was seven years old 
  he was running round  his pants down 
shouting   i ve got a white slug  
  mum 
  oh  hello  kevin

and you talk like a vicar 
a bloody gay vicar  or something   laughs 
well  i m not a vicar and i m not gay

bye bye  pookie petal  love you  mwah 
oh  and jay  if you re gonna spend
your grandad s money chasing skirt 
two things  one  make sure she s not
a hound like the last one 
and two  try to be a man when she dumps
you for someone with a bigger cock   
   which is everyone   laughs 
dad 
will  dads are like arseholes 
everyone s got one  yes 
but also  they re arseholes  which is why
they make excellent cab drivers 
takes me back  all this  
cheap flights at ungodly hours 
where is it you re headed to again 
simon never tells me anything 
  malia  mr cooper  in greece 
  can t say i ve heard of it 
of course you haven t 
it s a cool place to go 
and it s got a subways 
oh  right  in my day 
it was all about spain 
me and my mates went to magaluf
this one time 
  shagaluf  we called it 
   neil laughs 
should ve called it shagalot  and hard 
anything that moved 
we had a system 
always left a hat on the bedroom door
when one of us got lucky 
was usually me 
oh  dad  please shut up 
i don t know what it is 
but you ll find girls just seem to let
themselves go a bit more abroad 
it s like as soon as they smell
the sun cream  they get wet 
  your mother s the same  even now 
  oh  god  just drop us here 
will  i was learning a lot about holidays 
and not just what they did
to mrs cooper s front bottom 
i was also learning
that on a lads  holiday 
it s compulsory to wear
 hilarious  matching t shirts 
here y are 
nice 
right  you owe me 12 quid each 
except for you  will  you owe me 20 
what   why 
cos i had to bung the bloke
a few extra quid for him to make it 
right  so i ve got to pay more money
for a t shirt i didn t ask for
and i m not going to wear  cos it carries
a nickname i didn t know i had 
  yes 
  great   
 laughing 
  come on  come on  come on  come on
  got my peeps standing with me
at the bar doing shots
  cos now we re so fucking plastered
we don t know when to stop
  i got my peeps standing with me
and i m having a blast
  i m feeling so fucking good right now
i want it to last
  i m at the bar and i see this chick
checking me out
  from afar  yes  she wants my dick
there ain t a doubt
  now i m in a lift  getting lips
how dumb is this girl 
  but do i care  do i fuck 
i m on a roll  yo   
malia flight 
yep 
delay  seven hours 
and please remove those t shirts 
or we won t allow you to board the plane 
will  despite neil offering   twice  
they didn t let him drive the plane 
finally  though  we d made it on holiday 
and jay s thoughts on the beautiful isle
of crete  birthplace of zeus 
were as insightful as ever 
  i m hot 
  it is well hot 
  might be too hot 
  might be 
   car horn blares 
  oh 
carli  carli 
carls 
oh 
sorry 
 buzz of conversation 
oi  jay  jay   
tidy minge  ten o clock 
jay  jay 
didn t you see them girls 
why don t you chirps  em 
  i can t handle that many at once  neil 
  really  what about that netball team 
yeah  that was all right 
cos that was a luxury caravan 
but this coach is way too small
for my moves 
ah  course 
right  so  the plan is
get to the apartment  unpack 
get some sleep 
then head out fresh tomorrow 
first up  the minoan palace at knossos 
jay  have you come on a lads  holiday
by mistake  
we haven t come halfway round the world to
look at some boring fucking greek ruins 
yeah  you can see that shit anywhere 
we go there  drop the bags off 
then go straight out and get spasticated 
simples 
but i ve not slept for 37 hours 
shut up and try and get
some sleep on here  then 
fine  good idea 
   engine starts 
    we love you burnley  we do
  we love you burnley  we do
  we love you burnley  we do
oh  burnley  we love you 
    oh  burn a ley
    oh  burn a ley
    is wonderful
    oh  burn a ley is wonderful     
  can you hear the preston sing 
i can t hear a fucking thing     
will  when people ask me if i like
football  i say yes  i do like football 
but not burnley 
burnley can fuck off 
  come on  burnley   
  oh  burn a ley is wonderful   
will  it was a tense moment 
someone was obviously staying here 
right  then  mckenzie party 
this is you 
 burnley fans cheering 
good one  fellas  don t worry 
it ll look nice when it s finished 
    oh  burn a ley 
    oh  burn a ley   
  is wonderful     
this don t look like the pictures 
will  i still don t know how the dog died 
i can only presume it threw itself
in the well  rather than stay here 
you willy 
yes 
your key  you have fun 
but not too much fun 
you shit on floor   50 euro fine 
each time 
all right  lads 
  are you stopping here 
  yes  we are 
bad luck  i ve just come back
from afghanistan 
and conditions there
are better than this shithole 
i can t wait to get back to lying
in a dusty trench 
being shot at by some raghead 
are you married 
  no 
  don t get married 
the wife booked this  but somehow 
it s my fucking fault 
anyway  pop down for a beer if you fancy 
i ll see youse later 
hey 
you owe me 50 euros 
will  as we entered our new home 
wondering
if our human rights
had been breached 
i couldn t help thinking
a shit on the floor
might have
cheered the place up a bit 
  jay and neil  shotgun this room 
  shotgun the sofa bed 
well  where am i gonna sleep then  
not really my problem 
what s that  is that the bath 
course it s not the bath 
you fucking idiot  there s the bath 
that s the   kids  toilet 
  is it 
  yes 
why s it got a plughole and a tap  then 
cos it s for checking your kid s shit
before you flush it 
  urgh  that s grim 
  yeah  i know 
that s the continentals  innit 
they re dirty 
see  that looks nice 
i m not sleeping in a fucking bathtub
for two weeks  simon 
we ll have to share the sofa bed 
 high pitched  ooh   ello 
right  well  while you two decide
who gets first go on each other s cocks 
i m getting ready and getting out there 
the gash isn t gonna fuck itself 
you know 
charming   
 jay screams 
will  finally  smelling like an industrial
accident at the lynx factory 
and looking like the world s
shittest boy band  we hit the town 
  ooh  heads down  boys 
  neil  shit 
what  why  we haven t done anything 
  foreign police  innit 
  so 
don t you even know about foreign police 
what  short sleeved uniforms 
chunkier truncheons 
  oh  fucking hell 
  mate  they re all corrupt 
basically  if you misbehave
and don t have the money to bribe  em 
they take you up
to these shepherds  huts in the hills
beat you up and bum ya 
and if they don t kill ya 
you kill yourself 
cos of the shame of getting a boner
whilst you was being bummed 
right  couple of things  firstly 
the hills here are full of timeshares 
not deserted shepherds  huts 
secondly  crete s in the eu 
so i think the standard of policing
probably goes beyond bumming
and forced suicide 
believe what you want  i m keeping
a bribe up my arse just in case 
you re gonna spend the whole holiday with
20 euros rolled up inside your arsehole 
it s been up there since
the seatbelt signs went off  mate 
all right  lads  holiday  is it  i m out
here on my own  having a mental time 
can i have a beer 
  oh  here you go  mate 
  no  you can t 
all right  which is it 
you say yes  he says bloody no 
  he s not your boss  is he  eh 
  sorry    do we know you 
anyways  here s a good one for you  right 
get a torch and walk along the beach at
night and you get to watch people fucking 
they re all drunk and you get to see
tits and cocks and that 
if you re into cocks 
which it looks like he is  ha ha 
well  it s been great talking to you 
but we ve really got to get a move on 
can i come round yours for a shower 
um  no 
no  cool beans  see you later  lads 
richard  yeah  richard 
will  well  richard was clearly mental 
but  as we were about to discover 
so was everything else here 
  this place about to blow
  blow
  this place about to blow
  blow
  this place about to blow
  this place about to blow     
will  while simon was seeing carli
everywhere 
  jay was seeing some very lucky ladies 
  she d get it 
neil  most definitely 
oh  and that one  she d get it 
  and that one  and that one 
  and that one  she d get it 
right in the bumholey 
i can t believe i ve already got a bird 
gutted 
so fucking what   all birds know  
what goes on tour stays on tour 
no  i couldn t do that to nicole 
i think i love her 
and i never loved anything before
apart from a car or a sandwich 
if the build up gets too much for you  you
can always borrow one of my johnnies 
have a wank royale 
  oh  cheers  jay 
  a what  
a wank royale  a wank with a johnny on 
it s a bit more expensive 
so i tend to save it

yeah  we re always up for a good time 
we re the pussay patrol 
all right  well  if you really are

but this year   never 
thanking you  very much 
ok  let s go 
fuck off  my bird ll be down in a minute 
you mean the woman who s clearly
on commission to trick people
into this empty bar 
no  i mean the little hottie outside
that i was flirting with 
i ll take that as a yes  then 
i m going nowhere
till she s sucked me off 
  so  you re going nowhere 
  will  jay  we re on holiday 
i m meant to be out there  trying to
hit on girls that i think are beneath me 
but who  for their part  won t give me
the time of day  so  let s go 
ooh  hello  hello 
it s those little lovelies from the coach 
  that one s not so little 
  i think they re looking at us 
and not in a weird  terrified 
 leave us alone  way  amazing 
jay  you re drunkest 
go over and talk to them 
nah  not me  mate 
none of them are as fit as my one outside 
why go for hamburgers 
when you ve got steak at home 
if  like you  you have neither anywhere 
it s up to you  then  si 
shit  really 
i don t know if i m over carli 
ow  fuck  can you stop that  
yes  i can  when you stop being
such a pussy about your ex 
it s time to get back
on the horse now  si 
and those little ponies need feeding 
feed the pony 
yeah  ok  i ll introduce us 
but we ve all got to go over together 
  great 
  you fucking sad cases 
you don t just walk up to a girl in a club
and introduce yourself  that s creepy 
clubs are different rules  you dick 
look  you dance over near them  make
the eyes  then get  em to dance with you 
really  
  annoyingly  that does sound right 
  thank you 
and then  after a bit 
you stand up behind them 
pretend to slap  em
and fuck  em up the arse 
  that might be a bit much 
  yeah  i dunno   
oh  fucking hell  i ll do it 
  what about nicole 
  it s only dancing  she likes my dancing 
stick with me  you ll be fine 
right  then  si 
looks like the holiday starts here 
   yolanda be cool 
we no speak americano 
am i doing it right  am i in time 
maybe a bit out  but not so you d notice 
copy neil 
sorry  do you mind
if we come and talk to you 
cos you look nice and  frankly  this is
just humiliating for everyone involved 
um   
sit down  specs 
hello  i m lucy 
hi  i m diamond    simon  i m simon 
i d better not get stuck with the fat one 
so  when alison initially suggested malia 
we all thought  yeah  why not 
it ll be ironic 
then we had a reality check
and we thought  do we honestly wanna spend
two weeks somewhere being ironic 
and obviously the answer was no 
so then we looked at other places 
but we realised  actually  we just want to
have a laugh and go clubbing and get drunk
and be silly  and that this might
genuinely be a good place to come 
so fuck it  here we are 
just so you know  i ve met a really
fit bird and she ll be along any minute 
ok  she won t mind you talking to me 
then  will she 
will  if our dancing was bad  
and it was bad   
then our small talk was even worse 
sorry  will you excuse us a moment 
  what s going on 
  what do you mean  
what do you think i mean  
why aren t you talking to the girls 
i get  like  words making sounds
in my head  but they don t come out 
well  that s easy to fix  just say them 
move your mouth and say them 
well  i can t pork any of them anyways 
cos of nicole 
but it would be nice to make a connection 
like on them tv shows 
when people make a connection 
oh  this is hopeless 
well  i don t exactly see you
charming your way into their knickers 
i just danced for the first time
in my life 
it s hard to know what to follow up with 
maybe you could pretend to not have
the personality you ve got 
like   pretend to be someone cool 
thanks  simon  thank you  big help   
yeah  actually 
it s probably best you don t even try 
no  i am going to try 
if anything  i m gonna try too hard 
she is well out of your league 
like well  well  well out of your league 
so  all girls i like are out of my league 
what s the point of going for girls
in my league 
look at me  imagine my league 
oh  god 
er  jay  mate 
i think you missed the toilet 
are you saying i can t hold my drink 
you are pissing your drink
all over the floor 
so  it s still the toilet 
this whole room s the toilet 
neil  can you chuck me a paper towel 
ah  wipe the drip from my knob 
birds don t like it when it tastes pissy 
ok  come on  guys  we ve done
the hard bit  let s not fuck this up 
i just can t think of what to say 
just talk about something you love 
something you re passionate about 
right  oh  cool  got it 
i know exactly what to say 
it s pretty devastating 
cos she s definitely
the most beautiful girl i ve ever met 
she s so fascinating 
she s really funny  you know 
oh  right  in what sort of way 
just like    you know when something s
funny and people get it 
yes 
so  in that way 
and  also  in a comedy way 
will  neil was a man of few words 
but even for him  this was ridiculous 
not that i was faring
that much better myself 
so  do this place hire you out as
some sort of avant garde dance troupe
to scare the customers off 
no  i lost my mind and agreed to come here
on holiday  what s your excuse 
sort of similar 
i came out here earlier this summer and
fell crazy in love with a gorgeous local 
  so now i m back 
  hilarious  course you did 
what was he  a barman or a waiter 
  waiter 
  brilliant  was he called stavros 
  nicos 
  too good 
i bet he s different to all the boys
back home 
yeah  he understands women  for one 
i m sure he does 
must get enough practice 
will  not only had jay not offered

his grandmother has a moustache as well 
if that makes the stereotype even funnier

every other waiter out here 
it s fine  you don t know
what you re talking about 
your accent was pretty good  though 
oh  i ve gotta go  don t want to miss
my stereotypical greek boyfriend 
he might get angry and smash some plates 
or commit atrocities in anatolia 
you re not normal  are you

where s that bloke you were dancing with 
  i ve got nothing but love for you
  i ve got nothing but love for you

chatted up some girls 
they loved it and you didn t fuck it up

they ve got paper cuts

of us getting back together

there are north korean prison camps
which are nicer than our hotel 
but  like a north korean prison camp  it
was overcrowded  so we had nowhere to sit

my head s more fucked

phallus burning itself onto my skin

to make a girl feel special  don t you

the full force of jay s boyish charm 
can you move  you re blocking the sun 
charming 
what s happened to your face  jay 
it s a food allergy 
i could do with one of those 
maybe an iced bun allergy 
yeah  you could 
meanwhile  neil had
a surprise in store for lisa 
forgot my trunks 
fancy a swim 
oh  leave it out  you little prick 
right  that s it 
i m going to fucking kill ya 
  i m going to fucking kill ya 
  oi 
those are our sunbeds 
and where s our towels 
oh  good 
well  there weren t any towels
when we arrived
and we ve been here for the last hour 
i didn t ask to read your fucking diary 
love  i said   where s our towels  
now  there s no need to be abusive 
if you look around 
there are signs everywhere
saying you can t reserve sunbeds 
so you moved our towels 
the point i m making is 
whatever the fate of the towels 
these cannot be your beds 
what have you done
with my fucking towels  
sir  i get you nice other beds  please 
take up your stuff 
me   what 
why should we move 
because he s made a scene 
because his family are too lazy
to walk 20 feet to the pool 
seriously  mate  i am warning you 
why have a rule
if you aren t going to enforce it 
the signs are redundant 
 whimpering 
my towel   cries 
disabled  course she is 
here you go 
  happy now 
  well  obviously not 
 screeches 
and that isn t helping 
you lot have got five seconds
to get off my sunbeds 
right  come on  will 
we ll just find somewhere else 
but i still don t see
why we should move 
yes  his daughter
has a serious condition 
but it s not like the whole family
are therefore entitled
to pool side seats for life 
plus  strictly speaking 
she doesn t even need another chair 
are you guests at this hotel 
ah  no  i no swim 
please  mister  i no swim  i beg you 
not pool 
argh 
all right  all right 
it s just a joke  we re    we re mates 
 gasping and laughter 
so little  so little 
ah 
great 
and with a rough grab
from a bo ridden security guard 
simon s perfect plan came crashing down 
  thanks a lot  jay 
  me   what have i done 
oh  i don t know    oh  yeah 
fucked everything up for me 
like you always do 
i had to teach him a lesson  si 
he was mugging me off 
he was nine years old and couldn t swim 
  now my life is ruined  thanks 
  is this about the tickets 
oh  boo hoo hoo 
so  you don t get to go
to the boat party  so what  
so i don t get back together
with the woman i love 
look  it s not my fault
carli thinks you re a prick 
you want to watch me more closely  mate 
  you might actually learn something 
  oh  yeah 
and what would i learn 
how to bullshit about having sex 
how to sleep in an ants  nest 
  how to be scared shitless of my dad  
  oh  come on  si  calm down 
maybe you d learn not to be such
a massive tool over that miserable cunt 
don t call carli a cunt 
 panting 
  you had enough yet  
  have you had enough yet 
  i asked first 
  ah   
  uh 
  we should do something 
yeah  do you want to go

i mean  why do i even
hang round with him 
well  yeah  obviously
we all wonder that at times 
look  it s been a tough couple of days 
the carli thing is weird 
but just cos you were
in a fight with jay 
  you don t have to leave 
  i m not leaving 
but you are aware
you re packing your suitcase 
  i ve never liked him

and his hair 
everyone took the piss out of that 
but not me  i didn t 
fucking wish i had now 
  you did a bit 
  well  no  course  a bit 
but   not enough 
he s a total twat 
oh  that s harsh  mate 
he can be a knob  but he s not a twat 
  i m going to sell my clothes 
  oh  you re having a breakdown 
she means so much to me  will 
i don t care about anything else 
if i can get enough money together 
i can buy a ticket
for the boat party off someone 
somehow  whatever it costs 
money is all i need 
i agree with you on money 
but who s going to buy your clothes 
no of fence  but you dress appallingly 
are you going to help
or just constantly undermine me

13 years he s been dragging me down 
well   fuck him

jay and neil
as they rolled up the sleeves
on their offensive t shirts
and dived straight back in 
 pounding dance music 
this place is mental 
it s decadent  neil 
that s what they call it 
this is what we came here for 
you wouldn t find those other
two muppets in a place like this 
they d just shit themselves
and run away 
announcer  and now all the way

the master of self fellatio 
 cheering

simon  i wasn t thinking about you 
jane  hi  guys 
taking a break from drowning children 
we are 
and welcome back to malia s
least cool bar

surprised to see you here again

where the blokes weren t total animals 
i ll take that as a compliment 
hello  by the way 
hello  spectacles 
still going to get shit faced  though 
shots only 
  are you man enough  jay bo 
  course 
thought you would be 
obviously we now rated as
so sexually non threatening
that these girls were happy
to drink with us 
but to be fair 
i d take that every time 
so i ve been thinking  about us   
  what  the four of you 
  no  me and you 
well  there is no  us  
so that must have been a weird
thought process  but go on 
  i m not sure nicos is right for you 
  interesting 
why wouldn t my sexy  charming 
caring boyfriend 
who is also a sensational lover 
  be right for me 
  you d say sensational  would you 
  mmm 
  mmm 
it was nice of richard branson
to lend you an outfit 
it s neil s  is it really that bad 
well  at least you look fantastic 
right  there s only one thing for it 
we re going to say   fuck it  
and do shots until one of us is sick
through our nose  my money s on me 
four monkey brains  please

thanks very much 
  cheers 
  cheers

you re one to talk about lightweights 
what do you mean 
oh  cos i m fat 
no 
what i   mean  jane  is   
i m gonna drink you under the table 
you re trouble  aren t you 
you re funny 
that is why i know you don t have
to worry about getting laid 
um  did i say i was worried 
no  but it s obvious that you are 
and you think
that somehow i m the answer 
well  i am not  and you will be fine 
i think you might be  though 
nonsense 
you know  in fact  i am so confident
i will make a pact with you 
if you still haven t had sex
by this time next year 
i ll have sex with you 
as long as i m not with nicos 
of course 
of course 
um   
this is a joke  right 
a handshake s good   
is it possible to get it in writing 
see  funny 
yes  ha ha ha  hmm 
you all right  lise  where s neil 
he is literally incredible 
come on  lise 
we re getting out of here 
let s go for a swim  come on  you 
you coming swimming

  if i know jane  probably  yeah 
  really 
  fucking hell  really  
  yes 
and   
   what about you 
well  i m meeting nicos in half an hour 
course 
so i reckon i ve got time
for a quick dip 
alison was hopelessly out of my league 
and yet  and yet   
no  i had no fucking chance 
 giggles 
come on  what are you doing 
get it off 
no  yeah  good  i will 
go on  then 
all in good time 
i ll look away  if you like 
um  yeah  that would be nice  thank you

simon was tricked into getting naked 
further along the beach 
for the first time ever  jay was close
to seeing some naked women
not on a computer screen 
come on  jay  don t be shy 
i ll take it all off if you will 
um  all right  just   give me a minute 
are you scared that you won t be able
to control yourself 
man  she s a big girl  she is a big girl 
can t take it any more 
just give us a snog 
um   all right 
but   let s go somewhere secret 
secret 
just give us a snog here 
nah 
let s go somewhere
people can t see us 
  ok 
  fucking whale on the beach 
actually   forget it 
i ve already seen your cock 
and it wasn t pretty 
all i m saying is that  logically 
we might not have to wait
a year to have sex 
  oh  really 
  yeah 
i mean  once you remove nicos from the
equation and think  as i say  logically 
it really makes no sense
to wait that long 
do you find that your logic
talks a lot of girls into bed 
well  no 
i was just curious to know
whether this kind of relentless  pedantic
chat is a big hit with the other chicks 
  well  obviously  it isn t 
  thought not 
what are you waiting for 
um   i don t know 
ok 
 sighs  take your clothes off

about how shit the holiday is 
partly that  partly i m thinking
about putting stones in my pockets
and chucking myself in the pool 
oh  i wouldn t swim in that  it s rank 
right 
also  if you put stones in your pockets 
you ll sink  so   better to not
have the stones  really 
i ll bear that in mind  neil 
i stopped believing in god when
i realised it was just  dog  backwards 
what 
well  when you think about it  
g o d  d o g 
it s like an anagram 
but a backwards one  innit 
right 
and then  after that 
i just stopped worrying about stuff 
you only get one go round  i reckon 
when you re dead  you re dead 
so you can spend your time thinking
about how things haven t gone perfect
or you can just get on with it 
have a laugh and that 
that s what i do  i m pretty happy 
you are  aren t you 
yeah 
thanks  neil  thanks for that 
just remember  it s d o g backwards 
no  not that 
no of fence  but that s moronic 
no  thanks for coming to cheer me up 
i didn t come to cheer you up 
i come to say i did a shit
in the children s toilet
and i can t get rid of it 
oh  god 
cos i thought i d try something
different  you know  as a treat 
  oh   
  oh 
oh 
neil  what the fuck has gone into that 
have you been eating tear gas 
no  it s just a bit beery 
and that meatiness
is probably the kebabs 
ok  that s it  neil  you were right 
it may not be paradise 
but we can at least try and enjoy
this place for exactly what it is 
a shithole 
yes  but it s our shithole 
so let s get out there
and get royally fucked up
on jay s dead grandad s money 
it s what he would have wanted 
if we get fined 50 euros  neil 
you re paying it 
  but it s not on the floor 
  some of it is on the floor 
well  yeah  some of it 
   mike skinner  clunge in a barrel 
  i know you re there
  it s my sound
  it s my    it s my

my grandad s money
to set us up in business 
selling car stereos
to premiership footballers 
neil was going
to work in the depot  but   
me  you and rio ferdinand are on sales 
like  having a laugh and that 
oh  right

  what tickets 
  boat party ones 
i bought them when i was pissed the
other night  i thought i d surprise you 
  oh  well 
  you what    you tore them up  
  yeah 
  what  after we had the fight 
yeah  i   i was angry

you fucking arsehole 
yeah  you want me
to fucking mash you up again

  yeah 
  yeah 
  yeah 
oh  you two   can t i even have a piss
out of the end of my cock in peace 
you two go on 
i m just going to have
a little recovery snooze 
come on  mate 
you can have my bed tonight 
this one s a bit bitey 
did i tell you i touched a boob tonight 
like    like a real boob 
a girl s one 
i didn t get to lick it  though 
this has been the best night of my life 
it was the day of the boat party 
and it looked like literally
everyone in malia had a ticket 
well  everyone except me and simon 
whose mood was now bluer than his balls 
if i could  i d give you my ticket  si 
you can  just give me your ticket 
yeah  but i really want to go 
so you see  actually  i can t 
  take jay s ticket 
  no  i think he needs it 
what  cos of jane 
no  in case the captain dies
and they need me to drive the boat 
 groaning 
eased up on the vomiting 
mainly retching now 
for the record  they don t clean
that toilet floor very often 
lots of pubes on hands  knees   
and my face
when i had a little lie down 
i cannot believe we ve been eating here 
wow  they look hot 
  bit young for you  ain t they  neil 
  behave 
lucy  lucy 
alison  aliso   
oh  i give up 
all right  boys  who killed will 
 groans 
  what s up with lucy 
  i don t know 
if you ask her rather than
talking about your ex the whole time 
  you might find out 
  oh  god  really 
fine 
  you coming to the boat party  then 
  you try and stop me 
we just saw two hot fellas
dressed as firemen getting on board 
might need a hand with their hoses 
might have to set fire to my knickers 
  i ll come with you  if you like 
  no  thank you 
come on  lisa 
you look as bad on the outside
as i feel on the inside 
oh  don t worry 
i feel like shit on the inside too 
although   
i don t have a pube on my cheek 
oh  god 
anyway  seeing you in such a mess
has at least cheered me up a bit 
glad to be of service 
you know i have a penis
sunburnt on my back too 
must be reassuring to know
that however bad life gets 
you re not me 
it is 
good  that means every time you re down 
you have to come and hang out with me 
yeah  i think i might 
starting with today 
i ve got nicos s ticket
for the boat party 
do you fancy joining me 
um  yes 
more than anything 
great  on one condition  though 
anything 
at no point are you allowed
to say   i told you so  
ooh  not sure i can guarantee that 
so it s not that i d rather go
to a party that infinitely heightens
my sense of being out of kilter
with the rest of the world 
it s just that alison is sort of
the fittest girl i ve ever met
  and maybe   
  it s fine  will  honestly 
go for it  i ll just find a quiet spot
and hang myself 
great  lucy  make sure
he doesn t hang himself 
i m off  look at me 
following my cock like a normal person 
sorry for saying cock 
i didn t realise
i was being such a dick 
you were 
  i m trying to say sorry 
  well  say it  then 
sorry 
for being a dick 
sorry for being a dick 
and for having too much gel
in your hair 
i don t think i ve got that much   
ok  i m sorry for having
too much gel in my hair 
you should probably get going 
i m not that bothered 
really 
yeah 
if you like  maybe we could hang out 
the two of us 
i quite fancy just staying by the pool 
yeah  i mean  why spend the day
having unbelievable fun on the party boat
when you could be taking a depressed man
swimming at a family hotel 
i m serious 
i don t mind 
i might even cheer you up   
if they let you back in 
i honestly don t think
i ll be very good company 
but thanks for the offer 
you go  i ll be all right 
look   
it s obvious how much
carli means to you 
she s lucky   
i think 
i m sure you ll sort it out 
she goes back tomorrow 
i can feel her slipping away 
simon   
if she really means that much to you 
i want you to take my ticket 
lucy   
if you really want to go  take it 
if you really want to go 
god  you d do that for me 
yeah 
thanks 
i ll see you later 
enjoy the pool  will 
will  i got a ticket  i got a ticket 
will 
i got a ticket  i got a ticket 
  we are go 
  the time has come to leave this place
  leave it all behind
  there s so much more here to envision
  out of your mind     
will  the boat party
was jay s promised land   
sun  sea  booze  and who knows 
maybe even some sex  minge 
fanny and tits   and booze   and sex 
mental 
  cheeky shot to get us started 
  you are kidding 
oh  come on  it s the best cure 
fair enough  what are we toasting 
to the pussay

  fuck off 
fine  well  i m going off
to find her  anyway 
  oh  si  i forgot something 
  what 
ah  for fuck s sake 
you know i should probably find jane 
i promised her a dance 
  what 
  well  no  just a dance 
and then we can get
some proper fit gash 
but jane s all right  you know 
she s a laugh 
the fat ones are always jolly 
neil  what a horrible thing to say 
  just you and me  then  will 
  oh  no 
oh  god 
what was i thinking  tequila

sorry 
make your bloody mind up  you wally 
 sighs 
richard  all right  mate

yeah  not too bad 
i was djing at this techno club  right 
and this mental emo bird
comes over to me and says 
 i want you to piss on me
and then fuck me  
so i pissed all over her 
and then fucked her 
no  she was covered in piss 
oh  course 
anyway  the other day  right 
i started crying and couldn t stop

oh

we find somewhere a little more private 
  i don t mind 
  i told you 
i do  and  to be fair  in private
you might get a blow job out of it 
  simey 
  oh  hi 
carli 
where have you been 
  i ve been looking all over for you 
  i need to tell you something 
ssh  i know 
get it all up

sorry 
it s fine 
i mean  what a total twat 
me

and utter greek twat

she must have been at least 30 
i told you so 
you arsehole  you had to say it 
didn t you 
even in the fucking state you re in 
  you couldn t resist 
  sorry  but at least i m consistent 
yes  you are  aren t you 
ok  so i think i d like
to revise my offer 
how about instead of having sex
with you in a year 
i have sex with you all year 
what 
  it s a one time offer 
  to confirm 
do you mean like a girlfriend
or like a prostitute 
i was thinking more like a girlfriend 
  could you write it   
  no  i am not going to write it down 
look  what i m trying to say is 
i like you 
despite myself  i really do like you 
if you like me too  then we re on 
um   but not till you ve
brushed your teeth 
oh 
  that should do it 
  you know we could do this for ever 
yeah  i know  yeah 
oh  god  carls  i thought i d lost you 
i thought i d lost you 
and no matter how many times they hit me
in the balls  i knew i was right 
and i ve worked it all out 
it was so simple 
i ll just get a job near your uni
for three years 
four if you do an ma 
and then we can be together for ever 
for ever 
just like we should be 
carli   
   what s wrong 
did you hear what i said 
something about being hit in the balls 
well  yeah  but   
mainly about being together for ever 
sorry  simon 
could you just kiss me again 
sorry  carls  this is wrong 
what 
i ve made a bad choice today 
i honestly wish you
all the best with your life 
but right now  i have to leave 
i don t think you ll ever see me again 
but i ll see you at your mum s birthday
in two weeks  time 
well  yeah  but then after that 
and then your brother s 16th
the following week 
yeah  it was more
of a metaphorical thing 
  anyway  i ll see you around  carls 
  yes 
  at your mum s 
  please  can i just   
thank you 
below deck  neil was being as faithful
as ever to his girlfriend 
by aggressively dry humping lisa
to within an inch of her life 
neil   
neil  stop 
what s up  is it my zip 
i can undo it  if you want 
no  it s not that 
i just think this is wrong 
i feel bad for your girlfriend 
  no  it s fine  we aren t kissing 
  yeah  but   
look at what we are doing 
i mean  how do you think you d feel
if you saw her doing this with a guy 
i wouldn t want to be treated like this 
  i ve got ethics 
  yeah 
yeah  you re right 
it s just that  um   
   nicole dumped me
before we got out here
and i didn t want to say anything
to the others cos i was embarrassed 
  oh  neil   
  yeah 
she sent me this text  saying like 
 you dance like a twat  you are dumped  
it broke me up 
so   this is fine and  if you want 
we can even kiss 
oh  neil 
is that true  really 
yeah  course 
if you like 
that was just    i mean   
did it not taste funny 
cos it looks funny 
all right  mate  who s this  then 
hi  i m jane 
  she s my girlfriend 
  oh  is she 
fuckin  hell  you want to be careful
she doesn t fall overboard
  cos   
  cos i ll get harpooned 
cos they might think i m a new island 
cos all the water will splash out
onto the land 
i ve heard them all  take your pick 
fuckin   ell  tubs  all right 
it was only a joke 
anyway  seeing as you re coming
out there like a naughty boy 
how about you do me a favour 
i need a note for the old toot 
we weren t doing drugs  actually 
christ  for his sake  i hope you were 
there are laws against fucking cow 
mate  even in greece 
now  i m going to need to take that note
off you  you re a mate 
you don t mind  do you 
give 
no  no  not at all 
there you are  mate  already rolled 
cheers  i ll keep this  yeah 
no problemo 
will  i think the government s
anti drugs campaign
would be more successful
if they pointed out
that every now and again 
there s a small chance you might
accidentally snort some poo 
 retches 
simon 
  are you all right 
  yeah 
yeah  for the first time in my life 
i think i actually am 
i m clear  anyway 
how d it go with carli 
long term   good  short term   horrific 
have you murdered her 
no  but i am starting to think
that maybe carli s not all that 
well  it s taken a while 
  better late than never 
  i think lucy might be the one 
yes  obviously
