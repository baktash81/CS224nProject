hathaway cell search
hands behind you
open 16
go go go
search everything
get off that
hey
take him down
one two three up
stay strong carnal
this was found
in your cell
you added 900 to all your
pals commissary accounts
in your cell block
is this the attack tool
with it
you open up a terminal
and that gives
you a command line
that how you broke into the network
and plussedup the balances
no
i used it to call santa
in the north pole
and told him to do
christmas early this year
what do we know
about this guy
his grandfather was
a military commander
in shanghai in the 20s
in the 30s against the
japanese through the civil war
his father became
chinas undersecretary
for trade to the un
he came with to new york
bronx high school
of science mit
his sisters a network engineer
in the private sector
she grow up
in new york too
no
hes a rising star in plas
cyber defense section
liaise with them
its inviting them
into the henhouse carol
stanley we go headtohead
with the chinese
on their cyber intrusion
every day of the week
not a bad idea to be facetoface
working with them for once
you monitor very closely what they
do and do not have access to
okay
okay
send the code
okay
lets go somewhere we can talk
hey hey
english might be better
come on
tomorrow i cant
its impossible
why not
ive got
an opticaloverlay network
thats got to be up
in 17 days
they sent me
some code tonight
the black hat who hit
the chai wan reactor
when i looked at the
code it was uh
and
i have to have a network
engineer with me i can trust
really trust
like 100
when do we leave
the meltdown in china
and the runup in soy yesterday
was facilitated
by the same rat
how it got loaded in
in the first place
we dont know
but once inside
it decloaked and
became what it really is
a remote access tool
a rat
the rats job was to open a back
door in our system and call home
the black hat then used his back
door to inject a second part
its payload
that is what rode up soy
now that were looking at the
rat and payload closely
were thinking
they were
written by different authors
how we figured that out
was through the coding in the rat
though several years old
it is lean graceful
the payloads coding
on the other hand
feels frenetic confused
frenetic
or overwritten
so the question
were dealing with is
is there somewhere
we can talk
and if it is two
they may not be working
in close proximity
daniels is qualified
in computer forensics
an intern could have
written that report
oh really
and who do we need
if not daniels
and liaise in liaison
group implies mutuality
you dont like our boy
what ideas are you
bringing to the dance
a man named hathaway
hes a convicted hacker
serving 15 years in usp
canaan in waymart
pennsylvania
you telling me
some hacker in prison
is hitting our
financial markets
no but we want
hathaway on the team
so he can help out
the investigation
he hit four
major banks
ran up 46 million
in damages
and thats just
what we know about
you want the doj to do
anything other than laugh
daniels said two authors
wrote the virus
i dont know who
wrote the second half
but the first half the rat
the remote access tool that daniels
called lean and graceful
one of the original authors
is me
i cowrote it
as a gag
years ago at mit
and my roommate
the genius lead author
nicholas hathaway
thats right
the hacker found the rat
online and modified it
if we want to move
around within this code
looking for clues to
the hackers identity
we need its lead architect
the reactor in china
i heard about
but the spike
in soy futures
all right
i didnt know any of this
we dont get a lot
of new news in here
the us government would like
your technical advice on this
in exchange for that
were going to furlough
you right out of here
you sign that
on the last page
and well get
you processed
youll wear
an ankle bracelet
and be accompanied
by a us marshal
your computer access
will be restricted
if you wanna study
the whole document
you can go right ahead
i can come back
in a month or two
no im done
you didnt sign it
yeah
why would i sign it why
because of the generosity
of the assistant us attorney
in granting you a furlough
both you and
the assistant us attorney
can stick that
document up your ass
im sorry
why are you sorry
i insulted you
what are you sorry for
im not sorry
dont think youre gonna
hey
you wanna raise
me up out of here
solve your trade
exchange dilemma
and i get a furlough
for a couple of weeks
you kidding me
you have any idea how much
progress youre gonna make
on a strike this complex
without someone like me
zero
this isnt a negotiation
i just made it one
you want me
you pass this upstairs
if my assistance results
in the identification
and the apprehension
of the guy youre after
i want you to commute
my sentence
if i come up empty
you toss my ass
back in the can
those are the terms
guard
interviews over
barrett how badly
do you need this guy
its so good
to see you bro
not half as much as it
is for me to see you
lets get out of here
so you planned to reunite with your
friend from the moment you landed
it entered my mind
you okay
yeah im fine
okay please keep
them out of sight
if you can help it
see he ripped off
and repurposed our code
what the hell is this
what
the agreement was an approval
and a presence for
his computer access
i approved it
a doj approval
now youre changing
the goalposts
hola chica
you came to me
how am i supposed
to do my work
on an abacus
or something
chica
am i hispanic
what the hells going on
i advocated
getting you over here
i pulled every string to get your
convicted felon sprung mr chen
captain chen
and i didnt ask
i offered partnership
an equivalent
or we would do it
on our own
well ill be happy
to bust him back to canaan
and put your ass on the
first plane back to china
he apologizes
my brother misunderstood
our arrangement
special agent
look around
i have to run
the morning backup
your network is sitting
behind deep packet inspection
intrusion protection
its extensively
firewalled
exactly
so somebody had to physically enter
this room and plug the virus in
we reviewed keycard
scans and surveillance tapes
there was no
unauthorized entry
now were thinking about
a routing weakness
thats too complicated
he wouldnt have done that
yeah well
what youre proposing
didnt happen
theres only one person whos
authorized to access these terminals
me
and my password
is my thumbprint
may i
sure
can i have some
approval now
all right
this is the code for our rat
see its compact
its slick
under a meg
you would never
have picked up on it
ever leave that
usb drive on your desk
i suppose so
who works here
who doesnt like you
recently hired fired
no
who
lozano
his mother passed away
he left two weeks ago
john lozano
he was only
on the job for a month
he have access to your office
yes
ill pull his
employment records
everything will
come up phony
except this
you got his photo id
yeah
this section of his code
right here is a mess
theres 25 lines
hes left text
it looks incomplete
are they notes to himself
deadend ideas
maybe hes still writing
yeah thats good
so if youve got the ability
to move a commodity
any way you want
what do you do
i play it out long and lowkey
i do not do one big spike
instead id play it
out month after month
less risk of detection
yeah right
but our guy jacks soy
250 in a day
mmmhmm
its flashy he knows
hes gonna bring down heat
maybe he needs cash
fast
hes got the money
from the soy runup
and hes busy writing
code for whats next
i think the real hit
is still to come
we have lozanos photo
whats on his neck
kid had tattoos
you have any
routine surveillance tapes
right there
face of stone
pollack
its me
can you have someone
jump on the ncic database
search for latino males
under 30 with priors in
i dont know
anything like carding
identity theft
who were in west texas
prison gangs
our cowboy has a tattoo
on his shoulder
hes with los zapotecas
im sending you
something right now
thats him
in the bottom left
alonzo reyes
did two years in
huntsville for carding
paroled moved back to la
ill have la pick him up
hes gonna monitor
his home grid i did
we got a better shot getting a
first look at him ourselves
isnt that why
you brought me here
okay
yeah go ahead
that means you and
me are on the money
unless you think you can
do that on your own too
i do okay
you do huh
lets see how you handle
the financial sector
thanks stanley
my eyes on you
where do you think
im going
this guy is one step away from
my get out of jail free card
so
how can i help
we want to see
your trading records
of your traders who took large
profits from the soy runup
youre requesting
i turn over records
to the fbi
and a foreign power
on thousands of private
brokers and traders
afraid i cant possibly
accommodate you
youre gonna protect the person
who manipulated your market
no youre casting
your net way too wide
mr chen
you want to see my data
you come up with something
a little more tangible
something more in the way
of probable cause
than your hunch
gary
may i call you gary
hows this for tangible
in the next 15 seconds
i call laura greer
at the commodities
trading commission
and i say
laura how you doing
id like to launch an official
investigation on one gary baker
so the headline
mtech official investigated for
aiding and abetting cyber criminals
leaks to cnn
in the next 90
so it makes the three
oclock news cycle
as well as
the nightly news
thatd be good too
am i being tangible
gary
look around here
but i stay here with you
no take nothing
hey mi carnal
what happened to you
he has wrt hardware
and an onion router
he can route encrypted data and
stay anonymous with no ip address
yeah
somebody must have
told him how to set it up
she probably called 911
whos the woman
its the manager
mrs novo
here let me see it
here try it now
barrett this is jessup
mmmhmm
thanks jessup
well we better make following
the money pay off
reyes isnt hes dead
oh great
wait a minute
weve been looking
for buyers of soy
switch to sellers
only our player would know
exactly when to get out
reyes got an email
about a drop tonight
with no reyes
we gotta find a new link
to our main player
im gonna see who shows
you tell jessup
no theyll spot
him 10 blocks away
you get into not
enough for one day
look
i play it my way
it works
it dont
at least i own it
i go too
you look not so different
from the pictures
what pictures
that my brother
sent me before
why youre in prison
hmm
i was in a bar
i met some girl
and some guy got
in my face about her
he started a fight
and when its over
hes in the hospital
and im arrested
i wound up sentenced to
18 months at mcinorfolk
i traded academia
for gladiator academy
then what
then i got out
im 22
and not a lot going
on in silicon valley
for an excon with no degree
so
carding
yeah that and
i was in wholesaling internationally
i had an eightyear run
then the feeb caught up
with me
and i got 13 years
you have regrets
regrets no
the banks got hit for
the losses not people
i didnt burn people
i dont burn people
no
i mean banks are chiseling
everybody all the time anyway
i dont feel sorry
for banks no
i mean im sorry for
what happened to you
dont be
im not fishing for sympathy here
i did the crime
im doing the time
time isnt doing me
whats that mean
i do my own time
not the institutions
see to hold on to
who you are in there
you dedicate yourself
to your program
you work out on your
body and your mind
open your eyes
whatd you say
you talk like you
are still in prison
but youre not in prison
get your thinking
to where you are
not where youve been
what do you know
about where ive been
no nothing
no nothing
but
okay tell me
what is it im supposed
to start seeing so fast
where you are
what koreatown
this restaurant this table
what
youll be in the rapid
stream of decisionmaking
having to make
intuitive choices
the people against you
are highspeed
worldclass dangers
to be genius coder
to outsmart outthink
like my brother
always said you could
you have to think
about it clear
not easy i know
theres no transition time
but i believe you
are a very strong man
very smart man
here chen
three trades
three different accounts
large volumes
they all sell within
minutes of each other
just at the soft close
at 1313 and 1314
timed perfectly
when to dump
whats that
bank accounts foreign
same place all three
where
hong kong
you want your bill
you not order more
you give up table
youre really hurting
for space huh
maybe our guy
is noshow
what is it
lets go
whats happening
who are you
why are you here
who are you
watch out
ahhh
hey hey hey
and reyes
probably was killed
the email on his
computer was bait
whoever this is wanted to see
if we were on reyes trail
were burned
could you track it
to our guys location
no the video feed went through
a proxy server in the ukraine
who knows where
it bounces to off that
yeah and our players
are foreign too
what about the money
three accounts
all in the same place
they took 74 million
were going to
follow the money
where
put my sister on
were flying
to china in the morning
my dad was a steel worker
single father
he raised us on his own
came to visit twice
then he got sick
i used to replay memories
so i could stay oriented
for when i got out
captain chen
paul wang cncert
in here
whats the status
were trying to restore
coolant by pumping in sea water
i got more injured
since it happened
was there any
demand for money
no
then its not
about extortion
is he political
a terrorist attack
any declaration
no claim no statement
what does this guy want
what did
the malware attack
programmable launch
controllers plcs
they tell the pumps
to turn on turn off
to cool the reactor
any idea where
the attack originated
i was tracking the
malware when the core went
we had to evacuate
but if a machine failed
it should have saved the
memory to a diagnostic file
yeah thats right
and in that memory dump
may be your traces of code
maybe even this
guys real ip address
but those servers are
in the control room
everything is still hot
were fighting
a meltdown
chen lien
inspector alex trang
hong kong police
hathaway
us marshal mark jessup
hello
so is this them
these the guys
yeah
we got anything
here they are
johnny li
yan lin samuel wu
li just got out of
prison two months ago
yan and his mother
are both junkies
wu runs a chop shop
hardly commodities
speculators
theyre fronts
proxies
so how do they communicate
how do they connect up
to our actor
they dont
phones
the internet
and weve been on them
all day and all night
nothing
if you were our player
right now
what would be
your next move
id make my trail go cold
how
id cash out
cash money doesnt
leave a trail
pick it up
walk it anywhere you want
but the money
hasnt moved yet
theres no activity
in the accounts
yeah
this is all too clean
i mean theres got to be
somebody between them
talking to them
instructing them
telling them what to do
there has to be
someone in contact
it wouldnt be
the main player
too much exposure
a middle man
they didnt all fall by
here by accident either
where
can i see this
right there
wheres this
yau ma tei
great
octb
were running
a surveillance
on whom
some lebanese guy on our
trafficker watch list
whyd you let him in
well they want to see if hes
talking to anybody homegrown
why here
every morning he comes
here to meet someone
run him down
hmm
elias kassar
fought with
the christian phalangists
in the civil war
then disappeared
popped up in the 90s with the
paramilitaries in colombia
renting a house
monthtomonth in shek o
whos he meet
no one
no one ever shows
he texts
is your phone an android
can i see it
trang
bluetooth transmitter
short range
we would never pick it up
see they dont
come to meet him
they come to meet this
kassar texts
wu yan and li walk by
the receivers in
their pockets pick it up
they read it delete it
kassar never meets them
never sees them
no emails
no phones no nothing
slick
can you crack it
in about a month
see its locked
in gpg encryption
so at least a 512bit key
we pick him up
lean all over him
or we let him ride and tail
him to the main player
ah you dont
have a choice
i mean this guys history
he aint gonna roll
i think we let him ride
yeah
sunrise is in two hours
when this is over
what will you do
i dont know fix tvs
garage door openers
are you still gonna like me if
im fixing garage door openers
i dont know
maybe
theyre moving the money
all three accounts
wire transfers
to a macau casino
theyre cashing out
surveillance
nobodys moved
kassar
we cant reach
yans team in shek o
were going to shek o
were going to shek o
to pick up kassar
launch stu
meet at the heliport
im going to
pick up the mules
lets talk about this
im not blind
i know the two of
you are together
but look at it through my
eyes and what do you see
hathaway been in prison
damaged goods
not much to offer
my sister
and his futures not
exactly guaranteed
is what id see
what else
she deserves better
id think if i was chen
ive rarely
seen her happier
but what if this fails
nine more years in prison
what kind of life
is that for her
chen its barrett
i hear you
the mules
weve got li and yan
and listen
we cant reach
surveillance in shek o
come on this way
trang
hold on man hold on
stay down
go go
come on
elias
elias you coming
come on come on
dont wait
drive the barge out of here
wai
its paul wang
we were able to restore the
water above the fuel rods
and stabilize the reactor
its still hot
but we can get in
nick mark
i still dont get it
whats he after
and why this
hey whatd she say
move fast
wang
wang
hey
take him
both of you
get out of here
hathaway
we were right
in the memory dump are the
fragments of the malware
but its corrupted
maybe his ip address
but its too full of holes
you know when the feeb team
busted me in 07 and hit my door
i was flushing files
but when i came to trial
they retrieved all this data that
should have been irretrievable
black widow
its nsa software
examines fragments
and reconstructs originals
within a couple of
hours of supercomputing
big cases like yours
they loan it to us
rich i need access
to black widow
sharing classified
tech with the chinese
are you kidding
thats not even getting
into hathaway using it
weve committed to
full cooperation rich
yeah well youre justice
were nsa
if i wanted to i cant
and i dont want to
an unequivocal no
okay so hows it work
you give nsa the data
they run it what
no they have
a remote login
we run it
youre not thinking
come on they got
the keys to the kingdom
our guys address maybe
whatever hes cooking up
next is right in there
only we cant read it
lets go
my old correspondence
with donahue is here
but theres no way that
login is still active
im not gonna
use that login
okay donahue
the nsa contact you
were just talking with
if nsa discovers
the intrusion
you sure you want
to do this
fbi cant explain
after the fact
you locate this guy
youre okay
you get discovered
youre dead meat
you know that
dont you
the nsa guy
you were talking to
whats his
supervisors name
ben hitchens
maybe its better
if the two of you and you
arent around for the next part
so you can deny being here
how do you feel
about this
not good
its worse for
the guy in there
im surprised
you went along
washington didnt
see chai wan
you asked him
to change his password
when he downloaded
the pdf
what he downloaded
was the keylogger
got it
now we wait
were in
you can call me
chica any time you want
this is our actors
home ip address
his home server
hes not in mumbai
not in minneapolis not in riga
he is in jakarta
can you crack the site
no
intrarmours a hosting company
like a hotel or a swiss bank
exclusively for
black hat hackers
so its bulletproof
his servers in there
but we cant crack the site
all right so the move
is strictly low tech
as in
go to jakarta
burglarize the place
get our hands
on his server
we dont have visas or badges
that work in indonesia
cant fbi
get us documented
after the nsa turndown
id stay away from dc
then ill work my side
of the house for entry
thatll take a facetoface
with my bosses
all right
all right
you getting anywhere
no
not into the servers
but i got into
lntrarmours accounting
look at this
charges to our boys account
okay so
mmm
look at this 14 17
now 16400
five times
paid to satelliteshot
satelliteshot
rents satellite time
what kind of shot
this kind
hires scan
of the coast of malaysia
whats there
nothing much
whyd he scan there
shit
this is barrett
what the hell did you
let go on there carol
pollack
do you know
what your guy did
what are you talking about
cut the crap
im talking about calls
i got from the goddamn
nsa and defense
our guy blew
a reactor at chai wan
dont you watch cnn
thats not the point
thats not the point
thats exactly the point
the guy were working
will drop the big hammer
and not think twice
about it
come on come on come on
dont evoke 911 on me
you didnt lose
anyone there stanley
look im under orders

pera limited
mining tin
tin
malaysia is one of
the biggest exporters
and theres four other tin mining
operations in the next valley
this is a riverbed
they divert water
with stasik pumps
you know why
chai wan reactor
weve been looking through the
looking glass the wrong way
he didnt target the reactor
to knock out the reactor
he targeted it to
knock out the pumps
he was rehearsing
it was a rehearsal
chai wan was a rehearsal
hes going to shut down these
pumps and flood the tin mine
and the valleys
and the villages
village people
village dogs
create a shortage in tin
tin prices will rise and shoot up
his 74 million from chicago
was to buy options on tin ore
thats what youre doing
isnt it you son of a bitch
all right
look at this
a third version
of his virus running more plcs
fiftythree
fiftythree plcs
five different tin mines
for which hes going to
