hathaway  cell search 
hands behind you 
open 16 
go  go  go 
search everything 
get off that 
hey 
take him down 
one  two  three  up 
stay strong  carnal 
this was found
in your cell 
you added  900 to all your
pals  commissary accounts
in your cell block 
is this the attack tool 
with it 
you open up a terminal
and that gives
you a command line 
that how you broke into the network
and plussed up the balances 
no 
i used it to call santa
in the north pole
and told him to do
christmas early this year 
what do we know
about this guy 
his grandfather was
a military commander
in shanghai in the  20s 
in the  30s against the
japanese through the civil war 
his father became
china s undersecretary
for trade to the un 
he came with to new york 
bronx high school
of science  mit 
his sister s a network engineer
in the private sector 
she grow up
in new york  too 
no 
he s a rising star in pla s
cyber defense section 
liaise with them 
it s inviting them
into the henhouse  carol 
stanley  we go head to head
with the chinese
on their cyber intrusion
every day of the week 
not a bad idea to be face to face
working with them  for once 
you monitor very closely what they
do and do not have access to 
okay 
okay 
send the code 
okay 
let s go somewhere we can talk 
hey  hey   
english might be better 
come on 
tomorrow  i can t 
it s impossible 
why not 
i ve got
an optical overlay network
that s got to be up
in 17 days 
they sent me
some code tonight 
the black hat who hit
the chai wan reactor 
when i looked at the
code  it was  uh   
and 
i have to have a network
engineer with me i can trust 
really trust 
like  100  
when do we leave 
the meltdown in china
and the run up in soy yesterday
was facilitated
by the same rat 
how it got loaded in
in the first place 
we don t know 
but  once inside 
it de cloaked and
became what it really is 
a remote access tool 
a rat 
the rat s job was to open a back
door in our system and call home 
the black hat then used his back
door to inject a second part 
it s payload 
that is what rode up soy 
now that we re looking at the
rat and payload closely 
we re thinking
they were   
written by different authors 
how we figured that out
was through the coding in the rat 
though several years old 
it is lean  graceful 
the payload s coding 
on the other hand 
feels frenetic  confused   
frenetic 
or overwritten 
so  the question
we re dealing with is   
is there somewhere
we can talk 
   and if it is two 
they may not be working
in close proximity 
daniels is qualified
in computer forensics 
an intern could have
written that report 
oh  really 
and who do we need 
if not daniels 
and  liaise  in  liaison
group  implies mutuality 
you don t like our boy 
what ideas are you
bringing to the dance 
a man named hathaway 
he s a convicted hacker 
serving 15 years in u s p 
canaan in waymart 
pennsylvania 
you telling me
some hacker in prison
is hitting our
financial markets 
no  but we want
hathaway on the team
so he can help out
the investigation 
he hit four
major banks 
ran up  46 million
in damages 
and that s just
what we know about 
you want the doj to do
anything other than laugh 
daniels said two authors
wrote the virus 
i don t know who
wrote the second half 
but the first half  the rat 
the remote access tool that daniels
called  lean and graceful  
one of the original authors
is me 
i co wrote it 
as a gag 
years ago at mit 
and my roommate 
the genius lead author 
nicholas hathaway 
that s right 
the hacker found the rat
online and modified it 
if we want to move
around within this code
looking for clues to
the hacker s identity 
we need it s lead architect 
the reactor in china 
i heard about 
but the spike
in soy futures   
all right 
i didn t know any of this 
we don t get a lot
of new news in here 
the us government would like
your technical advice on this 
in exchange for that 
we re going to furlough
you right out of here 
you sign that
on the last page 
and we ll get
you processed 
you ll wear
an ankle bracelet
and be accompanied
by a us marshal 
your computer access
will be restricted 
if you wanna study
the whole document 
you can go right ahead 
i can come back
in a month or two 
no  i m done 
you didn t sign it 
yeah 
why would i sign it  why 
because of the generosity
of the assistant us attorney
in granting you a furlough 
both you and
the assistant us attorney
can stick that
document up your ass 
i m sorry 
why are you sorry 
i insulted you 
what are you sorry for 
i m not sorry 
don t think you re gonna   
hey 
you wanna raise
me up out of here 
solve your trade
exchange dilemma 
and i get a furlough
for a couple of weeks 
you kidding me 
you have any idea how much
progress you re gonna make
on a strike this complex
without someone like me 
zero 
this isn t a negotiation 
i just made it one 
you want me 
you pass this upstairs 
if my assistance results
in the identification
and the apprehension
of the guy you re after 
i want you to commute
my sentence 
if i come up empty 
you toss my ass
back in the can 
those are the terms 
guard 
interview s over 
barrett  how badly
do you need this guy 
it s so good
to see you  bro 
not half as much as it
is for me to see you 
let s get out of here 
so  you planned to reunite with your
friend from the moment you landed 
it entered my mind 
you okay 
yeah  i m fine 
okay  please keep
them out of sight 
if you can help it 
see  he ripped off
and repurposed our code 
  what the hell is this 
  what 
the agreement was an approval
and a presence for
his computer access 
i approved it 
a doj approval 
now you re changing
the goalposts 
hola  chica 
you came to me 
how am i supposed
to do my work 
on an abacus
or something 
 chica  
am i hispanic 
what the hell s going on 
i advocated
getting you over here 
i pulled every string to get your
convicted felon sprung  mr  chen 
 captain  chen 
and i didn t ask 
i offered partnership 
an equivalent 
or we would do it
on our own 
well  i ll be happy
to bust him back to canaan
and put your ass on the
first plane back to china 
he apologizes 
my brother misunderstood
our arrangement 
special agent 
look around 
i have to run
the morning backup 
your network is sitting
behind deep packet inspection 
intrusion protection 
it s extensively
firewalled 
exactly 
so somebody had to physically enter
this room and plug the virus in 
we reviewed keycard
scans and surveillance tapes 
there was no
unauthorized entry 
now  we re thinking about
a routing weakness 
that s too complicated 
he wouldn t have done that 
yeah  well 
what you re proposing
didn t happen 
there s only one person who s
authorized to access these terminals 
me 
and my password
is my thumbprint 
may i 
sure 
can i have some
approval now 
all right 
this is the code for our rat 
see  it s compact 
it s slick 
under a meg 
you would never
have picked up on it 
ever leave that
usb drive on your desk 
i suppose so 
who works here
who doesn t like you 
recently hired  fired 
no 
who 
lozano 
his mother passed away 
he left two weeks ago 
john lozano 
he was only
on the job for a month 
  he have access to your office 
  yes 
i ll pull his
employment records 
everything will
come up phony 
except this 
you got his photo id 
yeah 
this section of his code
right here is a mess 
there s 25 lines 
he s left text 
it looks incomplete 
are they notes to himself 
dead end ideas 
maybe he s still writing 
yeah  that s good 
so if you ve got the ability
to move a commodity
any way you want 
what do you do 
i play it out long and low key 
i do not do one big spike 
instead  i d play it
out month after month 
less risk of detection 
yeah  right 
but our guy jacks soy
250  in a day 
mmm hmm 
it s flashy  he knows
he s gonna bring down heat 
maybe he needs cash 
fast 
he s got the money
from the soy run up 
and he s busy writing
code for what s next 
i think the real hit
is still to come 
we have lozano s photo 
what s on his neck 
kid had tattoos 
you have any
routine surveillance tapes 
right there 
face of stone 
pollack 
it s me 
can you have someone
jump on the ncic database 
search for latino males
under 30 with priors in 
i don t know 
anything like carding 
identity theft 
who were in west texas
prison gangs 
our cowboy has a tattoo
on his shoulder 
he s with los zapotecas 
i m sending you
something right now 
that s him
in the bottom left 
alonzo reyes 
did two years in
huntsville for carding 
paroled  moved back to la 
i ll have la pick him up 
he s gonna monitor
his home grid  i did 
we got a better shot getting a
first look at him ourselves 
isn t that why
you brought me here 
okay 
yeah  go ahead 
that means you and
me are on the money 
unless you think you can
do that on your own  too 
i do okay 
you do  huh 
let s see how you handle
the financial sector 
thanks  stanley 
my eye s on you 
where do you think
i m going 
this guy is one step away from
my  get out of jail free  card 
so   
how can i help 
we want to see
your trading records
of your traders who took large
profits from the soy run up 
you re requesting
i turn over records
to the fbi
and a foreign power
on thousands of private
brokers and traders 
afraid i can t possibly
accommodate you 
you re gonna protect the person
who manipulated your market 
no  you re casting
your net way too wide 
mr  chen 
you want to see my data 
you come up with something
a little more tangible 
something more in the way
of probable cause
than your hunch 
gary 
may i call you gary 
how s this for tangible 
in the next 15 seconds
i call laura greer
at the commodities
trading commission 
and i say 
 laura  how you doing 
 i d like to launch an official
investigation on one gary baker  
so the headline 
 m tech official investigated for
aiding and abetting cyber criminals 
leaks to cnn
in the next 90
so it makes the three
o clock news cycle 
as well as
the nightly news 
that d be good  too 
am i being tangible 
gary 
look around here 
but i stay here with you 
no take nothing 
hey  mi carnal 
what happened to you 
he has wrt hardware
and an onion router 
he can route encrypted data and
stay anonymous with no ip address 
yeah 
somebody must have
told him how to set it up 
she probably called 911 
who s the woman 
it s the manager 
mrs  novo 
here  let me see it 
here  try it now 
barrett  this is jessup 
mmm hmm 
thanks  jessup 
well  we better make following
the money pay off 
reyes isn t  he s dead 
oh  great 
wait a minute 
we ve been looking
for buyers of soy 
switch to sellers 
only our player would know
exactly when to get out 
reyes got an email
about a drop tonight 
with no reyes 
we gotta find a new link
to our main player 
i m gonna see who shows 
you tell jessup 
no  they ll spot
him 10 blocks away 
you get into not
enough for one day 
look 
i play it my way 
it works 
it don t 
at least i own it 
i go  too 
you look not so different
from the pictures 
what pictures 
that my brother
sent me before 
why you re in prison 
hmm 
i was in a bar 
i met some girl 
and some guy got
in my face about her 
he started a fight
and when it s over 
he s in the hospital
and i m arrested 
i wound up sentenced to
18 months at mci norfolk 
i traded academia
for gladiator academy 
then what 
then i got out 
i m 22 
and not a lot going
on in silicon valley
for an ex con with no degree 
so 
carding 
yeah  that and
i was in wholesaling internationally 
i had an eight year run 
then the feeb caught up
with me 
and i got 13 years 
you have regrets 
regrets  no 
the banks got hit for
the losses  not people 
i didn t burn people 
i don t burn people 
no 
i mean  banks are chiseling
everybody all the time  anyway 
i don t feel sorry
for banks  no 
i mean  i m sorry for
what happened to you 
don t be 
i m not fishing for sympathy  here 
i did the crime 
i m doing the time 
time isn t doing me 
what s that mean 
i do my own time 
not the institution s 
see  to hold on to
who you are in there 
you dedicate yourself
to your program 
you work out on your
body and your mind 
open your eyes 
what d you say 
you talk like you
are still in prison 
but you re not in prison 
get your thinking
to where you are 
not where you ve been 
what do you know
about where i ve been 
no  nothing 
no  nothing 
but   
okay  tell me 
what is it i m supposed
to start seeing so fast 
where you are 
what  koreatown 
  this restaurant  this table 
  what 
you ll be in the rapid
stream of decision making 
having to make
intuitive choices 
the people against you
are high speed 
world class dangers 
to be genius coder
to outsmart  out think
like my brother
always said you could 
you have to think
about it clear 
not easy  i know 
there s no transition time 
but i believe you
are a very strong man 
very smart man 
here  chen 
three trades 
three different accounts 
large volumes 
they all sell within
minutes of each other 
just at the soft close 
at 13 13 and 13 14 
timed perfectly
when to dump 
what s that 
  bank accounts  foreign 
  same place  all three 
where 
hong kong 
you want your bill 
you not order more 
you give up table 
you re really hurting
for space  huh 
maybe our guy
is no show 
what is it 
let s go 
what s happening 
who are you 
why are you here 
who are you 
watch out 
ahhh 
hey  hey  hey 
and reyes
probably was killed 
the email on his
computer was bait 
whoever this is wanted to see
if we were on reyes  trail 
we re burned 
could you track it
to our guy s location 
no  the video feed went through
a proxy server in the ukraine 
who knows where
it bounces to off that 
yeah  and our players
are foreign  too 
what about the money 
three accounts 
all in the same place 
they took  74 million 
we re going to
follow the money 
where 
put my sister on 
we re flying
to china in the morning 
  my dad was a steel worker 
  single father 
he raised us on his own 
came to visit  twice 
then he got sick 
i used to replay memories
so i could stay oriented
for when i got out 
captain chen 
paul wang  cncert 
in here 
what s the status 
we re trying to restore
coolant by pumping in sea water 
i got more injured 
since it happened 
was there any
demand for money 
no 
then it s not
about extortion 
is he political 
a terrorist attack 
any declaration 
no claim  no statement 
what does this guy want 
what did
the malware attack 
programmable launch
controllers  plcs 
they tell the pumps
to turn on  turn off 
to cool the reactor 
any idea where
the attack originated 
i was tracking the
malware when the core went 
we had to evacuate 
but if a machine failed 
it should have saved the
memory to a diagnostic file 
yeah  that s right 
and in that memory dump
may be your traces of code 
maybe even this
guy s real ip address 
but those servers are
in the control room 
everything is still hot 
we re fighting
a meltdown 
chen lien 
inspector alex trang 
hong kong police 
hathaway 
us marshal mark jessup 
hello 
so  is this them 
these the guys 
yeah 
we got anything 
here they are 
johnny li 
yan lin  samuel wu 
li just got out of
prison two months ago 
yan and his mother
are both junkies 
wu runs a chop shop 
hardly commodities
speculators 
they re fronts 
proxies 
so how do they communicate 
how do they connect up
to our actor 
they don t 
phones 
the internet 
and we ve been on them
all day and all night 
nothing 
if you were our player 
right now 
what would be
your next move 
i d make my trail go cold 
how 
i d cash out 
cash money doesn t
leave a trail 
pick it up 
walk it anywhere you want 
but the money
hasn t moved yet 
there s no activity
in the accounts 
yeah 
this is all too clean 
i mean  there s got to be
somebody between them 
talking to them 
instructing them 
telling them what to do 
there has to be
someone in contact 
it wouldn t be
the main player 
too much exposure 
a middle man 
they didn t all fall by
here by accident either 
where 
can i see this 
right there 
where s this 
yau ma tei 
great 
octb 
we re running
a surveillance 
on whom 
some lebanese guy on our
trafficker watch list 
why d you let him in 
well  they want to see if he s
talking to anybody homegrown 
why here 
every morning he comes
here to meet someone 
run him down 
hmm 
elias kassar 
fought with
the christian phalangists
in the civil war 
then disappeared 
popped up in the  90s with the
paramilitaries in colombia 
renting a house
month to month in shek o 
who s he meet 
no one 
no one ever shows 
he texts 
is your phone an android 
can i see it 
trang 
bluetooth transmitter 
short range 
we would never pick it up 
see  they don t
come to meet him 
they come to meet this 
kassar texts 
wu  yan and li walk by 
the receivers in
their pockets pick it up 
they read it  delete it 
kassar never meets them 
never sees them 
no emails 
no phones  no nothing 
slick 
can you crack it 
in about a month 
see  it s locked
in gpg encryption 
so  at least a 512 bit key 
we pick him up 
lean all over him 
or we let him ride and tail
him to the main player 
ah  you don t
have a choice 
i mean  this guy s history 
he ain t gonna roll 
i think we let him ride 
yeah 
sunrise is in two hours 
when this is over 
what will you do 
i don t know  fix tvs 
garage door openers 
are you still gonna like me if
i m fixing garage door openers 
i don t know 
maybe 
they re moving the money 
all three accounts 
wire transfers
to a macau casino 
they re cashing out 
surveillance 
nobody s moved 
kassar 
we can t reach
yan s team in shek o 
we re going to shek o 
we re going to shek o
to pick up kassar 
launch stu 
meet at the heliport 
i m going to
pick up the mules 
let s talk about this 
i m not blind 
i know the two of
you are together 
but look at it through my
eyes and what do you see 
 hathaway  been in prison 
damaged goods 
 not much to offer
my sister 
 and his future s not
exactly guaranteed  
is what i d see 
what else 
 she deserves better  
i d think  if i was chen 
i ve rarely
seen her happier 
but what if this fails 
nine more years in prison 
what kind of life
is that for her 
chen  it s barrett 
i hear you 
the mules 
we ve got li and yan 
and listen 
we can t reach
surveillance in shek o 
come on  this way 
trang 
hold on  man  hold on 
stay down 
go  go 
come on 
elias 
elias  you coming 
come on  come on 
don t wait 
drive the barge out of here 
wai 
it s paul wang 
we were able to restore the
water above the fuel rods
and stabilize the reactor 
it s still hot 
but we can get in 
nick  mark 
i still don t get it 
what s he after 
and why this 
hey  what d she say 
move fast 
wang 
  wang 
  hey 
take him 
both of you 
get out of here 
hathaway   
we were right 
in the memory dump are the
fragments of the malware 
but it s corrupted 
maybe his ip address 
but it s too full of holes 
you know  when the feeb team
busted me in  07 and hit my door 
i was flushing files 
but when i came to trial 
they retrieved all this data that
should have been irretrievable 
black widow 
it s nsa software 
examines fragments
and reconstructs originals
within a couple of
hours of supercomputing 
big cases like yours 
they loan it to us 
rich  i need access
to black widow 
sharing classified
tech with the chinese 
are you kidding 
that s not even getting
into hathaway using it 
we ve committed to
full cooperation  rich 
yeah  well  you re justice 
we re nsa 
if i wanted to  i can t 
and i don t want to 
an unequivocal  no  
okay  so how s it work 
you give nsa the data 
they run it  what 
no  they have
a remote login 
we run it 
you re not thinking 
come on  they got
the keys to the kingdom 
our guy s address  maybe 
whatever he s cooking up
next is right in there 
only  we can t read it 
let s go 
my old correspondence
with donahue is here 
but there s no way that
login is still active 
i m not gonna
use that login 
okay  donahue 
the nsa contact you
were just talking with 
if nsa discovers
the intrusion   
you sure you want
to do this 
fbi can t explain
after the fact 
you locate this guy 
you re okay 
you get discovered 
you re dead meat 
you know that 
don t you 
the nsa guy
you were talking to 
what s his
supervisor s name 
ben hitchens 
maybe it s better
if the two of you and you
aren t around for the next part
so you can deny being here 
how do you feel
about this 
not good 
it s worse for
the guy in there 
i m surprised
you went along 
washington didn t
see chai wan 
you asked him
to change his password 
when he downloaded
the pdf   
   what he downloaded
was the keylogger 
got it 
now  we wait 
we re in 
you can call me
 chica  any time you want 
this is our actor s
home ip address 
his home server 
he s not in mumbai 
not in minneapolis  not in riga 
he is in jakarta 
can you crack the site 
no 
intrarmour s a hosting company
like a hotel or a swiss bank 
exclusively for
black hat hackers 
so it s bulletproof 
his server s in there 
but we can t crack the site 
all right  so  the move
is strictly low tech 
as in   
go to jakarta 
burglarize the place 
get our hands
on his server 
we don t have visas or badges
that work in indonesia 
can t fbi
get us documented 
after the nsa turndown 
i d stay away from d c 
then i ll work my side
of the house for entry 
that ll take a face to face
with my bosses 
  all right 
  all right 
you getting anywhere 
no 
not into the servers 
but i got into
lntrarmour s accounting 
look at this 
charges to our boy s account 
okay  so 
mmm 
look at this   14   17

nsa and defense 
our guy blew
a reactor at chai wan 
don t you watch cnn 
that s not the point 
that s not the point 
that s exactly the point 
the guy we re working
will drop the big hammer
and not think twice
about it 
come on  come on  come on 
don t evoke 9 11 on me 
you didn t lose
anyone there  stanley
