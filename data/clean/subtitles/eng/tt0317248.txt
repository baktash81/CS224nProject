donan zel after becoming a widow
she started to sell drugs  
to feed her children 
she often gace out dope 
to the kids with exchange 
her favourite was
 the big guy 
she was such an amateur
that even big guy was cheating on her 
big guy was using kids
as dealers 
 my pot 
 stick it in your ass 
the best dealer  
was redhead 
may i have a sip 
big guy trusted him
and so he became a manager 
twenty for us

some day a friend of redhead appeared

big guy died in jail 
redhead took the
belongings of big guy

drug dealing is a job too 
the supplier brings the merchantise
which is packed 
all is a chain 
pot is wrapped 
coke is packed in 10s or 100s 
you can be a 
carrierist drug dealer 
the kids start as messengers 
then they do lookouts 
if the cops come
they all vanish 
then you become a dealer 
in hard times
the dealer vanishes 
growing up 
you become captain 
and if you are good in
math you become a manager 
bosses right hand 
the cops get their cut
and stay out of it 
whan ze came 
all the rivals stopped in the city 
you could go there 
bohemian people bought
their dope safely 
lots of people became addicts
and ze became rich 
 which one should i wear 
 this is cool 
if drug dealing was legal
ze would be given an oscar 
i thought that all these
are very dangerous
