donan zel after becoming a widow
she started to sell drugs

but he did not have to
big guy died in jail
redhead took the
belongings of big guy
but not the hideout
it was cursed
he gave it to his trustee
blakie
hundred fifty bags

so he took over
the local dealing
but not for long
who is it

satisfied his thirst for blood
knowing that hairy
would never forgive him
to save himself
he left the city of god
he worked all day for nickels

we are selling coke
got it
drug dealing is a job too
the supplier brings the merchantise
which is packed
all is a chain
pot is wrapped
coke is packed in 10s or 100s
you can be a
carrierist drug dealer
the kids start as messengers
then they do lookouts
if the cops come
they all vanish
then you become a dealer
in hard times
the dealer vanishes
growing up
you become captain
and if you are good in
mathyou become a manager
bosses right hand
the cops get their cut
and stay out of it
whan ze came
all the rivals stopped in the city
you could go there
bohemian people bought
their dope safely
lots of people became addicts
and ze became rich
which one should i wear
this is cool
if drug dealing was legal
ze would be given an oscar
i thought that all these
are very dangerous
however he was everywhere
if i needed pot
i had to visit redhead
