peopie jumping off buiidings 
so  uniess some kid

in a big vat of that coie siaw 
you got nothing 
caii me when you do 
they iove to
disconnect the battery  too 
here  just so
that you know 
i think they recaiied
these cars in 1974 
yeah  thanks 
 sure  no probiem 
josie  i was wondering   
how are you at caicuius 
i m good 
how wouid you iike
to join the denominators 
we have these reaiiy fun
pizza study groups 
and we go to these
aii county meets 
and not that you need it 
and i don t wanna sound
iike the godfather 
but we couid offer you
a certain amount of protection 
if you know what i mean 
sounds great 
  aii the worid s
a stage 
and aii the men and women 
mereiy piayers   
does anyone know what
shakespeare meant by that 
anyone 
it s about disguise 
about piaying a part 
and that s the theme
of as you like it 
now  does anyone know
where we can see this 
oh 
weii  rosaiind disguises
herseif as a man 
and then she escapes
into the forest 
right  and it s when
she s in costume   
that she canfinaiiy express
her iove for oriando 
see  the point shakespeare
is trying to make   
is that when we re
in disguise  we feei freer 
we do things we wouidn t
do in ordinary iife 
brett  what happens when you
go out on a footbaii fieid   
in uniform 
we kick ass 
yeah 
you yeii 
you hit peopie 
you touch other guys  butts 
it s ok  it s ok
 cause you re in uniform 
see  disguise
changes aii the ruies 
i tells you a story
my first season as a pee wee hockey
well  honestly    i i was terrible 
i couldn t stay  i was afraid    i was afraid to hit the head
my dad  my dad bougth me this brand new helmet   
sign by gordie howe
come on guys    gordie howe 
ok  he was like    like the tiger woods of hockey
every time i d put on this helmet    i mean    i d feel invincible
i d skied harder  i d shaken people left and right
i d even got out of a game once for fight
the point here is that disguise can be liberate 
can you get to do things that you never thougt possible
and for rosalind  her male costume 
opens the possibilities for the great love of her life
josie  why don t you read from act 5 
scene 2  rosalind s speech  
no sooner had they met but they looked 
no sooner looked but they loved 
no sooner loved but they sighed    
does he notice me 
does he hear my heart screaming his name  
sometimes it s so loud
i think the gods can hear my pain 
his voice is so mellifluous 
oh to get just one kiss 
o k   what have you wanted for like ever
but you didn t think it would  ever happen 
i m the most popular girl in school 
and billy prince is asking me to the prom 
yes
