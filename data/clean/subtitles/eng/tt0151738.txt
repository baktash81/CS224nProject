a certain amount of protection
if you know what i mean
sounds great
aii the worids
a stage
and aii the men and women
mereiy piayers
does anyone know what
shakespeare meant by that
anyone
its about disguise
about piaying a part
and thats the theme
of as you like it
now does anyone know
where we can see this
oh
weii rosaiind disguises
herseif as a man
and then she escapes
into the forest
right and its when
shes in costume
that she canfinaiiy express
her iove for oriando
see the point shakespeare
is trying to make
is that when were
in disguise we feei freer
we do things we wouidnt
do in ordinary iife
brett what happens when you
go out on a footbaii fieid
in uniform
we kick ass
yeah
you yeii
you hit peopie
you touch other guys butts
its ok its ok
cause youre in uniform
see disguise
changes aii the ruies
i tells you a story
my first season as a pee wee hockey
well honestly ii was terrible
i couldnt stay i was afraid i was afraid to hit the head
my dad my dad bougth me this brand new helmet
sign by gordie howe
come on guys gordie howe
ok he was like like the tiger woods of hockey
every time id put on this helmet i mean id feel invincible
id skied harder id shaken people left and right
id even got out of a game once for fight
the point here is that disguise can be liberate
can you get to do things that you never thougt possible
and for rosalind her male costume
opens the possibilities for the great love of her life
josie why dont you read from act 5
scene 2 rosalinds speech
no sooner had they met but they looked
no sooner looked but they loved
no sooner loved but they sighed
does he notice me
does he hear my heart screaming his name
sometimes its so loud
i think the gods can hear my pain
his voice is so mellifluous
oh to get just one kiss
