wow  how do you find anything
in this mess 
oh  i have a system

that s a bummer 
i m actually allergic to that 
you are not allergic to bacitracin 
you do have a mild allergy to
peanuts 
hmm  not bad 
you ve done some serious

pretty sick  huh 
wanna see how i put  em together 
hey  genius 
he invented them 
you re robert callaghan 
 stammering  like  as in 
the callaghan catmull spline 
and callaghan s  laws of robotics  
that s right 
ever think about applying here 
your age wouldn t be an issue 
oh  i don t know 
he s pretty serious about
his career in bot fighting 
well  kind of serious 
i can see why 
with your bot 
winning must come easy 
yeah  i guess 
well  if you like things easy 
then my programme isn t for you 
we push the boundaries

 crowd gasps 
man  oh 
whoa 
   things get
a little more interesting 
 crowd exclaiming 
the microbots are controlled
with this neural transmitter 
crowd  whoa 
i think what i want them to do   
 crowd exclaims 
they do it 
 gasps 
the applications for this tech
are limitless 
construction 
what used to take teams
of people working by hand
for months or years 
can now be accomplished
by one person 
 crowd exclaims 
and that s just the beginning 
how about transportation 
microbots can move
anything anywhere 
with ease 
 crowd exclaiming 
if you can think it 
the microbots can do it 
the only limit is your imagination 
 microbots

krei  yes 
with some development 
your tech could be revolutionary 
 chuckles  alistair krei 
may   9
hmm  extraordinary 
i want your microbots at krei tech 
shut up 
callaghan  mr krei is right 
your microbots are
an inspired piece of tech 
you can continue to develop them 
or you can sell them to a man
who s only guided
by his own self interest 
robert  i know how you feel about me 
but it shouldn t affect   
callaghan 
this is your decision  hiro 
but you should know
mr krei has cut corners
and ignored sound science
 to get where he is 
  sighs 
krei  that s just not true 
i wouldn t trust krei tech
with your microbots 
 or anything else 
  inhales 
hiro  i m offering you more money
than any 14 year old could imagine 
i appreciate the offer  mr krei 
but they re not for sale 
i thought you were smarter than that 
robert

millionaire weapons designer 
malcolm chazzletick 
 the annihilator  
behind the mask 
industrialist reid axworthy 
 baron von destruct  
oh  just get to the point 
don t you guys get it 
the man in the mask who attacked us
is none other than   
voila 
alistair krei 
 what 
 fred  think about it 
krei wanted your microbots 
and you said no 
but rules don t apply to a man like krei 
hiro  there s no way 
the guy is too high profile 
then who was that guy in the mask 
 stammering  i don t know 
we don t know anything about him 
baymax 
his blood type is ab negative 
cholesterol levels are   
baymax  you scanned him 
i am programmed to assess
everyone s healthcare needs 
yes   laughs 
i can use the data
from your scan to find him 
uh  you d have to scan
everyone in san fransokyo 
that might take  i don t know  forever 
no no no no l 
i just have to look for another angle 
got it 
i ll scan the whole city at the same time 
l just have to upgrade baymax s sensor 
actually  if we re gonna catch this guy 
i need to upgrade all of you 
upgrade who  now 
those who suffer a loss require support
from friends and loved ones 
 laughs  oh  okay 
i like where this is heading 
we can t go against that guy 
we re nerds 
hiro  we want to help 
but we re just us 
no 
you can be way more 
tadashi hamada was our best friend 
 we re in

can you feel it 
you guys  do you feel this 
our origin story begins 
we re gonna be superheroes 
hiro  arms up 
the neurotransmitter
must be in his mask 
we get the mask 
and he can t control the bots 
game over 
they say
 we are what we are 
but we don t have to be
i m bad behaviour
but i do it in the best way
i ll be the watcher
