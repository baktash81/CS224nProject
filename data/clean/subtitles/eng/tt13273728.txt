there s a discrepancy
in the date of the land grant 
  discrepancy 
  yes 
captain daniel mass
received a land grant
of 300 acres in november 1721 
but   
captain mass was in england
at the time 
he didn t return to the colonies
until 1723 
which means he couldn t have
helped settle the region
until two years
after he was given the land 
  shh 
   whispers  given the land 
exactly 
because he wasn t even here 
i don t know how to thank you 
taylor 
this is the last piece
of the puzzle 
now i can get back to my book 
i have to call my publisher 
 chuckles  well  i m happy
to help  dr  sadler 
digging up history 
it s what i love to do 
uh  be sure to send me a copy
when it gets finished 
excuse me 
it s like you have
a sixth sense 
 chuckles 
well  there s still some stuff
that you can t find
on the internet 
 chuckles  do you have a second
to talk  did you get my message 
yeah  i can t believe it 
why would they cut
our library s funding
like that 
the city depends on grants
to help meet our budget 
when those grants dry up 
the city has no choice 
and without that funding   
you can t afford
a research librarian on staff 
linda  i m sorry  taylor 
i m already looking
for other funding 
the second
i can bring you back  i   
we re gonna miss you so much 
  not as much as i m going to miss you  linda 
   chuckles 
 melancholic music playing 
taylor  linda promised to try
and find funding 
but that could take months 
i ve called everyone i know 
but nobody s hiring 
  craig  it s gonna be okay  sis 
  taylor  will it  that was my dream job  craig 
i know  and you were good
at it  too  okay 
but trust me  taylor 
you ll find another job
before you know it 
what do i do in the meantime 
hey  you know what 
i got a good idea 
why don t you come down here
and visit 
christine and i
have plenty of room 
you ve never seen forest ridge 
and it ll be
a really nice change
from the big city 
i mean  that does sound nice 
but i have to find another job 
well  you can keep looking
while you re down here 
and zoe will be over the moon
to spend some time
with her aunt 
oh  i do miss her 
so  what s stopping you 
 laughs  i ll think about it 
 orchestral music playing 
  ray  sorry i m late  i got up early to help my dad 
  ray  man  i still can t believe
you grew up
on a ranch in montana 
oh  come on  man  my family
in forest ridge go way back 
my great great grandfather
cleared the land for that ranch 
yeah  you told me 
him and daniel boone 
look  it s just so far away
from you busting sod
  to running a tech company in silicon valley 
   phone ringing 
  oh  my phone 
   laughs 
come on  man  you gotta love
this place  right 
every time i come here 
it s like stepping back in time 
which is why it s costing
so much money to bring it
into the 21st century 
have you taken a good look
at that electric panel 
yeah  did you talk to lyle first
  about doing the rewiring 
  yeah  about that 
your buddy s been keeping it
a bit too high 
okay  well  i m not sure
i d call him my buddy  but   
he said you two have known
each other since grade school 
  regardless  i hear he s a good electrician 
  and i m your business manager 
okay  i really appreciate
this passion project of yours 
but it s my job
to watch the bottom line 
i know  ray  it just   
it makes a lot of sense
to hire as many locals
as possible  you know 
no  not if it s gonna put us
over budget 
 sighs 
okay  all right  you re right 
  we ll get small bidders 
  oh  one last thing before i leave 
apparently  not everyone s
too thrilled about turning
the graff hotel into a luxury
tourist attraction 
 sighs  grunts 
i was worried about this 
i mean  this could be good
for the whole town 
  why would anyone wanna stop it 
  well  you can find out when you ask them
at the meeting 
  wait  what 
   sighs  one of us needs to be there 
and you re the local boy
made good 
 laughs 
sounds good  doesn t it 
i ll call you 
 music playing 
joel   sighs  hey  dad

there s a frost warning 
you better watch the roads

  i ll be fine

living in california 
  you could be out of practice driving in it 
  i ll be okay  all right 
i promise 
hey  let me ask you something

anything about this town meeting
tomorrow night 
  yeah  the one about the hotel 
  yeah  why didn t you tell me

i mean  you grew up here  joel 
you know when people got
something on their mind 
  they re not shy about speaking up 
  joel  yeah  that i do 
so  what is it exactly
on their mind 
they barely see you
around here anymore 
then one day you show up 
say you re gonna turn
one of the oldest establishments
in town
into some sort of fancy resort 
 stutters  it s not a resort 
it s a   
  it s a destination 
   cow mooing 
see  right there   destination  
   laughs

to people
if you wanna get  em onboard 
look

that the only books they read

but maybe they re right 
craig  right about what 
that  as much as i love
what i do 
libraries are obsolete 
not as long as you have anything

 chuckles 
okay   
 engine starting 
  you re looking for something

  joel  you know  i think there s an outside chance
you might   
have dropped this in the trunk 
i mean  losing my phone
twice in one day 
  that s not a good thing 
  joel  oof   
well  if it makes you feel
any better 
i once misplaced
a really  really big cow 
it was a little awkward 
but i did find her  though 
i mean  eventually 
so    i mean 
these things happen 
  that s good to know 
  joel  yeah 
  what happened to your truck 
  oh  yeah  uh   
well  i    i tend to switch
things up from time to time 
and uh    what do you think 
i don t know  you seem like
more of a truck guy to me 
  do i  hmm 
  taylor   chuckles  i mean  you did just tell me
a story about a cow 
it s a true story 
i just don t know if it ll fit
in the back of your auto 
oh  it s roomier than it looks 
   laughs 
   laughs  um  listen  i really appreciate
you calling me a tow truck 
but i cannot let you pay for it 
no  of course not 
no  absolutely not 
i wouldn t dream of it 
i mean  come on  we just met

but what i will do
is i m gonna write
my number down right here
and i m gonna give it to you 
what you do with it 
you know  that s on your
own accord  but i m hoping
maybe  just maybe 
you ll call me 
and maybe we go grab coffee 
and then    you can pay me back 
what do you say 
it s a deal 
well  all right then 
 chuckles  all right 
  until then

so  what do you think
of the place 
it really is so lovely 
  it s like stepping back in time 
  craig  yeah  it s over 100 years old 
and all things considered 
she could go for another 100 
assuming we can stop her
from getting completely gutted 
  what do you mean 
  there s some developers  and they say they can bring
more money into town
if they bring in more businesses
and tourists and stuff 
all we have to do
is turn this
into a fancy new resort 
  i mean  i like it the way it is 
  which is exactly what i plan
on telling the town council
tonight at the meeting

 overlapping chatter 
all right  everyone 
settle down 
as you all know  we re here
to take public comment
on the permit phase
of the proposed renovations
of the graff hotel 
craig harris has asked
  to get the ball rolling 
  yeah 
 applauds 
thanks  phyllis  um 
i just wanna say that  well   
i ve been working at the graff
for four years now 
i suppose that means i know it
as well as anybody 
i didn t grow up here
like a lot of you did 
when my wife christine
introduced me to her hometown 
it s safe to say
that i was smitten 
  with my wife  too   chuckles 
   crowd laughing 
since then  i ve fallen in love
with forest ridge
and everything about it 
especially the graff 
 sighs  it s part of our history
in this town 
and i think that s something
that should be preserved
and cherished  and i don t think
it should be sacrificed
for a quick profit 
  thank you 
   crowd applauds 
  phyllis  thank you  craig 
  great job 
i m gonna open the floor now 
who s next 
joel  uh  excuse me 
i d like to say something 
 crowd murmuring 
oh 
 murmuring echoes 
good evening 
ladies and gentlemen 
uh  my name is joel sheenan 
well  i m the reason
that we re all here tonight 
you see  my company 
we bought the graff hotel 
and with these permits 
we intend to make
some pretty big changes 
my family has deep 
deep roots here in forest ridge 
so i am doing this
because i love this town 
i ve seen towns like ours
grow and prosper
by attracting visitors
every year 
that s the goal 
you see  but what they realized
was that  as important
as their history is 
they can t let it
hold them back 
they need to move
into the 21st century 
they need to plan ahead
for the future  and so do we 
the plans that we have
for the graff hotel 
they re gonna be good
for this town 
that s why we need this council
to endorse these permits 
it s for us  so we can take
that next step forward
and prepare for the future 
 cause we don t want our history
to hold us back 
   crowd murmuring 
  oh  again  my name is joel sheenan 
  and i thank you for your time 
   crowd cheering  applauding 
i actually have a question 
  sure 
  isn t the graff hotel 100 years old 
so that means it s eligible
for a landmark status 
phyllis  for landmark status 
the state of montana says
we have to prove
that a significant
historical event took place
  involving the building 
  that s exactly right 
thank you  phyllis  and  uh 
according to our research 
there s no evidence of that
with the graff hotel 
  well  who did this research 
  well  i hired
some extremely reputable experts
to look into it 
you mean your company
hired people
to look up the landmark status
for a building
that you want to develop 
 scoffs 
um     clears throat 
you could put it that way  yeah 
okay  so you re saying
that if we find
a significant event
happened at the graff 
and then the hotel would be preserved 
according
to the state of montana  yes 
well  i don t know 
maybe mr  sheenan s idea
of significant is really just
in his own best interest 
oh  okay  okay  okay   chuckles 
  look  that s a little far   
  craig  uh  phyllis 
maybe we could take some time
to explore this 
uh  before the council makes
their final decision 
phyllis  all right 
this is what we ll do 
we ll take a week
to look this over 
then we ll reconvene and hear
what everyone has to say 
  any objections 
   crowd murmuring 
good  meeting adjourned 
 overlapping chatter 
joel  this is a disaster 
 gasps  you did it 
i just got the ball started 
we still gotta find some proof 
yeah  but this looks like this
is really in your wheelhouse 
what do you say 
wanna give us a hand with this 
yeah  sure 
great 
 music playing 
christine  you made
quite the impression last night 
everybody s talking about it 
i got to admit 
i was a little surprised 
the way you called out
joel sheenan like that 
yeah  well 
he threw me a curveball too 
do you remember that kind
stranger i told you about 
  wait  that was joel 
  yes  and i can t tell craig  obviously 
because he s not exactly
his favorite person right now 
  this is true 
  taylor  he seems so nice  too 
and so down to earth 
i     sighs 
i can t believe
i fell for that story
that he grew up
in forest ridge 
that wasn t a story  joel
and i went to school together 
  wait  you did 
  yeah  we did really well  too 
honor roll  valedictorian   
he never really made a big deal
out of it  though 
so none of us really knew
how well he did
until he got
a full ride to college 
okay  i don t understand 
how did he get the money
  to buy the hotel 
  after graduation  we all thought
he d move back to the ranch 
work with his dad 
but he ended up
getting recruited
  by some tech company in california 
   scoffs  another tech guy 
yeah  so he stayed there
until his stock was vested 
and that s how he got a startup
off the ground 
  he has his own company 
  yeah 
helped develop a couple apps
that got a lot of attention 
so  he seems to be doing
quite all right for himself 
okay  so this is
what i don t understand 
if he doesn t live here 
why even buy the hotel 
i ve been wondering that myself 
but i will say i m not surprised
  he stopped to help you the other day 
  what do you mean 
growing up  joel was always
the first person
to lend a helping hand
to anybody who needed it 
so maybe the hotel is his way
of giving back to the town 
no   cause why make
all these changes
  that nobody wants 
  maybe you should ask him
  the next time you see him 
  i can t  i promised craig i would help him 
and i can t do that and hang out
with joel at the same time 
besides  i need to focus 
i have to   
  i have to find a job 
  yeah  no 
we don t want anything
to distract you  ooh 
joel  hey  dad 
heading into town 
should be home for dinner 
   cow mooing in distance 
  heard the meeting last night got mighty interesting 
 chuckles nervously 
oh  yeah  news travel fast
in forest ridge 
 chuckles  social media
got nothing on us 
  what are you gonna do 
  got not much i can do
  until we get those permits 
  i m not talking about permits  son 
i m talking
about all those people
that need to know
you re acting in good faith 
i told them  dad 
i did what i could 
i m here to help 
 sighs 
the way they see it 
part of their town 
part of their history 
is changing forever 
there s no record of anything
historically significant
happening at the graff hotel 
you mean besides me
falling in love with your mother
  at our first harvest ball 
  besides that  of course 
see  that s what it s all about 
joel  things people remember 
what they wore 
the song they danced to first 
the way the lights shined
a certain way 
me   
  i ll always remember the wallpaper 
  the wallpaper 
in a hallway on the way
to the ballroom 
i remember hattie and i
were on our way in  we were   
 laughs  geez 
we were just a couple of kids 
all dressed up
for a grownup fancy ball 
i noticed the blue
in the wallpaper
matched the color of her eyes 
i knew right then and there
we were gonna be dancing
at that ball
for the rest of our lives 
you never told me this story 
oh  guess it s been
on my mind lately 
what with the ball coming up
and   
how your mother and i
never missed one 
till now 
i know 
i m sorry  dad  i miss her too 
you wanna talk
about historical significance 
you take a look
at that wallpaper 
 melancholic music playing 
quick question 
did i come on too strongly
about my preference
for charlotte instead of emily 
i    what 
no  no  no 
i mean  i get it  i get it 
i can really dig my heels in
when it comes
to the brontë sisters  oh   
you were very diplomatic 
okay  then i m stumped 
i    i am because
up until that point 
i didn t think we disagreed
about  well  anything 
of course 
up until the meeting  that is 
joel  look  when you stopped
to help me 
i thought you were just
this nice small town guy
who probably looks really cool
riding a horse 
well  to be fair  to be fair 
if you find the right horse
it s hard to look bad 
what i didn t know is that
you own your own tech company
and you drive a flashy car
and you can afford to buy
and refurbish old hotels 
okay  technically 
it s one hotel   
  that s probably not the point 
  no  no  the point is    is   
you weren t
what you said you were 
and you left out
some pretty important details 
it s just     sighs 
   the thing is 
it s like anytime i tell people
what i do or about my foundation
or i talk about my collection
of    of    of first editions
  or art or anything   
  wait  you collect books 
see  right there 
that s what i m talking about 
you see  people see me
in a completely different light
and then it    it s like
there s this enormous elephant
in the room
  and i have to work so hard to get around it
  okay  joel  wait  stop 
there s something
i haven t told you yet 
there are a lot of people
in this town
who love that old hotel 
you noticed 
one of those people
happens to be my brother 
craig harris 
you    your brother s craig 
oh   
the one i m visiting 
that s why you came to town 
okay 
so now that i know who you are
and you know who i am 
i think    i think
it s probably best
if you just send me
the tow truck bill 
then i m guessing you   
wanna pass on a cup of coffee 
i m sorry 
yeah  me too 
bye 
bye 
and redesign the main floor
to accommodate new shops
and a restaurant 
you can look at the floor plans
to see which spaces you prefer
and    oh  i ll let joel
tell you about this part 
 elevator bell dings 
  joel 
  joel  hmm 
uh  this way  my favorite part
is what they call
the grand ballroom 
oh  uh   
it s the decorating committee
for the ball  i told them
it s okay to get started 
but if you need the room   
no  please  you  um   
just go ahead 
all right  i ll tell you what 
um  in the meantime 
we can  uh  go back to my office
and let them finish up
and we ll take a look
at the plans 
how s that sound 
  uh  would you mind escorting them  ray 
  oh  yeah  sure  right this way 
 music playing 
this is gonna look great  craig 
  colors  you know  lights 
  hmm 
corn  man  it s just   
it s corn 
  i m gonna go to my meeting 
  craig  okay 
craig  i have work to do 
but i needed to tell you 
  good job 
  craig  thank you 
don t you forget it  i mean 
just  like  wow   chuckles 
see you later   chuckles  wow 
ray  right 
so i m sure you both agree
that this is an opportunity
of a lifetime 
  again  thanks for coming 
   door unlocking 
ray 
i ll call you guys next week 
 sighs 
you okay 
uh  yeah  i m fine 
what s with the sudden
fascination with wallpaper 
 chuckles  yeah  i wasn t   
  mm  fascinated 
   sighs 
listen  buddy  you gotta keep
your head in the game 
  word s getting around 
  what are you talking about 
i m talking about the fact
that the locals aren t crazy
about this project 
i m getting a few calls
from our potential
store tenants 
they wanna know if we re
still moving forward 
  of course we are 
  then we better make sure
that this doesn t steamroll
on us  uh  maybe   
you know  maybe that s not
a bad idea about you
  finding a date for the shindig 
  right   
ray  hey  lay on the charm 
do a little schmoozing 
ray  i am not taking a date
to the ball
  to make people like me 
  all i m saying is we gotta do something 
   cell phone ringing 
  hang on 
think about it 
we got a lot riding on this 
hey  okay 
 music playing 
joyce 
are you enjoying your visit
with catherine and heathcliff 
  very much   chuckles 
  i was thinking  my part time librarian
recently moved to denver 
and i ve been looking
for someone to help out
around here 
  if you re interested 
  oh  yeah   sighs 
  i mean  that would be amazing  i just    i   
   joyce sighs 
i don t know
how long i m here for 
well  while you are here 
i could sure use your help 
that s     stutters  yes 
 chuckles  i would love to 
wonderful  come by tomorrow
and we ll get you started 
  all right  thanks 
  okay 
i was wondering if you could
help me find a book 
well  you see 
i finished this one 
  again 
  jane eyre 
  that s impressive 
  and i m looking for something a little different 
and i figured  who better to ask
than a librarian 
well  i don t officially
work here yet 
   whispers  well  then we ll make it unofficial 
   chuckles 
i m looking for something
a little bit   
less dramatic
and more down to earth 
you know  with people who don t
necessarily belong together 
but they re willing
to take a chance
even if the odds
are stacked against them 
well  it might not be
a happy ending 
there s only one way
to find out 
 chuckles softly 
let me give you a tour
of the hotel tonight 
  why would you wanna do that 
  joel  because  taylor  i respect the fact
that you re standing
by your brother  i do 
but i also think that 
if you get to know me better 
that you can decide for yourself
the person that i really am 
so    a tour 
it s just a tour  not a date 
  come on 
   chuckles 
you re ridiculous  um   
yeah 
okay 
  i ll see you at seven 
  tonight 
tonight  oh  and uh   
romeo and juliet 
romeo and juliet 
so  the idea is to remodel
and refurbish 
but you can still keep the feel
of the old hotel 
if you want it to feel old 
why don t you just
  keep it the way it is 
  nah  people still want the amenities 
they just want  em wrapped
in a more nostalgic package 
  right 
   chuckles  i hear ya on the nostalgia 
  wow  this looks like it s been here a long time 
  my dad still remembers it
from the first time he brought
my mom to the ball 
they used to go 
they did 
every year 
she passed away last year 
 melancholic music playing 
  i m sorry 
  thank you 
first time he came here 
he saw that wallpaper 
the way the color
matched my mom s eyes 
he knew he would spend
the rest of his life with her 
it sounds so simple   
 chuckles 
   having two people just   
know 
i think it is 
or if it s the right two people 
come with me 
it s the best part 
 taylor chuckling 
 melodious music playing 
oh   chuckles  what s that 
oh  i thought
you might get hungry 
is this part of your tour 
  well  i can always have them take it back 
   chuckles  it s fine 
but it s still not a date 
joel  didn t say it was 
your jacket  milady 
taylor  oh  thank you 
 laughs 
  uh  thank you 
  after you 
joel  chivalry s not dead 
it s just been on vacation 
until you met me 
 chuckles 
 laughing 
craig and i grew up in seattle 
he s actually the reason
i got my first librarian job 
  joel  really 
  mm hmm 
we were in high school 
and this one summer 
our local library
was looking for a volunteer
and i wanted the job
more than anything 
so     chuckling     craig took
the bus all the way downtown
so that he could go talk
to the head librarian
and he told him that no one
loves books as much as i do
and that he would never
have even opened a book
  if it weren t for me   laughs 
   joel laughing 
taylor  he must have been
really convincing
because i got the job and   
he s been there for me
ever since 
  he sounds like a great brother 
  taylor  he is 
and very determined
once he makes his mind up
about something 
  this much i know   laughs 
   taylor laughing 
craig thinks you re doing
this whole thing for the town
as a business deal 
and what do you think 
 inhales 
i believe you wanna help
the town   
and that your intentions
are good  but   
  but 
  taylor  why the graff 
why all the extra time
and money 
isn t there something else
you can do to help the town 
growing up
my dad and i  we used to work
the ranch all the time 
you know  sometimes   
we would camp out overnight 
just the two of us 
under the stars 
and we d talk all night 
it was so special 
i used to wish
i had a magic wand   
   chuckles 
    and that i could wave it 
we should make those moments
last a little bit longer 
  you know 
  sounds wonderful 
that s how i feel
about this town   
and all the people 
that if i could just   
wave a magic wand and make
forest ridge the way it was
when i was growing up  i   
it turns out i m not a wizard 
 chuckles 
  i    i don t have a wand 
   chuckles 
things are always changing 
joel 
you re right 
and all we can do
is make sure and try
to change them for the better 
that s all i wanna do 
i wanna help my hometown grow
and keep all the things   
that make it so special 
like the harvest ball 
what are you doing 
  joel  may i 
  oh   laughs  no 
no  i m not   
i m not much of a dancer 
eh  follow my lead 
 soft song playing 
i can t believe i m doing this 
 chuckles 
it s all in the hips  baby 
  lately
i ve been running wild  
what are you talking about 
look at you 
  you re a great dancer 
   chuckles  you re a great partner 
  i m not gonna argue with that  it s true   chuckles 
   laughs 
listen  taylor 
i was wondering   
um   
you    um   
and me   
oh  my gosh  i   
 chuckles nervously 
  why do i suddenly feel like i m back in high school  uh   
   laughs 
well  from what i hear 
you were actually really cool
  in high school 
  yeah  that s debatable 
i don t know 
okay 
would you like to go
to the ball with me 
wait  seriously 
seriously 
   tense music playing 
  whoa  um   
  taylor  uh    wait  craig 
  no  i just    i  um 
  i saw the light  i thought somebody had forgotten to   
  craig 
sorry  sorry 
 groans 
you okay 
i don t know 
 tools clanking 
 bolt wrenching 
  hey 
  hey 
 sighs 
listen  craig  about tonight   
  you don t have to explain 
  i want to 
when my car broke down
in the ditch 
joel was the guy that ended up
stopping and helping me 
  yeah  i kind of put that together 
  and he was so nice
and we hit it off 
but i had no idea
how you really felt
about him until the meeting 
i know i probably should ve
told you about tonight 
but i thought maybe
if i went and talked to him 
i could change his mind 
taylor  i m not upset
that you danced with joel 
  but the way you left  i   
  i can take that place apart and put it back together again 
if joel runs through this place
with his plans 
they won t need me anymore 
you mean you won t have a job 
i didn t say it 
but it just makes sense 
once that hotel s all new
and shiny  why keep me around 
craig  i really don t think
he s like that 
he s a businessman  sooner
or later  they all do the math 
well  you heard the council 
all we have to do is find
a historically significant
thing 
  you really think that s possible 
  taylor  it s what i do 
besides  i know how much
it means to you  and i   
i promise you i will not stop
until i find something 
  did he ask you to the ball 
   tense music playing 
i haven t given him
my answer yet 
you should go 
it s a lot of fun 
you never know 
this might be the last 
joel 
you know  i know why you re here
and i completely understand 
look  craig is your brother
  and you want to help him 
  you re right  i do wanna help him 
but i also wanna go
to the harvest ball
with you 
oh  wait  wait  uh   
  you do 
   chuckles  i do  as long as you re okay with me doing
everything humanly possible
to save the graff hotel 
   horse neighing in distance 
  oh  okay 
i have to admit
this is without a doubt
the most unusual offer
i ve ever had 
so  what do you say 
is it a date 
oh  what do i say  uh   
as long as you understand   
i m not gonna go easy
just  cause it s you 
i would expect no less 
 clicks tongue 
well then  it s a date 
   chuckles 
  a darn good one 
  i look very much forward to it 
   chuckles 
the best way of digging up
the hotel s history
was from some local sources 
perhaps
a first person s account 
  much better than searching the internet  yes 
   chuckles 
and considering you know
the area so well 
  i was hoping you could point me in the right direction 
  ah 
  i may have one idea 
  taylor  great 
 switch clicks 
over the years 
the library s collected
a kind of archive
of the town s history 
newspapers  photographs 
uh  letters and diaries 
  what do you do with all these 
  well  the plan was to have it digitized
and online  but as you can see 
we haven t made much progress 
   chuckles 
  if you think it can help 
  it looks like a great place to start 
  oh  wonderful  okay 
all right 
 keyboard clacking 
 joel sniffling 
wow 
you see  i thought
i was the only
one who came in early 
yeah  well  i had some time
before the library opened 
so i figured i would help out
with the decorations 
very nice 
taylor  do you wanna help 
oh  no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
that is  uh   
  way beyond my skill set 
  taylor   chuckling  no  it s not 
come on  it s easy 
  i ll show you  sit 
   stutters 
okay 
taylor  okay 
you re gonna take one of these
and you are going to bend
the floral wire into a j 
  and then you re gonna place it right beneath there 
  joel  the    uh 
  the letter j 
  taylor   chuckling  yeah  or like a little loop 
   chuckling 
  joel  i think i might   
single handedly ruin
the entire ball 
 laughs  okay  no  let s  um   
  glue 
  taylor  let s try this one 
  here  we ll do this together 
  joel  uh   
so  we re gonna take the wire 
gonna bend it like this 
and then we re going
to weave it through 
 chuckles  hey  pay attention 
would you like to come
to the ranch tonight
and have dinner
with my dad and me 
  dinner 
  joel  yeah 
come on  he s a good cook 
and i d love to show you
around the ranch
if you re not too busy 
uh  yeah  i d love that 
 music playing 
 knocking on door 
  hey 
  ooh  brr 
that wind really cuts
through you  doesn t it 
oh  yeah  that s nothing 
around here  it s not really cold
  until your eyelashes freeze over 
   chuckles  oh  don t even joke 
  here  come on  let me take your jacket 
  oh  thank you 
   footsteps approaching 
  of course 
  taylor  welcome 
  hi  thank you so much
  for inviting me 
  my pleasure  um 
sorry to say i m gonna have
to skip dinner  though 
one of the calves
stopped taking the bottle 
i gotta get out there
and see if i can
  get her to eat something 
  no  come on  dad  you ve been outside all day  let me go 
l    let me    let me go 
let me take a shot at it 
you have a guest 
  no  i mean  this is important 
  look  i m sorry  taylor 
i think we re gonna have
to reschedule 
i mean 
this could take a while 
  well  i d love to help if i could 
  are you sure 
  you know it s gonna get a lot colder out there  right 
   chuckles 
you know  i think
my eyelashes can take it 
   chuckles  all right 
  all right  let s go 
taylor 
so  does this happen a lot 
joel   sighing 
yeah  you know  it s   
it s always something 
yeah  that s all right 
   cow mooing 
  it s too hot  it s too cold 
  river s flooding   
   calf mooing 
     river s dried up 
  taylor   laughing  sounds like a lot of fun 
oh  yeah 
it s a barrel of monkeys 
so  is that why you left 
to get away from   
i m sorry  it s probably none
of my business 
no  uh     clears throat 
it s a fair question 
if i love this place
so much  why leave it 
you know 
no matter how much
i love forest ridge 
 calf mooing 
i just had this feeling   
the things i wanted in life 
they weren t here 
does that make sense 
i didn t even know
what that was 
but i knew that   
it was out there somewhere 
and if i wanted to find it 
then i had to leave
the place i love 
so  have you found it 
what you re looking for 
not yet 
   calf mooing 
  feels like i m getting closer all the time 
 metal clanks 
all right  here 
   mooing 
  joel  come here  come on  there we go 
oh  there we go 
  good girl

  taylor  hey 
  craig  oh  hey 
   metal clanking 
   chuckles 
how old is that thing 
um  i believe

 laughs  and somehow you still
keep it up and running 
craig   chuckling 
yeah  against all odds 
  what brings you down here 
  uh  sam said you were down here 
i walked zoe over
from the library 
she s upstairs helping
with the decorating 
craig

   bolt wrenching 
good  all right 
  how goes the search 
  uh  good 
i mean  it s going 
there s still a couple days
until the meeting
and i m hoping
something turns up 
hey  um   
  sorry for getting you involved in all this 
  what do you mean 
uh  it s just    i mean   
what are we hanging on to 
you know 
a bunch of old stories
and a few fond memories  it s   
it s all right   exhales 
okay 
those are important things too 
oh  i know they are 
it s just   
 sighs 
you heard what joel said 
man  that guy can be convincing
when he really wants something 
yeah  well  so can i 
  yeah  you re telling me 
  uh  hey  what s in here 
   door locks 
  oh 
this is the old maids  quarters 
  wait  people lived at the hotel 
  oh  yeah  back in the day 
  they were on call 24 7 
   gasps 
management wanted them close 
so they put them up in here 
  do you mind if i check it out   chuckles 
  yeah  go ahead  all right 
  thank you 
  craig  uh huh 
don t get in any trouble 
 music playing 
taylor  wait  what   
 grunts 
  find anything interesting 
   dramatic music playing 
maybe 
the letters are addressed
to catherine donnelly 
care of the hotel 
this must be her 
she immigrated from dublin
and made her way
cross country to montana 
  she worked at the graff 
  sounds like she was a maid
  soon after it opened 
  what happened to her 
i don t know 
she must have moved on 
but she left these behind 
maybe we can   
  actually  joyce  do you have a magnifying glass 
  um   
  yeah  sure 
  great 
here you go 
okay  so you see that woman
on the right 
i think that s mary catherine 
but check this out 
the guy in the middle 
right in front 
who does that look like 
 serene music playing 
 chuckles 
  whoa 
  right 
oh 
  is that   
  it sure looks like him 
  joyce  oh  my gosh   
  president theodore roosevelt 
   laughing 
  oh  my   
 indistinct 
 keyboard clacking 
theodore roosevelt was president
from 1901 to 1909 
during that time  he travelled
all across the country
while he was in office 
i just can t find anything
that says he s been
in forest ridge 
well  maybe he was
just passing through 
but suppose he was here
on official business 
i think that would be a piece
of history worth saving 
along with the hotel
where it happened 
how do we find out 
well  now that we know
the timeframe 
we can just narrow down
the dates 
  okay  back to square one 
  taylor  i think it s our best shot 
  well  let s get started 
   laughs 
hey  alan 
yeah  what s going on

 laughs  sounds good 
i ll see you tonight 
see you tonight 
taylor 
thank you  that was so amazing 
learned to cook on a campfire 
it s an old
sheenan family tradition 
 chuckles  a tradition
that s been passed down
to the next generation 
ah  it s hard to tell 
he s not much
on the great outdoors
these days   chuckles 
yeah  that ought
to tell you something 
so  joel tells me
that you re going
to the harvest ball together 
i m really looking
forward to it 
i don t know if he told you 
but that ball
is another
sheenan family tradition 
never missed a one  joel too 
when he was growing up 
you should ve seen
the little tyke
in a suit and tie   chuckles 
man  i think i got pictures
around here somewhere 
no  no  you don t    she
doesn t wanna see any photos 
  no  i sure do   chuckles 
  joel  maybe later 
little fella was so shy 
he couldn t get up the courage
to ask a girl to dance 
so he would ask his mom 
  oh  god  here we go   
  which is how he learned to move around the floor
  so well 
  that s so sweet 
of course  he hasn t been back
to the ball since  uh  when 
  since you went off to college 
  uh    yeah 
guess he just hasn t met anybody
he wanted to take    until now 
  that s very subtle  dad  that s very subtle 
  hmm 
 chuckles 
which one is your mom 
uh  right there in the middle 
  she s beautiful 
  never more beautiful than at the harvest ball 
 inhales  exhales 
and that hardworking young fella
is timothy patrick sheenan 
my great grandfather 
  joel  that s the only photo we even have of him 
  joel s dad  yeah 
  where was that taken 
  right here 
you know  he built that cabin
back before montana
was even a state 
he cleared the land
for the ranch   
  got married  had a family 
  joel s dad  hmm 
and the sheenan family
has been here ever since 
 music playing 
taylor  there s something
about this photo 
joyce  what do you mean 
i don t know 
but i can t put my finger on it 
 sighs  i don t understand
why there s nothing online
about him travelling
to forest ridge 
i mean  he was the president 
shouldn t there be
some sort of record 
maybe they didn t know
he was here 
right  teddy roosevelt
just happened to slip
under the radar and come
to forest ridge  montana 
well  if anybody can get
to the bottom of this  you can 
 orchestral music playing 
 sighs 
i knew there was something
about this photo 
what 
taylor  there s two feet of snow
on the ground 
it must have been freezing 
and no one s wearing a coat 
not even roosevelt 
huh  yeah  you re right 
when i saw the snow 
i assumed it was winter 
  but look at the trees 
  they re covered with leaves 
exactly  so it must have been
taken in the spring 
that happens sometimes 
we get a freak snowstorm
  that time of year 
  so maybe roosevelt didn t know that
and he wasn t expecting snow 
but still 
there must have been a reason
he was in montana at that time 
  so  how do we find that out 
  taylor  so  my girlfriend caitlin 
she works
at the national archives in dc 
so i emailed her the photo
and she said she was going
to search the records
to see all the travelling
that the president did
during that time 
can she find out before
the town council meet 
fingers crossed  she said
she would get back to me
as soon as possible 
but i think it s looking good 
in the meantime  instead of
just sitting around and waiting 
i figured i would
come help decorate 
  what can i do 
  yeah  uh  can you help bring in the rest of the centerpieces
  from the lobby 
  taylor  of course 
ray  so every year  the locals
have this big harvest
dance thing here at the hotel 
joel 
it s actually a lot of fun 
ray 
you wanna talk about dedication 
joel here is so determined
to win over his old hometown
to make sure those permits
get approved 
he actually went out and found
himself a date for the dance 
 men laughing 
ray  it s all right 
don t get me wrong 
she seems very nice 
but this won t be just
any old date on his arm 
her brother just so happens
to be the leading opposition 
 all laugh 
so if i know
my buddy joel at all 
those permits are in the bag 
 tense music playing 
 music playing 
what a pleasant surprise 
i literally just got done
saying hello to our girl 
i decided to drive all the way
out here to tell you in person
that i m not going
to the ball with you

to win over your hometown 
  what are you talking about 
  i was there 
i heard everything

 door knocking 
  oh  hi 
  craig  hey

  yeah  you were right 
this was just another
business deal 
hmm  i didn t want to be right
this time 
what 
when joel drove you into town 
i knew how you felt about him 
and there s a part of me
that hoped that whatever it is
that you saw in him
would be who he was 
yeah 
  me too 
  craig  but look 
the council meeting s tonight 
and one way or another 
this is all gonna get settled 
and when it does  i want you

an historic landmark 
 music playing

  phyllis   chuckling  absolutely

it s the right kind of old 
it s a good old 
we have a furnace down there
  that your grandfather couldn t repair 
  phyllis  can you please   
we ve been over this  being old
doesn t qualify a building
for landmark status 
i m afraid unless
you have something new
to add  you re going to have
to yield the floor 
i am making a point 
i m    i m making   
i have several points
and i m just   
i may be able to help
with that 
joel  oh  crap 
taylor 
sorry i m late  everybody 
okay 
i think i may have found proof
that shows
that the graff hotel deserves
to be a historic landmark 
uh  do you mind if i   
  oh  please  yes 
  taylor  yeah   chuckles  it s online 
mary catherine donnelly worked
as a maid at the graff hotel
from 1900 to 1903 
we don t know much about her 
except for a few letters
that she left behind
after she moved on 
fortunately  she also left
behind some photographs 
one in particular
was very interesting 
in april 1903  mary catherine
had her photograph taken
next to president
theodore roosevelt   
   crowd murmuring 
     in front of the graff hotel 
phyllis  teddy roosevelt
was in forest ridge 
mm hmm  that spring  he was
at yellowstone national park
to lay the cornerstone
of the roosevelt arches 
which still stand
at the north entrance today 
teddy loved this part
of the west
more than anything 
so he decided to stay
and do
a little bit more exploring 
what nobody was expecting
was that it was going to be
the coldest spring on record 
a freak snowstorm rolled in 
leaving three feet of snow 
and teddy and his entire crew
stranded
just outside forest ridge 
by the time that the party
made it back into town 
they spent three nights
at the graff hotel
until the roads were clear 
  and you have proof of all this 
  i    i do  actually 
right here  i have a diary entry
from roosevelt 
he kept one most of his life 
and in april 1903  he wrote   
 snowed in at a little scrappy
town called forest ridge  
 stayed at the graff hotel  
 best three nights of sleep
in years  
but it wasn t just the graff
that inspired him 
it was    forest ridge 
it was montana  it was   
this entire part of the country
and its people and the culture
that inspired him
while he was snowed in 
so  shortly after he went back
to washington 
he decided to sign
the antiquities act 
which gave him
and all of the future presidents
the power to preserve
the beautiful country of ours
so that future generations
could enjoy
everything that he had 
by making the graff hotel
a historic landmark 
we are not only celebrating
roosevelt s legacy 
we are celebrating the spirit
that makes this city 
this country  so special 
 crowd murmuring 
  thank you 
   crowd cheering  applauding 
thank you  taylor  that was   
well  if we didn t
love our town before 
we certainly do now 
uh  now  i believe
joel sheenan would like a chance
to have his say 
 sighs 
i love this town 
i do 
it s my home 
and my family s been
a big part of forest ridge
for five generations 
five generations 
it s crazy   chuckles 
if they were here  i think
my great great grandparents 
timothy and   
mary catherine sheenan   
 dramatic music playing 
   they d be proud to support
whatever decision
this council makes 
thank you 
 applauds 
the request for building permits
has been tabled 
pending our official submission
to the state of montana
for the graff hotel
to be granted landmark status 
 all cheer  applaud 
 dramatic music playing 
  you re up early 
   horse neighing 
i think
it s about time to head back 
thank you  i still got
a business to run   chuckles 
besides  it s gonna take a while
to rework the plans
for the graff 
joel s dad  you think
the state will go along
with the town and make the hotel
an official landmark 
it s pretty hard to argue
with teddy roosevelt 
 both chuckle 
what taylor found   
about mary catherine 
your great great grandmother   
it s kinda part
of our history too 
hmm 
harvest ball s tonight 
you don t think you could hold

but it    it d be my first one
without her and   
kinda hoping you d be there

with the pitch 
i didn t realize i was coming
between you and joel 
i mean  it wasn t your fault 
joel could ve said something 
and trust me  he did   chuckles 
the moment those guys

 sighs  well

i recognized her name
from the marriage certificate 
but we never had a photo of her 
until now 
well  if i knew who she was 
i obviously would ve told you 
seeing them like that just   
well  i guess it made me wonder
what it was like for them
when they were
starting out together 
their whole lives
ahead of them   
everything brand new 
including this hotel 
i guess some things
just seem right 
well  maybe it is that simple 
what  two people just   
  suddenly they know 
   laughs 
well 
if it s the right two people 
i think so 
there you are   groans 
what are you doing out here

   soft music playing 
   overlapping chatter 
   grunts 
   laughs 
 soft ballad playing 
  in innocence  oh  our hearts
were thin  
  as the ashes
float in the sky  
  with stars they sing
and their world  
  oh  oh  oh  
who knew bad weather
could change the lives
  of so many for the better 
   chuckles 
then    and now 
  oh  love
