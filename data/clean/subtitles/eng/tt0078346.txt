of the worldwide depression
in the times of fear and confusion
the job of informing the public
was the responsibility
of the daily planet
a great metropolitan newspaper
whose reputation for clarity and truth
had become a symbol of hope
for the city of metropolis
this is no fantasy
no careless product
of wild imagination
no my good friends
these indictments
i have brought you today
the specific charges listed herein
against the individuals
their acts of treason
their ultimate aim of sedition
these are matters of undeniable fact
i ask you now to pronounce judgment
on those accused
on this
this mindless aberration
whose only means of expression
are wanton violence and destruction
on the woman ursa
whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind
have threatened even the children
of the planet krypton
finally general zod
once trusted by this council
charged with maintaining the defense
of the planet krypton itself
chief architect
of this intended revolution
and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us
with himself as absolute ruler
you have heard the evidence
the decision of the council
will now be heard
guilty
guilty
guilty
the vote must be unanimous jorel
it has therefore
now become your decision
you alone
will condemn us if you wish
and you alone
will be held responsible by me
join us
you have been known to disagree
with the council before
yours could become an important voice
in the new order
second only to my own
i offer you a chance
for greatness jorel
take it join us
you will bow down before me jorel
i swear it
no matter that it takes an eternity
you will bow down before me
both you
and then one day
your heirs
no
let us out of here
help me
forgive me
i shall return
forgive me
i shall return
you cannot ignore these facts
its suicide no its worse
its genocide
be warned jotel
the council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours
my friends you know me to be
neither rash nor impulsive
i am not given to wild
unsupported statements
and i tell you that we must
evacuate this planet immediately
it isnt that we question your data
the facts are undeniable
its your conclusions
we find unsupportable
this planet will explode
within 30 days if not sooner
i tell you krypton
is simply shifting its orbit
jorel be reasonable
my friend
l have never been otherwise
this madness is yours
this discussion is terminated
the decision of the council is final
any attempt by you to create a climate
of fear and panic among the populace
must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection
you would accuse me of insurrection
has it now become a crime
to cherish life
will you abide by the councils decision
i will remain silent
neither i nor my wife
will leave krypton
have you finished
nearly
its the only answer lara
if he remains here with us
he will die as surely as we will
but why earth jorel
theyre primitives
thousands of years behind us
he will need that advantage to survive
their atmosphere will sustain him
he will defy their gravity
he will look like one of them
he wont be one of them
no
his dense molecular structure
will make him strong
hell be odd different
hell be fast virtually invulnerable
isolated alone
he will not be alone
he will never be alone
you will travel far my little kalel
but we will never leave you
even in the face of our deaths
the richness of our lives
it will be yours
all that i have all that ive learned
everything i feel
all this and more
l bequeath you my son
you will carry me inside you
all the days of your life
you will make my strength your own
see my life through your eyes
as your life
will be seen through mine
the son becomes the father
and the father the son
this is all l
all i can send you
kalel
which einstein called
his theory of relativity
embedded in the crystals before you is
the total accumulation of all literature
and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds
spanning the 28 known galaxies
early chinese writings
point out the complex relationships
by carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power my son
chief among these powers
will be your sight
your strength your hearing
your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed
the early history of our universe was
a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war
each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through
contain their own individual law
space and time
it is forbidden for you
to interfere with human history
what was that
now wouldnt that beat all getout
will you you
pa
oh my

if somebodys doing
the things hes capable of doing
is a bird showing off when it flies
no no now you listen to me
when you first came to us
we thought people
would come take you away
because when they found out
you know the things you could do
and that worried us a lot
then a man gets older
and he thinks very differently
and things get very clear
and theres one thing i do know son
and that is you are here for a reason

do you know where youre headed
north
remember us son

my son
you do not remember me
i am jorel
im your father
by now you will have reached
your 18th year
as it is measured on earth
by that reckoning
i will have been dead
for many thousands of your years
the knowledge
that i have
matters physical and historic
lve given you fully on your voyage
to your new home
these are important matters to be sure
but still matters of mere fact
there are questions to be asked
and it is time for you to do so
here in this
this fortress of solitude
we shall try to find
the answers together
so my son
speak
who am i
your name is kaiel
you are the only survivor
of the planet krypton
even though youve been
raised as a human being
you are not one of them
you have great powers
only some of which
you have as yet discovered
come with me now my son
as we break through the bonds
of your earthly confinement
traveling through time and space
in the six known dimensions
your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men
it is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history
rather let your leadership
stir others to
in this next year we shall
examine the human heart
it is more fragile than your own
for the past two years
as we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy
well enter the realm
of the red krypton sun
source of your strength
and nourishment
cause of our eventual destruction
the planet krypton my son
your home as it was
this year we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality
and their basis in actual fact
the total accumulation of all knowledge
spanning the 28 known galaxies
is embedded in the crystals
which i have sent along with you
study them well my son
and learn from them
weve reasoned out logical judgments
by the time you return
to the confines of your galaxy
twelve of your years
will have passed
for this reason among others
i have chosen earth for you
it is now time for you
to rejoin your new world
and to serve its collective humanity
live as one of them kalel
to discover where your strength
and your power are needed
always hold in your heart
the pride of your special heritage
they can be a great people kaiel
they wish to be
they only lack the light
to show the way
for this reason above all
their capacity for good
l have sent them you
my only son

ridiculous little freak took three years
in a rocket ship to get to earth
ergo
ergo ergo 1948 three years
hes 64 you know that
do you know why the number 200
is so vitally descriptive
to both you and me
its your weight and my iq
now think people think
deductive reasoning
thats the name of the game
fragments from the planet krypton
exploded and went into outer space
it is reasonable to assume
that some of those particles of debris
drifted to earth
meteorites
voilé
voilé
voilé
a meteorite found in addis ababa
uh i know im gonna get rapped
in the mouth for this but so what
so what you mean to us
they are just meteorites
fair enough but the level
of specific radioactivity is so high
to anyone from the planet krypton
this substance is lethal
wait a minute mr luthor
you mean fire and bullets
cant hurt this guy but this stuff here
will kill him
oh
oh
yeah wow
doesnt it give you kind of a
a shudder of electricity through you
to be in the same room with me
not like the one youll get
when you try to lay that rock on him
he can see you coming from miles
with those super peepers of his
oh lord you gave them eyes
but they cannot see
nor can superman through lead
he cant see through lead
and kryptonite will destroy him
any questions class
wow
wonder what theyre wearing
in addis ababa
looks like a burnoose a wraparound
theres gold 24 karat
are we going to addis ababa
not 18 karat gold

lm a lieutenant a naval officer
shut up
route 12 is back that way
this man is a diabetic
as you know my newspaper

for this worthless piece of desert
i hope its custer
perfect
thats just what i need thank you
reporting live from the launch site

sir have you seen lois anywhere today
shes out west looking into
a land fraud deal
sent young olsen with her
on his first assignment
some unidentified clown out there
is buying up thousands of acres
of worthless desert
at incredible prices
that doesnt seem to make sense
the world doesnt make sense
you ought to know that by now
look at this dispatch
from addis ababa
people break into a museum
at night kill two people
and what do they take
a worthless piece of meteorite
how do you figure that
well
frankly ive never been able
to understand violence in any form
i know that about you kent thats one
of the reasons i wanted to talk to you
ive been in this news game 40 years
man and boy
and i got where i am
with guts compassion
elbow grease and something
youre sadly lacking in son
humility
no not humility
you got bags of humility
aggression confidence
thats the ticket
take charge let people know
who you are
this is lex luthor
only one thing with less than four legs
can hear this frequency superman you
in approximately five minutes
a poison gas pellet
containing propanelithium
compound
will be released through
the citys air ducts
effectively annihilating
half the population of metropolis
i was a reporter before
most of my friends were copy boys
i want you to do that
get lois to introduce you to superman
find out who he is whats he like
whered he get that blue suit
did he have it made
ls it silk ls it plastic
i know it all seems a bit much
but how else was i going to meet you
i knew youd never accept
an invitation to tea
but a disaster with people in danger
people who need help
well i just knew you couldnt resist
the chance to sort cf pitch in
know what i mean
its superman
look
oh my god
theres a strong streak of good
in you superman
but then nobodys perfect
almost nobody
what the
oh superman
gee
stand back please stand back
nothing to get worried about
well dont just sit there get out
i think hes coming mr luthor
hes definitely coming mr luthor
its open come in
my attorney will be in touch with you
about the damage to the door
otis take the gentlemans cape
i dont think he wants me to mr luthor
luthor wheres the gas pellet
somewhere
in the back of my mind actually
its a little idea i was toying with
is that how your warped brain gets its
kicks planning the death of innocents
no by causing the death
of innocent people
fire
navy bird we have a launch
navy missile xk 101
angle of attack is perfect
climbing fast
hydraulics general function
now as you may or may not know
i am as they say
very heavy into real estate
to make money in that game you have
to buy for a little and sell for a lot right
right
right
so the problem
how to make land more valuable
between the time you buy it
and the time you sell it
now this is california the richest
most populous state in the union
i dont need a geography lesson
from you luthor
oh yes of course youve been there
i do forget you get around dont you
where was i
california
california right the san andreas fault
maybe youve heard of it
yes its the joining of two land masses
the fault line is unstable
which is why you get earthquakes
in california
wonderful
couldnt have said it better myself
everything west of this line
is the richest real estate in the world
san diego los angeles san francisco
everything on this side is just hundreds
of miles of worthless desert land
which happens to be owned by
lex luthor incorporated
now call me foolish
call me irresponsible
it occurs to me
that a 500megaton bomb
planted at just the proper point
would
would destroy most of california
millions of innocent people would die
the west coast as we know it would
fall into the sea byebye california
hello new west coast
my west coast
costa del lex luthorville
marina del lex otisburg
otisburg
miss teschmacher
shes got her own place mr
otisburg
its a littlebitty place
otisburg
okay ill just wipe it off thats all
its a little town
youre a dreamer lex luthor
a sick twisted dreamer
your plan couldnt possibly work
ill admit there were a few problems
adjusting the trajectory of the missile
finding the optimum stress point
for the fault line itself
which by the way
is target zero right
here
ooh
whats happening lieutenant
trajectory malfunction sir
then abort
yes sir
function negative sir
cant you knock them down
absolutely impossible sir
they have the new b20 lowlevel
avoidance systems
get me the pentagon
well what do you think supe baby
interesting
your theorys quite impressive luthor
otis would you go to the viewing room
but as for the rest
its nothing but a sick fantasy
fantasy no no

its going like a bat over the
grand canyon so is the other one
the other one theres two of them

could stop them with my detonator
all right luthor where is it
wheres the detonator
you diseased maniac
did you really think you could hide it
from me by encasing it in lead
lll mold this box into your prison bars
dont touch that
i told you its kryptonite superman
a little souvenir from the old hometown
ive spared no expense
to make you feel right at home
you were great in your day superman
but it just stands to reason
when it came time
to cash in your chips
this old diseased maniac
would be your banker
mind over muscle
