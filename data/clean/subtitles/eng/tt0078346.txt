of the worldwide depression 
in the times of fear and confusion 
the job of informing the public   
   was the responsibility
of the daily planet   
   a great metropolitan newspaper 
whose reputation for clarity and truth   
   had become a symbol of hope
for the city of metropolis  
this is no fantasy   
   no careless product
of wild imagination 
no  my good friends   
these indictments
i have brought you today   
   the specific charges listed herein
against the individuals   
   their acts of treason 
their ultimate aim of sedition   
   these are matters of undeniable fact 
i ask you now to pronounce judgment   
   on those accused 
on this   
this mindless aberration 
whose only means of expression   
   are wanton violence and destruction 
on the woman  ursa   
   whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind   
   have threatened even the children
of the planet krypton 
finally  general zod 
once trusted by this council   
   charged with maintaining the defense
of the planet krypton itself 
chief architect
of this intended revolution   
   and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us   
   with himself as absolute ruler 
you have heard the evidence 
the decision of the council
will now be heard 
guilty 
guilty 
guilty 
the vote must be unanimous  jor el 
it has therefore
now become your decision 
you alone
will condemn us if you wish   
   and you alone
will be held responsible by me 
join us 
you have been known to disagree
with the council before 
yours could become an important voice
in the new order   
   second only to my own 
i offer you a chance
for greatness  jor el 
take it  join us 
you will bow down before me  jor el 
i swear it 
no matter that it takes an eternity 
you will bow down before me 
both you   
   and then one day   
   your heirs 
no 
  let us out of here 
  help me 
  forgive me 
  i shall return 
forgive me 
i shall return 
you cannot ignore these facts 
it s suicide  no  it s worse 
it s genocide 
be warned  jot el 
the council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours 
my friends  you know me to be
neither rash nor impulsive 
i am not given to wild 
unsupported statements 
and i tell you that we must
evacuate this planet immediately 
it isn t that we question your data 
the facts are undeniable 
it s your conclusions
we find unsupportable 
this planet will explode
within 30 days  if not sooner 
i tell you  krypton
is simply shifting its orbit 
jor el  be reasonable 
my friend   
   l have never been otherwise 
this madness is yours 
this discussion is terminated 
the decision of the council is final 
any attempt by you to create a climate
of fear and panic among the populace   
   must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection 
you would accuse me of insurrection 
has it now become a crime
to cherish life 
will you abide by the council s decision 
i will remain silent 
neither i  nor my wife
will leave krypton 
have you finished 
nearly 
it s the only answer  lara 
if he remains here with us
he will die as surely as we will 
but why earth  jor el 
they re primitives 
thousands of years behind us 
he will need that advantage to survive 
their atmosphere will sustain him 
he will defy their gravity 
he will look like one of them 
he won t be one of them 
no 
his dense molecular structure
will make him strong 
he ll be odd  different 
he ll be fast  virtually invulnerable 
isolated  alone 
he will not be alone 
he will never be alone 
you will travel far  my little kal el 
but we will never leave you   
   even in the face of our deaths 
the richness of our lives 
it will be yours 
all that i have  all that i ve learned 
everything i feel   
   all this and more   
   l bequeath you  my son 
you will carry me inside you
all the days of your life 
you will make my strength your own 
see my life through your eyes   
   as your life
will be seen through mine 
the son becomes the father 
and the father the son 
this is all l   
all i can send you   
   kal el 
which einstein called   
   his theory of relativity 
embedded in the crystals before you is
the total accumulation of all literature   
   and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds   
   spanning the 28 known galaxies 
early chinese writings
point out the complex relationships   
by carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power  my son   
chief among these powers
will be your sight   
   your strength  your hearing   
   your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed 
the early history of our universe was
a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war 
each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through   
   contain their own individual law 
space and time 
it is forbidden for you
to interfere with human history 
what was that 
now  wouldn t that beat all get out 
will you    you   
pa   
oh  my 
all these years 
as happy as we ve been   
   how i ve prayed the good lord   
   see fit to give us a child 
honey  will you hand me
that rag up there 
you take things easy  jonathan 
remember what doc frye said
about that heart of yours 
now  the first thing we ve got
to do when we get home is find out   
   who that boy s proper family is 
he hasn t got any 
not around here  anyway 
martha  are you thinking
what i think you re thinking 
we could say he s the child
of my cousin in north dakota 
and just now orphaned 
  oh  martha 
  jonathan  he s only a baby 
martha   
now  you saw how we found him 
martha clark kent  are you
listening to what i m saying 
jonathan

i get the football   
    l can make a touchdown  every time 
  that s for sure 
i mean  is it showing off
if somebody s doing   
   the things he s capable of doing 
is a bird showing off when it flies 
no  no  now you listen to me 
when you first came to us 
we thought people   
   would come take you away
because when they found out   
   you know  the things you could do 
and that worried us a lot 
then a man gets older 
and he thinks very differently   
   and things get very clear 
and there s one thing i do know  son   
   and that is you are here for a reason 
i don t know whose reason 
but whatever the reason   
   maybe it s because   
i don t know  it s

we both knew it   
   from the day we found you 
i talked to ben hubbard yesterday   
   and he said that he d be happy
to help out from now on 
mother   
i know  son 
i know 
do you know where you re headed 
north 
remember us  son 
always remember us 
my son   
   you do not remember me 
i am jor el 
i m your father 
by now  you will have reached
your 18th year   
   as it is measured on earth 
by that reckoning 
i will have been dead   
   for many thousands of your years 
the knowledge   
   that i have 
matters physical and historic   
   l ve given you fully on your voyage
to your new home 
these are important matters  to be sure 
but still matters of mere fact 
there are questions to be asked 
and it is time for you to do so 
here in this   
this fortress of solitude   
   we shall try to find
the answers together 
so  my son   
   speak 
who am i 
your name is kai el 
you are the only survivor
of the planet krypton 
even though you ve been
raised as a human being   
   you are not one of them 
you have great powers   
   only some of which
you have as yet discovered 
come with me now  my son   
   as we break through the bonds
of your earthly confinement 
traveling through time and space
in the six known dimensions 
your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men 
it is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history 
rather  let your leadership
stir others to 
in this next year  we shall
examine the human heart 
it is more fragile than your own 
for the past two years  
as we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy   
   we ll enter the realm
of the red krypton sun   
   source of your strength
and nourishment   
   cause of our eventual destruction 
the planet krypton  my son 
your home  as it was 
this year  we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality   
   and their basis in actual fact 
the total accumulation of all knowledge 
spanning the 28 known galaxies   
   is embedded in the crystals
which i have sent along with you 
study them well  my son   
   and learn from them 
we ve reasoned out logical judgments 
by the time you return
to the confines of your galaxy   
   twelve of your years
will have passed 
for this reason  among others 
i have chosen earth for you 
it is now time for you
to rejoin your new world   
   and to serve its collective humanity 
live as one of them  kal el   
   to discover where your strength
and your power are needed 
always hold in your heart
the pride of your special heritage 
they can be a great people  kai el 
they wish to be 
they only lack the light
to show the way 
for this reason above all 
their capacity for good   
   l have sent them you   
   my only son

   it would have been me 
otis  my robe 
right away  mr  luthor 
it all fits somehow 
his coming here to metropolis   
   and at this particular time 
there s kind of a cruel justice about it 
to commit the crime of the century   
   a man would just naturally want to
face the challenge of the century 
listen  mr  luthor  maybe this guy that
flies is just sort of passing through 
  you know 
  passing through 
not on your life  otis   
   which i would gladly sacrifice 
by the way   
   for the opportunity of destroying
everything that he represents 
and  otis  by the way  the next time
put my robe on   
   after i m out of the pool 
now look  the post   it flies  
the news   look  ma  no wires  
the times   blue bomb buzzes
metropolis

any cheap promotion schemes  mr  white

mike  what s his name 
what s he got hidden under
that cape  batteries 
why did he show up last night

i was thinking maybe we could
go for a hamburger  or   
now  then   
   given the exact location
of the galaxy that he mentions   
   and the proximity to our
own solar system   
   it s amazing 
amazing  too good to be true 
it s too good to be true 
he s 6 4   has black hair   
   blue eyes  doesn t drink 
doesn t smoke and tells the truth 
miss teschmacher  some people
read war and peace   
   and come away thinking
it s a simple adventure story 
others can read the ingredients
on a chewing gum wrapper   
   and unlock the secrets of the universe 
lex  what has chewing gum got to do
with the secrets of the universe 
right  right  miss teschmacher 
n  n  n   
m  you want m  mr  luthor 
coming right up 
so there you go  m 
m  as in  moron   otis 
no  no  no  it s n 
n  as in  neanderthal  
 nincompoop    nitwit  
  and l  as in  ladder  
  ladder  mr  luthor  coming right up 
i didn t see  because l   
i m sorry  mr  luthor  i   ooh 
in the interview  he says that
the planet krypton   
   exploded in 1948 
ridiculous little freak took three years
in a rocket ship to get to earth 
  ergo   
  ergo  ergo  1948  three years   
he s 6 4   you know that 
do you know why the number 200
is so vitally descriptive   
   to both you and me 
it s your weight and my iq 
now  think  people  think 
deductive reasoning 
that s the name of the game 
fragments from the planet krypton
exploded and went into outer space 
it is reasonable to assume
that some of those particles of debris   
   drifted to earth 
meteorites 
voilé 
voilé 
voilé 
a meteorite found in addis ababa 
uh  i know i m gonna get rapped
in the mouth for this  but so what 
so what  you mean  to us
they are just meteorites 
fair enough  but the level
of specific radioactivity is so high   
   to anyone from the planet krypton 
this substance is lethal 
wait a minute  mr  luthor 
you mean fire and bullets
can t hurt this guy  but this stuff here   
will kill him 
  oh 
  oh 
yeah  wow   
doesn t it give you kind of a   
   a shudder of electricity through you
to be in the same room with me 
not like the one you ll get
when you try to lay that rock on him 
he can see you coming from miles
with those super peepers of his 
oh  lord  you gave them eyes 
but they cannot see 
nor can superman  through lead 
he can t see through lead 
and kryptonite will destroy him 
  any questions  class 
  wow 
wonder what they re wearing
in addis ababa 
  looks like a burnoose  a wraparound 
  there s gold  24 karat   
  are we going to addis ababa 
     not 18 karat gold

we were looking for route 12 
  route 12  that s back there  isn t it 
  no  sir  it s up there 
  sergeant  we took the wrong route 
 l m a lieutenant  a naval officer 
shut up 
route 12 is back that way 
this man is a diabetic 
as you know  my newspaper 
the daily planet   
   is very interested in that darn 
but what i don t understand   
   is why you d sell out
to a person you ve never met 
i mean  you don t even
know his name  oh  yeah 
at the stupid  high price he offered   
   for this worthless piece of desert 
i hope it s custer 
perfect 
that s just what i need  thank you 
reporting live from the launch site 
ground zero 
well  today marks an historic occasion 
two xk 101 rockets
will be launched simultaneously   
   one by the army and by the navy 
hi  everybody  has anybody
seen lois around today 
no  i haven t  but the chief
wants to see you 
you re blocking the set  clark 
sorry  gil  how s judy today  okay 
good  great 
  excuse me  mr  white 
  come in  kent 
you wanted to see me 
sir  have you seen lois anywhere today 
she s out west looking into
a land fraud deal 
sent young olsen with her
on his first assignment 
some unidentified clown out there
is buying up thousands of acres   
   of worthless desert
at incredible prices 
that doesn t seem to make sense 
the world doesn t make sense 
you ought to know that by now 
look at this dispatch
from addis ababa 
people break into a museum
at night  kill two people   
   and what do they take 
a worthless piece of meteorite 
  how do you figure that 
  well   
   frankly  i ve never been able
to understand violence in any form 
i know that about you  kent  that s one
of the reasons i wanted to talk to you 
i ve been in this news game 40 years 
man and boy 
and i got where i am
with guts  compassion   
   elbow grease and something
you re sadly lacking in  son 
  humility 
  no  not humility 
you got bags of humility 
aggression  confidence 
that s the ticket 
take charge  let people know
who you are 
this is lex luthor 
only one thing with less than four legs
can hear this frequency  superman  you 
in approximately five minutes 
a poison gas pellet   
   containing propane lithium
compound   
   will be released through
the city s air ducts   
   effectively annihilating
half the population of metropolis 
i was a reporter before
most of my friends were copy boys 
i want you to do that 
get lois to introduce you to superman 
find out who he is  what s he like 
where d he get that blue suit 
did he have it made 
ls it silk  ls it plastic 
i know it all seems a bit much 
but how else was i going to meet you 
i knew you d never accept
an invitation to tea 
but a disaster  with people in danger 
people who need help   
   well  i just knew you couldn t resist
the chance to sort cf pitch in 
know what i mean 
it s superman 
  look 
  oh  my god 
there s a strong streak of good
in you  superman   
   but then  nobody s perfect 
almost nobody 
  what the   
  oh  superman 
  gee 
  stand back  please  stand back 
nothing to get worried about 
well  don t just sit there  get out 
i think he s coming  mr  luthor 
he s definitely coming  mr  luthor 
it s open  come in 
my attorney will be in touch with you
about the damage to the door 
otis  take the gentleman s cape 
  i don t think he wants me to  mr  luthor 
  luthor  where s the gas pellet 
somewhere   
   in the back of my mind  actually 
it s a little idea i was toying with 
is that how your warped brain gets its
kicks  planning the death of innocents 
no  by causing the death
of innocent people 
fire 
navy bird  we have a launch 
navy missile  xk 101 
angle of attack is perfect 
  climbing fast 
  hydraulics  general function 
now  as you may or may not know 
i am  as they say   
   very heavy into real estate 
to make money in that game  you have
to buy for a little and sell for a lot  right 
  right 
  right 
so the problem 
how to make land more valuable
between the time you buy it   
   and the time you sell it 
now  this is california  the richest 
most populous state in the union 
i don t need a geography lesson
from you  luthor 
oh  yes  of course  you ve been there 
i do forget  you get around  don t you 
  where was i 
  california 
california  right  the san andreas fault 
maybe you ve heard of it 
yes  it s the joining of two land masses 
the fault line is unstable   
   which is why you get earthquakes
in california 
wonderful 
couldn t have said it better myself 
everything west of this line
is the richest real estate in the world 
san diego  los angeles  san francisco 
everything on this side is just hundreds
of miles of worthless desert land   
   which happens to be owned by   
lex luthor  incorporated 
now  call me foolish 
call me irresponsible   
it occurs to me
that a 500 megaton bomb   
 planted at just the proper point 
would   
would destroy most of california 
millions of innocent people would die 
the west coast as we know it would  
fall into the sea  bye bye  california 
hello  new west coast 
my west coast 
costa del lex  luthorville 
marina del lex  otisburg  
  otisburg 
  miss teschmacher   
    she s got her own place  mr   
  otisburg 
 it s a little bitty place 
  otisburg 
okay  i ll just wipe it off  that s all 
it s a little town 
you re a dreamer  lex luthor 
a sick  twisted dreamer 
your plan couldn t possibly work 
i ll admit there were a few problems 
adjusting the trajectory of the missile   
   finding the optimum stress point
for the fault line itself 
which  by the way 
is target zero  right   
   here 
ooh 
  what s happening  lieutenant 
  trajectory malfunction  sir 
  then abort 
  yes  sir 
function negative  sir 
  can t you knock them down 
  absolutely impossible  sir 
they have the new b 20 low level
avoidance systems 
get me the pentagon 
well  what do you think  supe baby 
interesting 
  your theory s quite impressive  luthor 
  otis  would you go to the viewing room 
but as for the rest 
it s nothing but a sick fantasy 
fantasy  no  no 
it s history  it s happening  superman 
miss teschmacher 
  yes  lex 
  where s the rocket now 
it s going like a bat over the
grand canyon  so is the other one 
the other one  there s two of them 
yeah  superman  double jeopardy 
even you  with your great speed 
couldn t stop both of them 
while i  on the other hand 
could stop them with my detonator 
all right  luthor  where is it 
where s the detonator 
you diseased maniac 
did you really think you could hide it
from me by encasing it in lead 
 l ll mold this box into your prison bars 
  don t touch that 
i told you  it s kryptonite  superman 
a little souvenir from the old hometown 
i ve spared no expense
to make you feel right at home 
you were great in your day  superman 
but it just stands to reason   
   when it came time
to cash in your chips   
   this old  diseased maniac   
   would be your banker 
mind over muscle 
you don t even care where
the other missile s headed  do you 
certainly  i do 
i know exactly where it s headed 
hackensack  new jersey 
i have to leave you now 
no hard feelings

mine s in california

miss teschmacher 
miss teschmacher 
please  you can t

   and let innocent people 
millions of innocent people  die 
maybe

if i help you  do you promise
to save my mother first 
but lois and jimmy
