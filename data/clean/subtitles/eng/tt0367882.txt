i had no reason to believe
the mac was a spy 
he was mi 6  when i was in oss 
we did 20 30 missions together
in europe and the pacific 
don t wave your war record in our
face  colonel jones  we all served 
no kidding 
what side were you on 
i don t think you recognize the
gravity of your situation 
you aided and abetted kbg agents 
who broke into a top secret   
military installation  in the middle
of the united states of america 
my country 
what was in the steel box they took 
you tell us  you ve seen it before 
oh  you mean that air force
fiasco in 47 
i was tossed into a bus
with blacked out windows   
and 20 people  i wasn t allowed
to speak to 
hauled out in the middle of the night 
to the middle of nowhere   
on some urgent recovery project 
and shown what  pieces of wreckage   
and an intensely magnetic shroud 
covering mutilated remains 
none of us was ever given a
full picture 
we were threatened with treason 
if we ever talked about it 
so you tell me 
what was in the box 
indy    thank god 
don t you know it s dangerous 
to climb into a refrigerator 
  those things can be dead traps 
  it s good to see you too  don 
relax  boys 
i can vouch for dr  jones 
what the hell is going on  huh 
kgb on american soil 
who is that woman 
describe her 
tall  thin  mid 30 s 
carrying a sword of some kind 
a rapier  i think 
yeah  that s her 
you sure she s here 
here and gone 
who is she 
her name is irina spalko 
she s stalins  fair haired girl 
his favorite scientist   
if you can call psychic research  science 
general ross 
she s leading teams from the kremlin 
all over the world  scooping up artifacts   
she thinks might have paranormal
military applications 
general ross 
back off  paul 
not everyone in the army is a
commie and certainly not indy 
what exactly i might be accused of 
besides surviving a nuclear blast 
nothing yet 
but frankly  your association with
george mchale makes all your activities   
suspicious  including those
during the war 
are you nuts 
you have any idea  how many
medals  this son of a bitch won 
great many  i m sure 
but does he deserve them 
dr  jones  let s just say for now 
you are of interest to the bureau 
of great interest 
where you can also see scalbrade 
on the west coast of scotland 
scalbrade is from 3100 bc   
and was continuously occupied
for 600 years  until it was   
apparently abandond in 2500 bc 
there s no clear evidence  is to why   
it s occupends desited to abandon
a perfectly healthy environment   
yes 
may i have a moment  professor 
yes 
huh    open up michaelson  and
read chapter 4  when i come back   
we ll discuss the difference
between migration and exodus 
what 
you have no idea the pressure
coming from the board of regents 
the fbi showed up this morning 
ransacked your office 
searched all your files 
you re the dean of the college 
why didn t you stopped them 
  they have no right 
  they had every right 
they weren t vandals 
they were federal agents with
search warrants 
the university isn t getting itself
embroiled in that kind of controversy 
not in these charged times 
so  you re firing me 
a leave of absence  is all 
a definite leave of absence 
you are firing me 
during which they agreed to continue
to pay your full salary  until   
i don t want their money 
please  don t be foolish 
you don t know what i had to go
through  to get that for you 
you went through 
what exactly did you have
to go through  charlie 
henry   
i resigned 
where will you go 
train to new york 
overnight to london  for starts 
i might end up teaching in leipzig 
heinrich owes me a favor 
i ll wire you when i get settled 
you can send me
the rest of my things 
i suppose there s nothing
to keep you here 
i barely recognize this
country any more 
the government got us seeing
communists in our soup 
when hysteria reaches academics 
then it s time to call in that career 
how did deirdre take the news 
how does any wife take
such things   
the look on her face  was a
combination of pride and panic 
i never should have doubted
you  my friend 
well  you have reason to question
your friends these days 
a brutal couple a years 
huh    charlie 
first dad  then marcus 
it seems we ve reached the age
where lives stops giving us things   
and starts taking them away 
just another half glass 
hey 
hey  old man 
professor    hello 
  hey  you dr  jones 
  you re running out of platform  kid 
  are you a friend of dr  oxley 
  harold oxley  the archaeologist 
  yeah 
  what about him 
they re gonna kill m 
i haven t talked to
harold oxley in 20 years 
  he s a brilliant guy 
  uh hm 
he puts you to sleep  just by talking 
yeah  when i was a kid 
that s how i went to sleep 
oxleys  voice was better 
than a glass of warm milk 
my name is mutt    mutt williams 
  mutt 
  yeah 
what kind of name is that 
this is what i have chosen 
is this a problem here 
take it easy 
what was your relationship with oxley 
my dad died in the war 
ox kind a helped my mom 
raise me 
you re saying  somebody s
gonna kill him 
six months ago  my mom
gets a letter from the ox 
he s down in peru 
he found some kind of skull 
a crystal skull 
the one that this guy mitchell hodgkins 
hedgkins  the one he found 
ox and i were obsessed with the
mitchell hedges skull in college 
how do you know about it 
are you kidding 
that s all he talked about  he talked about
that thing  till the cows came home 
what is it  some kind of idle 
a carving meso american 
there re a number of crystal skulls in the
world  i saw one in a british museum 
interesting crafts man ship 
but    that s about it 
well  go laugh if you want   
ox said  he found it this time 
he said this one s real and he s off
to a place called akator with it 
akator 
  he said that 
  yeah 
  you sure 
  that s what he said   
he said akator  what is it 
it is a mythical  lost city 
in the amazon 
conquistedores  called it  el dorado  
supposedly the puga tribe were
chosen by their god 7000 years ago   
to build a giant city  out of solid gold 
with aqueducts  paved roads  technology
that wouldn t be seen again  for 5000 years 
francisco de arellano disappeared in
the amazon  looking for it in 1546 
i almost died of typhus 
looking for it myself 
  i don t think it exists 
  why would ox wanna take the skull there 
well  legend says  that a crystal skull was
stolen from akator in the 15 or 16 century 
and that whoever returns
the skull to the city temple   
we ll be given control over it s power 
power  right  so  there is
some kind of power 
what s the power 
i don t know  kid 
it s just a story 
with those letters my mom thought  the ox
was off his rocker  he has smog in the noggin   
so she goes down there to find him   
but he s already been kidnapped 
now they got her too 
now ox said  he hid
that skull some place   
now if my mom don t come up
with it  they would kill m both 
now she said  you d help me 
  me  what s your moms  name again 
  mary 
  mary williams  remember her 
  i met a lot a mary s  kid

alright  it s my mother 
you don t have to get sore all the time 
just to proof how tough you are 
sit down  please sit down 
it s gonna be fun 
to find the skull with you 
i think you re some type    like a   
grave robber or something 
i m a 10 year professor of archaeology 
oh   you re a teacher 
well  that s gonna be a big help 
anyway  she called me 2 weeks
ago  from south america   
she said she d escaped 
but they were after her 
she said she just gotten
a letter from the ox   
and mailed it to me 
so i can give it to you 
then the line went dead 
i opened it  i mean    it s
pointless though   
it s gibberish  it s not
even english lettering

wait   
go 
damn 
don t let m get away  hurry 
move this thing 
move 
move 
this is crazy 
somebody s gonna get hurt 
step on the damn brakes 
turn here  go left 
back  turn around 
  spread  spread  spread  spread 
  you re going to fast 
that s a matter of opinion 
  excuse me  dr  jones 
  yes 
um    i just had a question on
hargroves  enormative culture model 
forget hargrove   
read vere gordon child 
under divisionism 
he spent most of his life in the field 
if you want to be
a good archaeologist   
you gotta get out of the library 
  who is that 
  francisco de orellana  the conquistador 
remember the guy that got lost 
looking for the skull  and   
just as i thought   
quioma 
  what s that 
  it s an extinct latin american language 
pre colombian syllabic based and   
you see  the diagonastic frames on
the ideogram  it s defently quioma 
you speak it 
nobody speaks it  it hasn t been
heard a live in 3000 years 
i might be able to read it  if i
walk it through the mayan first 
you know  for an old man 
you ain t bad in a fight 
that means a lot 
what  you re like 80 
it s a riddle 
leave it to ox  to write a riddle
in a death language 
follow the lines in the earth 
only gods can read   
which lead to orellanas  cradle   
guarded by the living dead 
he s talking about nazca lines 
  what are those 
  well   
geoglifos 
giant  ancient drawings 
carved in the desert floor in peru 
from the ground 
they don t look like anything   
but from the sky   
only the gods can read them   
because only gods  live up there 
oxley s telling us   
the skull is in nazca peru 
finally 
they saw him 
ox wandered in to town 
a couple of months ago 
he acted like a mad man  the police
locked him up in a sanitarium  this way 
i speak spanish  but i don t understand
a word of that  what was it 
quechua  a local inca dialect 
where d you learn that one 
  long story 
  i got time 
i lived with pancho villa  a
couple of his guys spoke it 
bull shit 
  you asked 
  pancho villa 
technically  i was kidnapped 
by pancho villa 
it was a fight against victoriano huerta 
  how old were you 
  about your age 
your parents must have had
a      huh 
it worked out  things were
a little tense at home 
yeah  me and my mom  aren t
on the best of terms either 
treat her right  kid 
you only got one 
sometimes  not for that long 
well  it s not my fault  it s her  she got
peed  because i quit school  she thinks   
  i m some kind of goof or something 
  you quit school 
oh yeah  shit  tons of them 
fancy prep schools  teach you
how to debate  chess  fencing   
i m great with a blade  i just
think it is a waste of time 
  you never finished 
  no  it s just a bunch of useless skills   
dull books  i love reading  you know 
i used to read all the time  but now   
  i can think of my myself  you get me 
  what d you do for money 
  fix motorcycles 
  can you do that  for rest of your live 
maybe i will 
you see a problem with that 
no  not if that s what you love doing 
don t let anybody tell you different 
this is it 
sister 
she says ox isn t here 
she don t know where he is 
some men came
and took him away 
men with guns 
she says he was upset  deranged  drew
pictures all over the walls of his cell 
this riddle in ox s letter 
doesn t make any sense 
follow the lines that only
the gods can read   
that leads to orellanas  cradle 
cradle  birth 
orellana wasn t born in peru 
he was born in spain 
he was a conquistador 
he came here for gold 
  what happened to him 
  he disappeared along with six others   
their bodies were never found 
he must ve lost the mind 
ox  i wonder what happened 
what happened 
this is not the
mitchell hedges skull 
look at the elongated cranium 
and the same word 
in different languages   
over and over again 
returno 
  voltar 
  retorno 
return  return where 
or return what 
you mean the skull 
it seems to have been
on his mind 
where we re suppose
to return it too 
sweep here 
ox didn t mean orellanas
birth place   
the cradle has another meaning
in mayan 
literally  it means  resting place  
as in the  final resting place  
ox made orellanas grave  with   
these drawings scratched on the floor 
it s the cemetery  where he s buried 
you said orellana vanished and
nobody ever found his grave 
well  it looks like harold oxley did 
grave robbers will be shot 
good thing  we re not grave robbers 
what re we looking for 
i don t know yet 
maybe an anti chamber
off one of those barrows 
i think i just saw something 
ahh   you re jumping at shadows 
this way down 
this way up 
those darts are poisoned 
stay there 
you re    a teacher 
part time 
dead end 
maybe 
what re you doing  put that thing away 
give me some light over here 
bring it over here 
it s just a thing 
dance on your on time  will you 
well  a scorpion just stung me 
am i gonna die 
  how big 
  huge 
  good 
  good 
when it comes to scorpions 
the bigger the better 
a small one bites you 
don t keep it to yourself 
these skulls 
look at those skulls  man 
like the drawings in oxleys  cell 
it means we re getting closer 
that s great 
why is it like that 
nazca indians used to burn their
infants heads with rope   
to elongate the skull like that 
  why 
  honor their gods 
no  no  god s head is not like that 
it depends on who your god is 
are you going nowhere fast 
professor  this really
is a dead end  look 
hey 
come on  genius   
bring your back pack 
this is incredible 
un real 
don t touch anything 
foot prints   
somebody s been here 
recently   
two sets of prints 
same size  could have been
the same person twice 
not bad  kid 
one 
two 
three 
four 
five 
six 
seven 
orellana and his men  might have
made it out of the jungle  after all 
give me some light 
you don t have a knife  do you 
  this one just died yesterday 
  it s the wrappings  that preserved him 
  what just happened 
  he s been wrapped up for 500 years 
air doesn t agree with him 
thanks 
i don t wanna keep
borrowing yours all the time 
  that s fine 
  i just gonna put it back 
was this one open already 
it s him 
it s orellana himself 
they called him  the bullion man  
his lust for gold was legendary 
it s odd   
somebody has been here
and gone 
they left all this   
gold 
and all the artifacts 
what were they looking for 
hold this 
oh my   
un    believable 
no tool marks 
a single piece of seamless quartz 
right across the brain 
it s not possible  even with todays
technology  which are    huh   
  crystal is not magnetic 
  neither is gold 
what s is this thing 
maybe the nazca indians
thought  this was their god 
  you think this is the one from   
  akator 
maybe the spaniards found the skull 
and along with this other loot   
they re headed for their
ships along the shore 
maybe the indians caught
up with them  while   
they got to squabbling amongst
themselves  over their prize   
killed each other off  the indians
wrapped them up and buried them 
a couple a 100 years later 
oxley shows up here   
finds the skull 
takes it away 
maybe to akator 
  but then he returns it    here 
  return 
return  what he wrote
on the walls of his cell 
he put it back 
where he had found it 
why 
hello  jonesy 
hello  mac 
you re lucky i turned up  jonesy 
good thing  cause they were
gonna blow your brains out 
that s the  huh    third time
i saved your life 
unshackle me 
i ll give you a big hug 
you had a lugger   
pointing at the place of your
skull  first time we met 
i had the situation under control 
  you owe me 
  what d you owe them  huh 
after the war  when you turned   
how many names 
did you give the reds 
how many good men died 
because of you 
eventually  they re gonna let
me out of this chair  comrade 
and when they do   
i m gonna break your nose 
comrade 
you think this is about flags 
about you  do you think this
is about lines on a map 
it s about money  isn t it 
oh    not only money 
a gigantic pile of money 
don t worry about what
the russians will pay 
it s nothing compared 
to what s at akator 
an entire city of gold 
it s what the conquistadors were after 
for god s sake  jonesy 
we ll be rich 
richer than howard hughes 
blood money  every nickel 
i need you to see the
angle here  mate 
be smart  do the right thing 
just like in   
like in berlin  you know  mate 
just like in berlin 
you want me to trot off  or    huh 
should we sing a song 
how fortunate of our failure
to kill you  dr  jones 
you survived  to be of
service to us  once again 
well  you know me 
always glad to help 
 now i ve become death    
 the destroyer of worlds  
you recognize those words 
that was your own dr  oppenheimer 
after he created the atomic bomb 
  he was quoting the hindu bible 
  it was nuclear intimidation 
but now the next level of
weaponry  is ours to have 
  yours to fear 
  weapon  what weapon 
a mind weapons 
a new frontier of psychic warfare 
that was stalin s dream 
now  i know why oxley  put the
skull back where he found it 
  he knew  you were looking for it 
  the skull is no mere devinity carving 
surely you knew that  as soon
as you laid eyes on it 
  it was not made by human hands 
  who made it then 
come on   
the body we found in
new mexico was not the first 
we already dissected 2 others  from
similar crash sites in soviet union 
saucer men from mars 
the legends about akator 
are all true 
early man could not have
conceived it  much less built it 
it was a city  of superior beings 
with technology and
paranormal abilities 
you gotta be kidding me 
maybe you choose one 
to believe your own eyes 
the new mexico specimen 
gave us hope 
unlike the others we found 
this skeleton was pure crystal 
a distant cousin perhaps   
maybe that too 
was sent to find akator 
perhaps  we re all searching
for the same thing 
there is no other explanation 
there s always another explanation 
the skull was stolen from
akator in the 15th century 
  whoever returns   
  returns it to the city temple   
will gain control over it s powers 
i heard that bedtime story before 
it s a legend  why do you
think akator even existed 
you should ask your
friend that question 
  bring in the professor 
  we re certain  he s been there 
oxley 
  hey 
  aren t you coming 
ox  it s me  indy 
ox 
you re faking it  right 
 through eyes at last
i saw in tears  
ox  listen to me  pal 
your name is harold oxley 
you were born in leeds  england 
you and i went to school togather 
at the university of chicago 
and you are never this interesting 
my name is indi   
my name is henry jones  jr 
what have you done to him 
we ain t done a thing 
it s probably the skull 
he is the divining role 
that will lead us to akator 
but we need some one
to interpret him for us 
his mind it seams is quite weak   
let s hope yours is stronger 
the skull crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain   
opening the psychic channel 
oxley lost control of his mind 
by staring to long into it s eyes 
we believe  you can
get through to him   
after you have done the same 
i got a better idea  you look at it 
the skull does not speak
to everyone  it seams 
surely you re not afraid  dr  jones 
you spent your entire life 
looking for answers 
think of the truth  behind those eyes 
there maybe hundreds
of skulls at akator

power over the mind of men 
be carefull  you might get
exactly what you wished for

imagine   
to peer across the world and
know the enemy s secrets 
to place all our thoughts 
into the minds of your leaders  
make your teachers  teach the
true version of the history 
make your soldiers attack 
on our command 
we ll be everywhere  at once 
more powerfull than a whisper 
invading your dreams  thinking your
thoughts for you  while you sleep 
we will change you  dr  jones 
always  from the inside 
we will turn you  into us
