we did 2030 missions together
in europe and the pacific
dont wave your warrecord in our
face colonel jones we all served
no kidding
what side were you on
i dont think you recognize the
gravity of your situation
you aided and abetted kbg agents
who broke into a topsecret
military installation in the middle
of the united states of america
my country
what was in the steelbox they took
you tell us youve seen it before
oh you mean that airforce
fiasco in 47
i was tossed into a bus
with blackedout windows
and 20 people i wasnt allowed
to speak to
hauled out in the middle of the night
to the middle of nowhere
on some urgent recovery project
and shown what pieces of wreckage
and an intensely magnetic shroud
covering mutilated remains
none of us was ever given a
full picture
we were threatened with treason
if we ever talked about it
so you tell me
what was in the box
indy thank god
dont you know its dangerous
to climb into a refrigerator
those things can be deadtraps
its good to see you too don
relax boys
i can vouch for dr jones
what the hell is going on huh
kgb on american soil
who is that woman
describe her
tall thin mid 30s
carrying a sword of some kind
a rapier i think
yeah thats her
you sure shes here
here and gone
who is she
her name is irina spalko
shes stalins fairhaired girl
his favorite scientist
if you can call psychic research science
general ross
shes leading teams from the kremlin
all over the world scooping up artifacts
she thinks might have paranormal
military applications
general ross
back off paul
not everyone in the army is a
commie and certainly not indy
what exactly i might be accused of
besides surviving a nuclear blast
nothing yet
but frankly your association with
george mchale makes all your activities
suspicious including those
during the war
are you nuts
you have any idea how many
medals this son of a bitch won
great many im sure
but does he deserve them
dr jones lets just say for now
you are of interest to the bureau
of great interest
where you can also see scalbrade
on the westcoast of scotland
scalbrade is from 3100 bc
and was continuously occupied
for 600 years until it was
apparently abandond in 2500 bc
theres no clear evidence is to why
its occupends desited to abandon
a perfectly healthy environment
yes
may i have a moment professor
yes
huh open up michaelson and
read chapter 4 when i come back
well discuss the difference
between migration and exodus
what
you have no idea the pressure
coming from the board of regents
the fbi showed up this morning
ransacked your office
searched all your files
youre the dean of the college
why didnt you stopped them
they have no right
they had every right
they werent vandals
they were federalagents with
search warrants
the university isnt getting itself
embroiled in that kind of controversy
not in these charged times
so youre firing me
a leave of absence is all
a definite leave of absence
you are firing me
during which they agreed to continue
to pay your full salary until
i dont want their money
please dont be foolish
you dont know what i had to go
through to get that for you
you went through
what exactly did you have
to go through charlie
henry
i resigned
where will you go
train to new york
overnight to london for starts
i might end up teaching in leipzig
heinrich owes me a favor
ill wire you when i get settled
you can send me
the rest of my things
i suppose theres nothing
to keep you here
i barely recognize this
country any more
the government got us seeing
communists in our soup
when hysteria reaches academics
then its time to call in that career
how did deirdre take the news
how does any wife take
such things
the look on her face was a
combination of pride and panic
i never should have doubted
you my friend
well you have reason to question
your friends these days
a brutal couplea years
huh charlie
first dad then marcus
it seems weve reached the age
where lives stops giving us things
and starts taking them away
just another half glass
hey
hey old man
professor hello
hey you dr jones
youre running out of platform kid
are you a friend of dr oxley
harold oxley the archaeologist
yeah
what about him
theyre gonna killm
i havent talked to
harold oxley in 20 years
hes a brilliant guy
uhhm
he puts you to sleep just by talking
yeah when i was a kid
thats how i went to sleep
oxleys voice was better
than a glass of warm milk
my name is mutt mutt williams
mutt
yeah
what kind of name is that
this is what i have chosen
is this a problem here
take it easy
what was your relationship with oxley
my dad died in the war
ox kinda helped my mom
raise me
youre saying somebodys
gonna kill him
six months ago my mom
gets a letter from the ox
hes down in peru
he found some kind of skull
a crystal skull
the one that this guy mitchell hodgkins
hedgkins the one he found
ox and i were obsessed with the
mitchell hedges skull in college
how do you know about it
are you kidding
thats all he talked about he talked about
that thing till the cows came home
what is it some kind of idle
a carving mesoamerican
therere a number of crystal skulls in the
world i saw one in a british museum
interesting craftsmanship
but thats about it
well go laugh if you want
ox said he found it this time
he said this ones real and hes off
to a place called akator with it
akator
he said that
yeah
you sure
thats what he said
he said akator what is it
it is a mythical lost city
in the amazon
conquistedores called it el dorado
supposedly the pugatribe were
chosen by their god 7000 years ago
to build a giant city out of solid gold
with aqueducts paved roads technology
that wouldnt be seen again for 5000 years
francisco de arellano disappeared in
the amazon looking for it in 1546
i almost died of typhus
looking for it myself
i dont think it exists
why would ox wanna take the skull there
well legend says that a crystal skull was
stolen from akator in the 15 or 16 century
and that whoever returns
the skull to the city temple
well be given control over its power
power right so there is
some kind of power
whats the power
i dont know kid
its just a story
with those letters my mom thought the ox
was off his rocker he has smog in the noggin
so she goes down there to find him
but hes already been kidnapped
now they got her too
now ox said he hid
that skull some place
now if my mom dont come up
with it they would killm both
now she said youd help me
me whats your moms name again
mary
mary williams remember her
i met a lota marys kid
shut up thats my mother
youre talking about
alright its my mother
you dont have to get sore all the time
just to proof how tough you are
sit down please sit down
its gonna be fun
to find the skull with you
i think youre some type like a
graverobber or something
im a 10 year professor of archaeology
oh youre a teacher
well thats gonna be a big help
anyway she called me 2 weeks
ago from south america
she said shed escaped
but they were after her
she said she just gotten
a letter from the ox
and mailed it to me
so i can give it to you
then the line went dead
i opened it i mean its

somebodys gonna get hurt
step on the damn brakes
turn here go left
back turn around
spread spread spread spread
youre going to fast
thats a matter of opinion
excuse me dr jones
yes
um i just had a question on
hargroves enormative culture model
forget hargrove
read vere gordon child
under divisionism
he spent most of his life in the field
if you want to be
a good archaeologist
you gotta get out of the library
who is that
francisco de orellana the conquistador
remember the guy that got lost
looking for the skull and
just as i thought
quioma
whats that
its an extinct latin american language
pre colombian syllabic based and
you see the diagonastic frames on
the ideogram its defently quioma
you speak it
nobody speaks it it hasnt been
heard a live in 3000 years
i might be able to read it if i
walk it through the mayan first
you know for an old man
you aint bad in a fight
that means a lot
what youre like 80
its a riddle
leave it to ox to write a riddle
in a death language
follow the lines in the earth
only gods can read
which lead to orellanas cradle
guarded by the living dead
hes talking about nazca lines
what are those
well
geoglifos
giant ancient drawings
carved in the desert floor in peru
from the ground
they dont look like anything
but from the sky
only the gods can read them
because only gods live up there
oxleys telling us
the skull is in nazca peru
finally
they saw him
ox wandered in to town
a couple of months ago
he acted like a madman the police
locked him up in a sanitarium this way
i speak spanish but i dont understand
a word of that what was it
quechua a local inca dialect
whered you learn that one
long story
i got time
i lived with pancho villa a
couple of his guys spoke it
bullshit
you asked
pancho villa
technically i was kidnapped
by pancho villa
it was a fight against victoriano huerta
how old were you
about your age
your parents must have had
a  huh
it worked out things were
a little tense at home
yeah me and my mom arent
on the best of terms either
treat her right kid
you only got one
sometimes not for that long
well its not my fault its her she got
peed because i quit school she thinks
im some kind of goof or something
you quit school
oh yeah shit tons of them
fancy prepschools teach you
how to debate chess fencing
im great with a blade i just
think it is a waste of time
you never finished
no its just a bunch of useless skills
dull books i love reading you know
i used to read all the time but now
i can think of my myself you get me
whatd you do for money
fix motorcycles
can you do that for rest of your live
maybe i will
you see a problem with that
no not if thats what you love doing
dont let anybody tell you different
this is it
sister
she says ox isnt here
she dont know where he is
some men came
and took him away
men with guns
she says he was upset deranged drew
pictures all over the walls of his cell
this riddle in oxs letter
doesnt make any sense
follow the lines that only
the gods can read
that leads to orellanas cradle
cradle birth
orellana wasnt born in peru
he was born in spain
he was a conquistador
he came here for gold
what happened to him
he disappeared along with six others
their bodies were never found
he mustve lost the mind
ox i wonder what happened
what happened
this is not the
mitchellhedges skull
look at the elongated cranium
and the same word
in different languages
over and over again
returno
voltar
retorno
return return where
or return what
you mean the skull
it seems to have been
on his mind
where were suppose
to return it too
sweep here
ox didnt mean orellanas
birth place
the cradle has another meaning
in mayan
literally it means resting place
as in the final resting place
ox made orellanas grave with
these drawings scratched on the floor
its the cemetery where hes buried
you said orellana vanished and
nobody ever found his grave
well it looks like harold oxley did
graverobbers will be shot
good thing were not graverobbers
whatre we looking for
i dont know yet
maybe an antichamber
off one of those barrows
i think i just saw something
ahh youre jumping at shadows
this way down
this way up
those darts are poisoned
stay there
youre a teacher
part time
dead end
maybe
whatre you doing put that thing away
give me some light over here
bring it over here
its just a thing
dance on your on time will you
well a scorpion just stung me
am i gonna die
how big
huge
good
good
when it comes to scorpions
the bigger the better
a small one bites you
dont keep it to yourself
these skulls
look at those skulls man
like the drawings in oxleys cell
it means were getting closer
thats great
why is it like that
nazca indians used to burn their
infants heads with rope
to elongate the skull like that
why
honor their gods
no no gods head is not like that
it depends on who your god is
are you going nowhere fast
professor this really
is a deadend look
hey
come on genius
bring your backpack
this is incredible
unreal
dont touch anything
footprints
somebodys been here
recently
two sets of prints
same size could have been
the same person twice
not bad kid
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
orellana and his men might have
made it out of the jungle after all
give me some light
you dont have a knife do you
this one just died yesterday
its the wrappings that preserved him
what just happened
hes been wrapped up for 500 years
air doesnt agree with him
thanks
i dont wanna keep
borrowing yours all the time
thats fine
i just gonna put it back
was this one open already
its him
its orellana himself
they called him the bullion man
his lust for gold was legendary
its odd
somebody has been here
and gone
they left all this
gold
and all the artifacts
what were they looking for
hold this
oh my
un believable
no tool marks
a single piece of seamless quartz
right across the brain
its not possible even with todays
technology which are huh
crystal is not magnetic
neither is gold
whats is this thing
maybe the nazca indians
thought this was their god
you think this is the one from
akator
maybe the spaniards found the skull
and along with this other loot
theyre headed for their
ships along the shore
maybe the indians caught
up with them while
they got to squabbling amongst
themselves over their prize
killed each other off the indians
wrapped them up and buried them
a couplea 100 years later
oxley shows up here
finds the skull
takes it away
maybe to akator
but then he returns it here
return
return what he wrote
on the walls of his cell
he put it back
where he had found it
why
hello jonesy
hello mac
youre lucky i turned up jonesy
good thing cause they were
gonna blow your brains out
thats the huh third time
i saved your life
unshackle me
ill give you a big hug
you had a lugger
pointing at the place of your
skull first time we met
i had the situation under control
you owe me
whatd you owe them huh
after the war when you turned
how many names
did you give the reds
how many good men died
because of you
eventually theyre gonna let
me out of this chair comrade
and when they do
im gonna break your nose
comrade
you think this is about flags
about you do you think this
is about lines on a map
its about money isnt it
oh not only money
a gigantic pile of money
dont worry about what
the russians will pay
its nothing compared
to whats at akator
an entire city of gold
its what the conquistadors were after
for gods sake jonesy
well be rich
richer than howard hughes
blood money every nickel
i need you to see the
angle here mate
be smart do the right thing
just like in
like in berlin you know mate
just like in berlin
you want me to trot off or huh
should we sing a song
how fortunate of our failure
to kill you dr jones
you survived to be of
service to us once again
well you know me
always glad to help
now ive become death
the destroyer of worlds
you recognize those words
that was your own dr oppenheimer
after he created the atomic bomb
he was quoting the hindu bible
it was nuclear intimidation
but now the next level of
weaponry is ours to have
yours to fear
weapon what weapon
a mind weapons
a new frontier of psychic warfare
that was stalins dream
now i know why oxley put the
skull back where he found it
he knew you were looking for it
the skull is no mere devinity carving
surely you knew that as soon
as you laid eyes on it
it was not made by human hands
who made it then
come on
the body we found in
new mexico was not the first
we already dissected 2 others from
similar crashsites in soviet union
saucermen from mars
the legends about akator
are all true
early man could not have
conceived it much less built it
it was a city of superior beings
with technology and
paranormal abilities
you gotta be kidding me
maybe you choose one
to believe your own eyes
the new mexico specimen
gave us hope
unlike the others we found
this skeleton was pure crystal
a distant cousin perhaps
maybe that too
was sent to find akator
perhaps were all searching
for the same thing
there is no other explanation
theres always another explanation
the skull was stolen from
akator in the 15th century
whoever returns
returns it to the citytemple
will gain control over its powers
i heard that bedtime story before
its a legend why do you
think akator even existed
you should ask your
friend that question
bring in the professor
were certain hes been there
oxley
hey
arent you coming
ox its me indy
ox
youre faking it right
through eyes at last
i saw in tears
ox listen to me pal
your name is harold oxley
you were born in leeds england
you and i went to school togather
at the university of chicago
and you are never this interesting
my name is indi
my name is henry jones jr
what have you done to him
we aint done a thing
its probably the skull
he is the divining role
that will lead us to akator
but we need some one
to interpret him for us
his mind it seams is quite weak
lets hope yours is stronger
the skull crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain
opening the psychic channel
oxley lost control of his mind
by staring to long into its eyes
we believe you can
get through to him
after you have done the same
i got a better idea you look at it
the skull does not speak
to everyone it seams
surely youre not afraid dr jones
you spent your entire life
looking for answers
think of the truth behind those eyes
there maybe hundreds
of skulls at akator
the one who finds them
will control the greatest natural
force the world has ever known
power over the mind of men
be carefull you might get
exactly what you wished for
i usually do
imagine
to peer across the world and
know the enemys secrets
to place all our thoughts
into the minds of your leaders
make your teachers teach the
true version of the history
make your soldiers attack
on our command
well be everywhere at once
more powerfull than a whisper
invading your dreams thinking your
thoughts for you while you sleep
we will change you dr jones
always from the inside
we will turn you into us
and the best part you wont
even know its happening
return
return
thats enough
thats enough if he dies
we cant no joy of him
cover it
henry
what jonesy
he broke my nose
i told you
enough
you will speak to oxley
and lead us to akator yes
njet
take him outside
you all right kid
they left my bike at the cemetery
yeah but youre alright
they left my bike
wough wo wo
stop stop stop stop
uhhuh
im ready
dont give these pigs a thing

a more sensitive one
