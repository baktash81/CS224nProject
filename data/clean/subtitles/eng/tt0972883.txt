tripped over a bush
finger on the trigger
blew it clear off
thuds
hurt like i never imagined
used my jacket
for a tourniquet
but the blood just kept
pumping out of me
i was losing it
couldnt even remember
which way the road was
fading fast
and this fella
starts barking
runs a few paces
keeps barking
like hes encouraging me
id pass out and hed come
bark right in my ear
i pulled myself
almost a mile
before i blacked out
that was his last day
on alpo
laughs
its been top sirloin
ever since
here it is
boy came in
with his father
real snappy dresser
his father
said he had short hair
danny c mccormack
just turned
18 years of age
dog barking
vacuum humming
knocks
vacuum stops
the names
avery ludlow maam
is mr mccormack in
danny would not do that
avery
im afraid he did mr mccormack
daniel was the one
that did the shooting
the other two
just stood by and watched
and then laughed
when it was over
they laughed
thats right
they seemed to think
shooting a dog to death
was a pretty funny thing
does daniel own a tshirt
that says
stolen from mays
whorehouse
laughs
what is it ludlow
you want money
you want money
no sir
im after whatever
justice i can see
coming out of this thing
what i want to know is that
the boy admits to what hes done
and hes made to feel damn
sorry for what he did
thats where you come in
mr mccormack
hes your boy
how do i know what
youre telling me here
is the truth ludlow
huh
what proof have you got
ive got a spent
shell casing
that the sheriffs office could
probably match to the browning
if it needs come to that
but why dont we
just ask him
hey hon
is danny upstairs
yeah
could you go on up there
and tell him come on
downstairs to the study
tell them i said
right now
footsteps approaching
knocking
door opens
danny
hey dad
hey
do you know
this man here
no why
youre absolutely sure
uhhuh
what
this is mr ludlow danny
okay
hes been telling me
a pretty amazing story
told me you tried to
rob him yesterday
that you shot his dog
what
us
are you kidding
mr ludlow is not
kidding no
did you take the browning
out yesterday danny
no no no
we drove to jenny lind
ask mom
she saw us take the car
with who
us and pete
you go anyplace else
no
you go up to millers bend
why would we want to go
to millers bend dad
oh
do you own a tshirt
that says property of
stolen from
stolen from
stolen from mays whorehouse
you own a shirt like that
if i did
id probably wear it
but you dont
own a shirt like that
no
no sir
i got to tell you
i thought the whole story
sounded farfetched from
the very beginning ludlow
i got a couple of
good boys right here
that would not
be involved in
something like what you
were describing to me
im sorry
about your dog
truly am
but um
you got the wrong pair
of kids and thats all
its harold right
danny said
your name yesterday
i want to thank you for lying
to your brother about my rig
couldve brought a couple hundred
dollars or so and you knew that
nice of you not to mention
that to your brother
now suppose
you tell your dad
about my dog
i dont know anything
about your dog mister
the truth would swallow
a whole lot easier son
yeah well i
mr mccormack
thats just about enough ludlow
they said
they didnt do it
and if they said they
didnt do it
they didnt do it
and thats that
i guess youre
just mistaken
well i asked you
excuse me
i said i asked you
asked me what sir
to do the right thing here
it could have been
the right thing maybe
if it had been
the right boys
oh ive got the right boys
mr mccormack
its you whove got
the wrong boys
and i think
you probably know that
thank you for your time
yeah
10 days 100
what
you cant prove
attempted robbery
its just your word
against theirs
so what youve got is a case
of cruelty to animals
maybe reckless conduct
with a firearm
misdemeanors
misdemeanors jesus
under the law an animal
is just property
they have a mandatory
100 fine
he didnt just give
the dog a kick sam
he killed it
its still just cruelty
to animals ave
thats all the law
has to say about it
you can ask for up to
364 days in prison
but practically speaking
no prosecutor in his right mind
is going to request more than 30
and he wouldnt get
more than 10
the sheriff could
at least arrest him
put the fear of god into
the little son of a bitch
to arrest the little
son of a bitch
the sheriff wouldve had to
have seen him pull the trigger
im sorry ave
its no good
i still have to try
all of this time
work and expense
for an old mongrel dog
you already buried
that really what you want
that old mongrel dog
was marys gift to me
for my 50th birthday sam
and they made a joke
about killing him
radio playing
there he is
hey
wheres the old mutt
hes gone emma
gone
a boy shot him
back by millers bend
on sunday
oh my lord
why would
there wasnt any sense to it
just meanness
creaking
car engine starts
tires squeal
sam you know ave last time
we talked it got me thinking
i know how much that dog
meant to you
especially after what happened
with mary and the boys
will they prosecute
all i could get out of them
was a well see
which i guess is better
than a no way
ill be over as soon as
i check with emma
fine
i found out a few things
about mccormack
uhhuh
yeah he made his money in trucking
just like his daddy
he had some runins with
the law when he was younger
there was some talk
about government payoffs
oh married a beauty queen
you see her out there
sure did
yeah he married
pretty well
but im not sure he
treats her that good
anyway all in all
theres plenty of money
and political clout there
but underneath mccormack
is nothing but a redneck
one generation removed
oh i also think
ive found out
who your third boy is
word is danny
and harold hang out
with a kid
named pete doust
man
dont move shit around
with your sewing crap
in the way
i cant find
the remote control
woman
hey open the door
mr doust
im avery ludlow
i know who you are sir
i guess you talked
to mr mccormack then
mr mccormack dont talk to
no outofwork carpenter
his boy called my boy
and
and what
oh mr ludlow
petey says they drove
out to jenny lind
they hung out there
even bought
a couple cds there
goddamn expensive
couple cds
didnt say nothing
about no shotgun
or no old dog
maybe they did drive to
jenny lind before or after
but at about 400
in the afternoon
they were
at millers bend
and when they didnt get
the money they wanted from me
danny mccormack
shot my dog
and your son stood there
with him
laughing about it
look
no hey mr lud ludlow
i heard every word of this
and i want to know
just what you think youre
doing coming out here like this
i mean if you have a
complaint with the mccormacks
why dont you just
take it up with them
you heard that your boy was
party to attempted robbery
that he thought it was funny
that his friend
shot my animal
he didnt shoot your dog
he was there
he saw the boy who did
i want him to say that
maybe hes sorry
you ever think of that
how can he be sorry
if he denies it happened
youre right
it wasnt your boy
who fired the weapon
and id be willing
to forgive him
if hed only show
some nerve and decency
and own up
to his part in it
and tell the sheriff
what danny mccormack did
this is my phone number
i know a boy can be hard
in his heart sometimes
and regret it later on
i only want
the truth from him
tell him to do whats right
thats all im asking
car horn blaring
got a pie cooling
in the back ave
might make this go down
a lot easier
thatll be nice gloria
thank you
evening sam
gloria
ave this is
carrie donnel
from kpzs news over
in portland
mrs donnel
carrie will be just fine thank you
im sorry to hear about red
ive got an idea
i want to run past you
a modified course
of action
what about the present
course of action
well jack wentz declined
to prosecute
and mccormacks already
got himself a lawyer
a fella by the name of cummings
hes good
did you
did you ever throw danny
mccormack out of your store
i never laid eyes
on him before sunday
what theyre saying
is you did
that you threw him out for
trying to steal a penknife
a few months back
or some damn thing
theyre trying to make out
like youre some kind of crank
whos got a grudge
against danny
what about their father
hes backing them up
lying all the way
theyve closed ranks ave
so they got an anonymous
phone call
in the sheriffs office
went down
to investigate it
they found two dogs
barely alive
chained outside
in the yard
it was the dead
of winter
no food no water
the owner had been on vacation
in florida for a week
now the da wasnt going
to prosecute the case
until the local papers
got hold of it
then she changed her mind
how are you guys
doing over here
that pies still waiting
on you in the back ave
oh sure gloria
sure
maybe in a minute huh
are you saying you want to
report all this
on television
i want you to report it
mr ludlow
i want to take a film crew
down to where it happened
well what about slander
you wont name any names
youre just going to tell
your story
what those boys did
and what the das office
isnt willing to do
i want to piss people off
about it
i dont suppose you have
a dog do you carrie
cats
cats
cats mr ludlow three of them
ave will do
just fine carrie
i was sitting down here
oh is that right
thats where we usually
get the best catch
so this is where you were
dave i think you can
just set up over here
red he knew this lake
like his front paws
and he was sitting
just here
thats where he sat
and the boys
sam said you didnt have a tv and
i wouldnt want you to miss the show
this things heavy
you want to get the door for me
oh let me help you
with that
oh no i appreciate
the chivalry ave
but the door
will be just fine
okay
thank you
sighs
so the report ran a few hours
ago but theyre gonna replay it
oh
so wheres your cable connection
right no tv
uh do you have
any wire hangers
wire hangers
yeah
uh yes
try the closet
found one
you were a soldier
mmmhmm
carrie and the dog was a
birthday gift from your wife
avery
yeah thats right
about 13 years ago
and your wife mary
shes gone now isnt she
avery
uhhuh a couple years after that
she never did get to see
red fully grown
carrie
so far the district attorney
has refused
to prosecute the case
nationwide for the killing
and violent abuse of animals
offenders are fined
on average
only 32
of the maximum fine possible
and have spent a mere 14
of the maximum jail time
most offenders never
even come to trial
it has been said that
the greatness of a nation
and its moral progress
can be measured
by the way it treats
its animals
here in york county
it might also be measured
by the justice it seeks
for avery alan ludlow
and his dog red
this is carrie donnel
reporting for kpzs
so what do you think
well i dont know
if itll do any good
but what you said
you certainly said it well
and that means a lot to me
man coughs
carrie screams
are you okay
yeah
car engine revs
well we certainly got
their attention
carrie
well
this mccormack son of a bitch
has got one long reach
the da is still declining
to prosecute
after last night
well there are no prints
on the rock or the note
anybody could have
done it
nobody else had reason to
you know that and i know that
the courts
a different story
but that note implied a threat
maybe thatll help sam
not necessarily
but what it could mean
is that carrie had better
call into work asap
right
dialing
so thats it
no we could still sue
hire our own forensics man
subpoena the shotgun
maybe theyd even settle
but thats just money
yeah just money
so uh you want to
go ahead with this
of course i do
you know i cant do this
for free ave
but ill try to keep
the cost down
thanks sam
i appreciate it
oh come on barry
we cant just lay down and let
yeah but were the only
division that has the freedom
to go after stories like this
if we give into them now were just
sighs
yes yes
no no i understand
yeah
okay
that was my editor
wants me to cover an apartment
building fire instead
a goddamn fire that nobody
was injured in
he got ordered off
yeah damn right he did
its okay carrie
its not your fault
i just cant
walk away from this
but you have to
im so sorry ave
okay
oh boy
when i drink
i get so hungry
you know what i could use
i could use a piece of that
cherry pie right about now
and speaking
of sweet things
you know i think that
waitress was sweet on you
who
gloria
its those eyes
and of course now youve
been on television
you better look out
youre crazy
maybe you should have
some cherry pie
soak up some
of that alcohol
thank you
you know ave
im just so disappointed
i swore that i would
never let
ive been suited for this job
from the very beginning
and im good at it
i know what i want
what about you ave
what do you want
out of this life
there must be something
the truth
the truth about what
when i lost mary
all i had left of her was
a house our store
and red
those boys nearly took
all that away from me
and i
i just need to make
some sense of it
what if you cant find the
answers that youre looking for
what if theres no answer
how do you know when
to stop trying
i learned one thing
during the war
that you fight with
whatever youve got
whatever you can
lay your hands on
and you never stop
the minute you do
thats the minute the world
rolls right over you
this is mary
she was 53 there
she was beautiful
she never thought so
carrie
well she was wrong
she looked so young
for her age
how old are you ave
i ever ask you that
no
well then
how come you dont have
any pictures of your sons
i dont have any sons
yes you do
sam told me
he shouldnt have
we had timmy late
i was 48
mary was 42
so it was a kind of surprise
to both of us
we had to fix up the attic in
order to give him a bedroom
he was a good boy
an easy boy
favored mary that way
but the older boy billy
had been different
right from the start
he always had a way of turning
a good thing sour on himself
he always had
a problem with lying
here at home
and to other people
he dropped out of school when
they kept him back junior year
went to work for clovers
hardware here in town
got to work late
half the time
stayed out nights
made up lies about why
he always had
this way with him
like he couldnt
help himself
i got this idea in my head
that he might work it out
for himself in the service
get some discipline in his life
it had worked for me
maybe he wanted to leave
the house by then anyway
because it was one of the few
times he listened to me
and did what i told him to
he joined the navy
nine months later
he was out
on a section 8
do you know what that is
mentally unstable
unfit is the word
they use
the night it happened
i was with emma
down at the store
taking the sixmonth
inventory
it was the dead of winter
tim was asleep
in the bedroom upstairs
mary was reading
in the kitchen
it was about 1130
by the time
we finished the inventory
when he told
the story later
to the police
to the detectives
to the lawyers
billy lied
but it was confused lying
it was as if he couldnt actually
remember what had happened
hed lie about one thing
and then tell the truth about
whatever the hell that was
and then go back and lie
about the first thing again
or something
completely different
it just went on that way
but how we pieced it
together was
billy had come around the house
earlier that evening
looking for some money
mary told him no
told him if he wanted money
hed have to come down to
the store and talk to me
well he knew he wasnt
going to do that
id had it by then
so they argued
and eventually he left
then just before 1100
he came back to the house
again still looking for money
and mary still told
him no again
i dont know why
but he
locked red here
up here in the bedroom
maybe he was barking
i dont know
then he went back out
to the kitchen
and started hitting her
beating her
maybe he thought hed get
money from her that way
maybe it was just one
of his crazy rages
but he hurt her
he hurt her so bad
i guess he thought
hed killed her
because then he decided
he decided hed have to
cover up what he did
so he went out
to the tool shed
and got the can of kerosene
i used to keep out there
went up to the attic bedroom
and threw it all over tim
all over my son
who was lying asleep
he burned him to death
up there in his room
but kerosene doesnt burn
as hot as gasoline
i mean
he killed tim all right
the boy was saturated
with the stuff
but all that burned
up there was my son
and the mattress he lay on
not even the drapes
caught fire
he
closed the bedroom door
locked it behind him
stood outside and waited
till my son
stopped screaming
until it was quiet
then he came back down
and threw the kerosene over mary
lying on the kitchen floor lit
another match and threw that on her
then got into his car
and drove away
but she
my wife
wasnt dead
oh hed hurt her
but he hadnt killed her
she was still alive
hed got it wrong
wrong about that just like
he was wrong
about the kerosene
burning the house down
he was wrong about
everything always
it was all for nothing
i guess the pain woke her
she managed to get
herself outside
and roll across the ground
on the dirt and the grass
until the flames were out
then she still had
enough left in her
to crawl back into the house
and dial 911
they found her on the stairs
halfway up to tims bedroom
she lived
for another five days
never did come out
of the coma
i think that was
a blessing
her burns were so bad
they wouldnt let me
hold her
in the end
i did anyway
dog barking
thank you
car starts
danny pete
pete im leaving right now
i dont care
no
leave a little bit
pete
i didnt fucking take it
dont you lie
go back in the house
you crazy bitch
fuck you
fuck me
spits
fuck you
engine starts
that is disgusting man
girl giggling
youre touching me but
youre not looking at me
ow
im going
are you going
i want to go home
danny i had a nice time
danny laughing
ill tell you in the car
hes such a dick
i hate him
pete laughing
what are you doing
danny
i dont know
shes the most irritating
girl ive ever met
laughing
i saw you parked here
danny didnt
where is he
hes down the street
at bowmans auto
does he know youre here
no
no i told him
i needed cigarettes
you know hed be pretty damn mad
if he knew i was talking to you
would he
yeah
you and him argue a lot
your brother
look mr ludlow
im not gonna pretend that
things are all buddybuddy
between danny and me
thats not why im here
thats not my point
what is your point then
that um
that i just wanted
to say sorry
you know for what we did
about your dog
thats why im here
im here to say that
im glad to hear it
though the one i need
to hear it from most
is your brother
im still glad to hear
it from you though
question is what now
what do you
what do you
are you gonna keep on
lying for him
god i mean what do you
expect me to do
i mean first you come and you
ask me in front of my father
then you go
and you get it on tv
i expect you
to tell the truth
i expect you
to tell your father
i expect you to tell the
police if it comes to that
you dont get it
you dont understand
thats just not gonna happen
suppose you
make me understand
look i gotta go
all right
if danny sees me here
who are you
afraid of harold
your brother
your father
you were man enough to come down
here and say what you just said to me
i figure that already
makes you a bigger man
than your brother
and maybe even
your father
i dont think
youve got all that much
to worry about
from either of them
do you
believe me mr ludlow
you dont have a clue
mr mccormack
hon what is it
i was going to vacuum
and
so i hear
youre suing me
id rather not
yeah
i dont know why
you bother
its not gonna be worth either
your time or your money
im wondering if youre proud
of daniel mr mccormack
because if not
then theres gonna be trouble
between you and the boy
and thats something you may
care to do something about
while you still have time
instead of using your money
to cover up for him
you know i dont need
any lectures from you
my boys are my boys
and ill handle them any way
i see fit okay
if youre gonna sue me
just go ahead and do it
itll cause me
some embarrassment
in some places
but it wont
hurt me very
very much
so do it
and if you could win what
are you gonna get out of it
the value of a dog
a goddamn dog from
a goddamn dog pound
huh
huh
really i could
care less either way
do you understand
do you understand ave
mmhmm
i guess i do
you guess you do
