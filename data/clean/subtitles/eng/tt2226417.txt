a camera problem
then it became apparent
that it was more than that
i interviewed the boy
he wont tell me anything
hes afraid
im afraid too
theres something in this house
i can feel it
it doesnt want me here
may i meet him
hi josh im elise
i would love to ask you
some simple questions
do you like living here
yeah i guess
are there a lot of kids your
age in this neighborhood
a few
one kid lives next door
that must be fun
is there anything you dont like
about living in this house
i have bad dreams sometimes
what happens in your dreams
id like to try something
with you josh
and i promise it wont hurt
i want you to just relax
listen to the ticking
focus on it

miss lambert
i think your son has a
unique ability a gift
when he sleeps at night hes
able to go places see things
things no living person
is supposed to see
only now one of the
dead has seen him too
oh my god
well can you stop it
i could take away his gift
to suppress his memory
of his ability
how would we do that
ill show you
do whatever you have to
make him forget
one morning dalton
just wouldnt wake up
we took him to the best
doctors we could find
but none of them had any idea
eventually
we just took him home
still in his coma
then things started
happening around the house
unexplained things
i got so freaked out we moved
but they kept happening
and you believe that there was
some sort of supernatural force at work
when did you hire the services
of the deceased elise rainier
when we ran out
of places to go
it says in your
statement mrs lambert
that last night at
approximately 1000 pm
elise put your husband
into a state of hypnosis
she did this as
part of a ritual that
she believed would allow him to
project his unconscious
into a uh
im sorry i cant read
my own handwriting
into a spirit realm where
he could locate your son
and bring him back
to consciousness
now did you really
believe that would help
i had to whatever
she did it worked
dalton woke up
and what happened
after your son woke up
josh
josh where are you
josh
renai
im right here
what
renai
oh no no no
elise elise
mom get dalton out of here
call an ambulance
no no no elise
oh no
no no
what
why are you looking
at me like that
you think i did this
did you believe him
hes my husband thats
not what i asked
yes i believed him my husband
isnt capable of killing anybody
this is a photo elise took
seconds before she was killed
can you tell me who that
is in this picture
there were a lot of strange
things happening in our house
i saw apparitions
lots of them
are you telling me that this
is a photograph of a ghost
listen im not interested
in ghosts mrs lambert
im interested in the living
people who create them
elise has marks on her neck
that were put there
by human hands
ill let you know if forensics
matches those marks to your husband
jessica were home
hey guys
dad look what i made hey
what
its a cup phone
see you put your ear in that
and i put my mouth in that
you are a genius absolute brilliance
thanks for watching them
say hi to your mom from me
i will
oh mom
ill get that
ill go up and make the beds
all right
time for bed boys
how long are we
gonna be here for
were gonna be at grandmas
house for a little bit
while the police
work at our house
you know this house has been
in the family for a long time
and you eyes
get to stay in
daddys old bedroom
did you see
anything bad in here
no
and neither will you okay
okay
good night
what
just glad youre awake
good night boys
good night
hey dalton
what
look what i made
do i have to
yeah
this is stupid
come on it really works i wanna
ask you something all right
all right fine the
string needs to be tight
go farther back
okay
so what do you think of this
i think its stupid
hey
lorraine
its okay
its still happening
what is
i heard the piano playing
by itself downstairs
and i found kali on the floor
of her room by her crib
well maybe she
climbed out of her crib
has she ever done that before
what what is
wrong with you
renai i just want us to move
on from this thats all
i want us to be
a normal family again
there is nothing normal about this okay
these things are still here
elise is dead no ones talking about it
someone murdered her
then lets talk about it
you think i did it
no no i dont
good good
because i know what happened
i went into that place
to get our son back
and something evil followed
me and killed elise
you saw it
you saw those things
listen to me nothing is gonna
bother us not anymore
we have our family back
we have our son
isnt that what
we should be focusing on
yeah
you think all the
ghosts weve seen
would somehow make me feel
better that elise is gone
i mean you and i have
firsthand knowledge that theres
something out there beyond death
but its not helping
turns out the living version
of someone is always better
she never left the
reading room unlocked
you first
hunter ninja bear
hunter ninja bear
thats bullshit
how does a bear
beat a goddamn ninja
superior sense
of smell my friend
you know what i dont think
we should be down here
lets go back
thats a private room
you should stay
see
oh my nuts
im not helping
hi josh im elise
hey
i would love to ask you
some simple questions
but theyre the good kind
the kind you cant get wrong
do you like living here
yeah
amateur framing
just horrible
a few
one kid lives next door
can you stop it
i could try
to take away his gift
to suppress his
memory of his ability
how would we do that
ill show you
who the hells he talking to
i could try
to take away his gift
to suppress his
memory of his ability
how would we do that
ill show you
right there
sleep
then i flew away
please dont leave us again
grandma
mmmhmm
theres someone
standing behind you
renai
oh my god josh
mom
did you see her
i saw someone
no you didnt no i did
there was somebody
ma there is no one here okay
because if there was
that would scare my family
and i dont need renai hearing
any of that stuff right now

yeah youre right
um
it was probably my imagination
yeah
sorry you should
get some sleep
you want some more
all right go farther back so we can stretch it

last night i saw
someone in my house
i need your help
do you remember the first
time elise visited your house
to talk to josh
when he was a boy
no i did a lot
to try to
try to forget that part of
my life until recently
all right well
elise hypnotized him
asked him a series
of questions
i digitized the actual footage
taken from the night
i cropped and
lightened the image
what
lorraine is that josh
how is that possible
we dont know
if only elise
were here to help us
what
hello
renai lambert
this is detective sendai
oh

in the letters
elise we are
calling out to you

parker wore that dress
to commit these murders

he wanted his childhood back

remember me josh
elise and i did our best
to make sure of that
youre right
i dont remember you
your mother called me when you
started experiencing some problems
and what i saw scared me so badly
that i uh reached out to elise
now elise is gone
i was wondering if you could
help give me some closure
i need it
sure
okay
phew
this is pretty exciting
i feel like an fbi agent
tell me what youre thinking
lorraine what do you know
i think that when josh went
into that other world
something else came back
we believe its a
spirit thats killed
many times before
and itll kill again
thats why i had to get you
and the kids away from him
last night when i
looked into his eyes
like i have every day
for the last 12 years
was the first time
i didnt recognize him
i was scared of him
right now at the house
there is an acquaintance of elises
and mine and hes talking to josh
were going to try to sedate
him and when hes under
were going to try to reach
out to the real josh
and what if we cant find him
are you feeling okay
im fine
just woke up feeling
a little under the weather
i suppose i wanted to ask you
if youve any idea
what happened to elise
no i dont
look i
i should remind you that um
im not the person whos
gonna look at you funny
if you tell me
something unusual
mmmhmm
ive seen things
with my own eyes
that most people have to
go to sleep to conjure up
elise sent me to a place
that still haunts my dreams
but i got my son back
i dont know i left the
room for about 10 minutes
and when i came back
elise was dead
she had been strangled
thats pretty horrific
i guess
oh
um
when you were a boy
you said it was an old
woman who haunted you
did you see that same old woman
when you were in
that other world
no
okay um
say would you like a drink
water a glass of
water would be nice
sure
what you got there
huh oh uh

playing with your dice

it was on the baby monitor
probably just interference
i dont know
it sounded so clear it was
like this whispering it was
scared the hell out of me
then i went to hear the
monitor and turned up the volume
and heard a mans voice
i ran up there

memories live from her life
use those memories to draw
her out of your vessel
so that you can get
back into your body
