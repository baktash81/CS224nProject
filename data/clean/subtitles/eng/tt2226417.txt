carl told me on the phone
your son is the one
affected  is that right 
yes  that s right 
my son  josh 
something is following him 
show her 
i started with
all the usual checks 
mental health tests 
medical records 
everything normal 
then i saw the photos 
first noticed it
about six weeks ago 
thought it was
a camera problem 
then it became apparent
that it was more than that 
i interviewed the boy 
he won t tell me anything 
he s afraid 
i m afraid  too 
there s something in this house 
i can feel it 
it doesn t want me here 
may i meet him 
hi  josh  i m elise 
i would love to ask you
some simple questions 
do you like living here 
yeah  i guess 
are there a lot of kids your
age in this neighborhood 
a few 
one kid lives next door 
that must be fun 
is there anything you don t like
about living in this house 
i have bad dreams sometimes 
what happens in your dreams 
i d like to try something
with you  josh 
and i promise  it won t hurt 
i want you to just relax 
listen to the ticking 
focus on it 
tune everything else out 
feel yourself getting sleepier 
we are now inside
your dream  josh 
look around 
what do you see 
i see myself
sleeping in bed 
are you in your bedroom 
no 
i m somewhere dark 
it s always dark here 
are you alone 
no 
she s here 
who is  she  
she says she s a friend 
she visits me every night 
where is she
right at this moment 
is she here in
this house with us 
i d like to talk to her 
okay  we re gonna play
a little game  josh 
it s called hot and cold 
i ll walk around the house 
and you tell me if i m
getting warmer or colder 
cold 
warm 
warmer 
colder 
getting warm 
hotter 
it s very hot 
please get out of there 
who are you 
what do you want 
what happened 
i saw what haunts him 
and it s not a friend 
it s a parasite  i ve never
felt such a malignant presence 
it wants to be him 
miss lambert 
i think your son has a
unique ability  a gift 
when he sleeps at night  he s
able to go places  see things 
things no living person
is supposed to see 
only now  one of the
dead has seen him  too 
oh  my god 
well  can you stop it 
i could take away his gift
to suppress his memory
of his ability 
how would we do that 
i ll show you 
do whatever you have to 
make him forget 
one morning  dalton
just wouldn t wake up 
we took him to the best
doctors we could find 
but none of them had any idea 
eventually 
we just took him home 
still in his coma 
then things started
happening around the house 
unexplained things 
i got so freaked out  we moved 
but they kept happening 
and you believe that there was
some sort of supernatural force at work 
when did you hire the services
of the deceased elise rainier 
when we ran out
of places to go 
it says in your
statement  mrs  lambert 
that last night  at
approximately 10 00 p m  
elise put your husband
into a state of hypnosis 
she did this as
part of a ritual that
she believed would allow him to
 project his unconscious
into a     uh   
i m sorry  i can t read
my own handwriting 
    into a spirit realm  where
he could locate your son 
 and bring him back
to consciousness  
now  did you really
believe that would help 
i had to  whatever
she did  it worked 
dalton woke up 
and what happened
after your son woke up 
josh 
josh  where are you 
josh 
renai 
i m right here 
what 
renai 
oh  no  no  no 
elise  elise 
mom  get dalton out of here 
call an ambulance 
no  no  no  elise 
oh  no 
no  no 
what 
why are you looking
at me like that 
you think i did this 
did you believe him 
he s my husband  that s
not what i asked 
yes  i believed him  my husband
isn t capable of killing anybody 
this is a photo elise took
seconds before she was killed 
can you tell me who that
is in this picture 
there were a lot of strange
things happening in our house 
i saw apparitions 
lots of them 
are you telling me that this
is a photograph of a ghost 
listen  i m not interested
in ghosts  mrs  lambert 
i m interested in the living
people who create them 
elise has marks on her neck
that were put there
by human hands 
i ll let you know if forensics
matches those marks to your husband 
jessica  we re home 
hey  guys 
dad  look what i made  hey 
what 
it s a cup phone 
see  you put your ear in that 
and i put my mouth in that 
you are a genius  absolute brilliance 
thanks for watching them 
say hi to your mom from me 
i will 
oh  mom 
i ll get that 
i ll go up and make the beds 
all right 
time for bed  boys 
how long are we
gonna be here for 
we re gonna be at grandma s
house for a little bit
while the police
work at our house 
you know  this house has been
in the family for a long time 
and you eyes
get to stay in
daddy s old bedroom 
did you see
anything bad in here 
no 
and neither will you  okay 
okay 
good night 
what 
just glad you re awake 
good night  boys 
good night 
hey  dalton 
what 
look what i made 
do i have to 
yeah 
this is stupid 
come on  it really works  i wanna
ask you something  all right 
all right  fine  the
string needs to be tight 
go farther back 
okay 
so  what do you think of this 
i think it s stupid 
hey 
lorraine 
it s okay 
it s still happening 
what is 
i heard the piano playing
by itself downstairs
and i found kali on the floor
of her room by her crib 
well  maybe she
climbed out of her crib 
has she ever done that before 
what  what is
wrong with you 
renai  i just want us to move
on from this  that s all 
i want us to be
a normal family again 
there is nothing normal about this  okay 
these things are still here 
elise is dead  no one s talking about it 
someone murdered her 
then let s talk about it 
you think i did it 
no  no  i don t 
good  good 
because i know what happened 
i went into that place
to get our son back
and something evil followed
me and killed elise 
you saw it 
you saw those things 
listen to me  nothing is gonna
bother us  not anymore 
we have our family back 
we have our son 
isn t that what
we should be focusing on 
yeah 
you think all the
ghosts we ve seen
would somehow make me feel
better that elise is gone 
i mean  you and i have
firsthand knowledge that there s
something out there beyond death 
but it s not helping 
turns out the living version
of someone is always better 
she never left the
reading room unlocked 
you first 
hunter  ninja  bear 
hunter  ninja  bear 
that s bullshit 
how does a bear
beat a goddamn ninja 
superior sense
of smell  my friend 
you know what  i don t think
we should be down here 
let s go back 
that s a private room 
you should stay   
see 
oh  my nuts 
i m not helping 
hi  josh  i m elise 
hey 
i would love to ask you
some simple questions 
but they re the good kind 
the kind you can t get wrong 
do you like living here 
yeah 
amateur framing 
just horrible 
a few 
one kid lives next door 
can you stop it 
i could try
to take away his gift
to suppress his
memory of his ability 
how would we do that 
i ll show you 
who the hell s he talking to 
i could try
to take away his gift 
to suppress his
memory of his ability 
how would we do that 
i ll show you 
right there 
   sleep 
then i flew away 
please don t leave us again 
grandma

oh  my god  josh 
mom 
did you see her 
i saw someone 
no  you didn t  no  i did 
there was somebody

because if there was 
that would scare my family 
and i don t need renai hearing
any of that stuff right now

yeah  you re right 
um   
it was probably my imagination 
yeah 
sorry  you should
get some sleep

and he was talking to someone 
you have to go 
is there something
wrong with daddy  mom

last night i saw
someone in my house 
i need your help 
do you remember the first
time elise visited your house
to talk to josh
when he was a boy 
no  i did a lot
to try to   
try to forget that part of
my life  until recently 
all right  well 
elise hypnotized him 
asked him a series
of questions 
i digitized the actual footage
taken from the night 
i cropped and
lightened the image 
what 
lorraine  is that josh 
how is that possible 
we don t know 
if only elise
were here to help us 
what 
hello 
renai lambert 
this is detective sendai 
oh 
hello  detective 
i told you i would inform you
once i got the forensics results 
well  i got some 
it seems the bruises
on elise rainier s neck
do not match your
husband s hands 
we re not ruling
anything out at this point 
but i just thought
you should know 
thank you  detective 
uh   
i really needed to hear that

i had been meaning to catch
up with her  to call her

till the next week  you know 
and now she s gone 
well  maybe this is your
chance to say your good byes 
specs told me on the phone 
but i m not sure we should   
we have questions
that need answering 
and the only person we could
think of to ask is elise 
please help us  carl 
help us contact her 
everybody has their
own way of making contact 
this is mine 
i ask questions and the
spirits answer with the dice 
you look for the words
in the letters 
elise  we are
calling out to you 
tell us if you are there 
elise  please talk to us 
give us a sign that
you can hear my voice 
all right  i suppose
i should ve explained
that this isn t
an exact science 
sometimes contact
can t be made 
elise 
please tell me  are you here 
are you here 
i ll go get   
no 
do not break the circle 
elise

renai 
renai 
most of my work

personally  i
prefer the ghosts to people 
the question is

he jumped to his death 
so  why was he
here in the first place 
he tried to castrate himself 
oh  no

i wanna live

only if you kill them 
no  please  no

i know 
i have seen it 
i have seen where
these things exist 
they want what you have 
life 
but they have
no power over you 
all you have to do is ignore
them  and they will go away

 as an old woman dressed in a
black wedding gown and veil  
 bride in black
claims his 15th victim  
victims 
oh  my god 
wait a sec 
uh   
parker wore that dress
to commit these murders 
it was his disguise 
he killed for his mother
because she forced him to 
he wanted his childhood back 
that s why he went
after your son 
renai 
jesus  lorraine

remember me  josh 
elise and i did our best
to make sure of that 
you re right 
i don t remember you 
your mother called me when you
started experiencing some problems
and what i saw scared me so badly
that i  uh  reached out to elise 
now elise is gone 
i was wondering if you could
help give me some closure 
i need it 
sure 
okay 
phew 
this is pretty exciting 
i feel like an fbi agent 
tell me what you re thinking 
lorraine  what do you know 
i think that when josh went
into that other world 
something else came back 
we believe it s a
spirit that s killed
many times before 
and it ll kill again 
that s why i had to get you
and the kids away from him 
last night  when i
looked into his eyes 
like i have every day
for the last 12 years 
was the first time
i didn t recognize him 
i was scared of him 
right now  at the house 
there is an acquaintance of elise s
and mine  and he s talking to josh 
we re going to try to sedate
him and when he s under 
we re going to try to reach
out to the real josh 
and what if we can t find him 
are you feeling okay 
i m fine 
just woke up feeling
a little under the weather 
i suppose i wanted to ask you
if you ve any idea
what happened to elise 
no  i don t 
look  i   
i should remind you that  um   
i m not the person who s
gonna look at you funny
if you tell me
something unusual 
mmm hmm 
i ve seen things
with my own eyes
that most people have to
go to sleep to conjure up 
elise sent me to a place
that still haunts my dreams 
but i got my son back 
i don t know  i left the
room for about 10 minutes 
and when i came back 
elise was dead 
she had been strangled 
that s pretty horrific 
i guess 
oh 
um   
when you were a boy 
you said it was an old
woman who haunted you 
did you see that same old woman
when you were in
that other world 
no 
okay  um   
say  would you like a drink 
water  a glass of
water would be nice 
sure 
what you got there

like this whispering  it was   
scared the hell out of me 
then i went to hear the
monitor and turned up the volume
and heard a man s voice

belong in your world 
i don t know how to fight her 
out there in the darkness

memories live from her life 
use those memories to draw
her out of your vessel
so that you can get
back into your body 
but where do i find her home 
only you know where that is 
i don t remember

the wrong josh 
what happened 
i saw what haunts him  and it s not a friend

i ve never felt such
a malignant presence 
it wants to be him
