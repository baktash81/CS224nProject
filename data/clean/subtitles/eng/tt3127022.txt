 the covers of the books
are like a roof and four walls  
 a house  
she  more than anything else in the world 
loved the moment when you finish the book 
and the story keeps playing
like the most vivid dream in your head 
and after that 
she loved taking long walks
to clear her mind
of all the emotions and feelings
the book had started within her 
that very morning 
after hazy years of reading
and walking 
and mourning the death of her husband 
florence green woke up knowing
exactly what she wanted to do 
she was going to open a bookshop in the
little village where she d ended up living 
i am convinced that this bookshop
will be everything you say  mrs  green 
but  of course  for now i can give you
no definite commitment on behalf of the bank 
the decision does not depend upon me 
and i have your honest assurance
that you have ample experience in the trade 
i learned the trade very thoroughly
when i was a girl 
and i don t believe it s changed
greatly since then 
and more importantly i know   
i love reading 
well  it would do little harm
to let you know one or two things 
consider them words of advice
if you prefer 
she had a great heart 
and enormous patience 
but not even these two virtues
were strong enough
to bear the grandiloquent
and patronizing tones
of mr  keble 
the hardborough banker 
whom everyone called
mr potatohead behind his back 
i should tell you
there are those who believe
there are other possible uses
for the old house 
of course  there is always
a possibility of a resale 
but i have no intention of reselling  mr keble 
not in the slightest 
what else do people think
the old house could be used for 
why have they done nothing about it
in the past seven years 
there were birds nesting in it 
half the tiles were off the roof 
and it stank of rats 
wouldn t it be better to fill the place
with books for people to look at 
i read before going to sleep 
and i usually drift off
to the land of nod by about the third page 
so you see  don t you realize
how useful books can be 
the weather in this part of the world
was totally unpredictable 
sometimes all four seasons
could be present in a single morning 
that sunny day 
she left the bank
feeling angry  proud  impatient 
and terribly alive 
she was going to pursue her dream 
and nobody  not even mr  potatohead 
was going to stop her 
hello  mrs  green 
are you busy 
hello  mr  raven 
not at the moment  why 
can i throw the rope to you 
yes  of course 
watch out 
very slippery 
that s how ethan broke his leg yesterday 
but i m well aware that you are a woman
who don t frighten easily 
how do you know that 
rumour has it that you re about
to open a bookshop here 
why do you feel it s something daring 
the only person here who reads
is mr  brundish 
i don t think he s going to
be leaving home to be your customer 
i think i saw him yesterday on the hill 
well  caught a glimpse of him anyway 
i imagine you had
a long conversation 
yes  never stopped talking 
yeah  right 
good luck  mrs  green 
do you not read  mr  raven 
i don t 
books leave me exhausted 
real life is enough for me 
mr  brundish lived alone
in the oldest house in hardborough 
he didn t particularly
like his own company 
but  after long years of battle 
he had reached a lasting truce
with himself 
he adored books with the same passion
with which he detested his fellow men 
he often cherished the fantasy that the
volumes he devoured from morning till night
hadn t been written by human beings 
but had appeared through
spontaneous generation 
there was nothing that bothered him more
than the protraits of writers
often included in certain editions 
it s not red 
it is a very deep maroon
or rust 
anyway  how is the old house 
how are you coping 
sam wilkins was in and fixed
the bath  and tarred the roof 
and repaired the system as best he could
anyway 
that place is like an old fossil 
even the straw is 500 years old 
ok  arms up 
there 
you are still going to move
in there  aren t you 
i spent my first night there
last night 
what  so soon 
i told everyone to watch out 
nobody actually thought you were going to
move into the old house 
yes  i know they didn t  but it was fine 
a bit creepy in the night 
but that s because
i m not used to it yet  i suppose 
i should think a wooden and old house
like that creaks everywhere 
i m afraid red isn t really for me 
i mean it doesn t really look
good on me from behind  but   
perhaps if i stand against the wall
next time i m there   
  too red  don t you think 
  it s not   
it s not red 
it is a very deep maroon 
yes 
you ll get used to it in time 
need a bit of jewellery
to make it stand out 
yes 
  you sure 
  well  of course i m sure 
it s not every day the general
and mrs gamart invite you to a party  is it 
stop agonizing 
you look   
lovely 
anyway  when you get there 
you won t have to worry how you look 
no one will mind you 
they ll probably know
all the guests anyhow 
i m florence green 
i am the one opening
the little bookshop 
that s it  of course 
thought of it right away 
of course  violet was very interested
in that matter 
she wanted one of those
conversations of hers   
with you about the bookshop 
she s rather caught up right now 
but i believe she wishes
to talk to you later 
so   
what sort of stuff are you going
to have in your shop 
well   
basically books 
they don t publish many
books of poetry these days  do they 
i don t see too many about 
i shall have some poetry  of course 
but it doesn t sell quite so well
as other things like novels and essays 
it will take me some time to find out
what kind of stock i ll bring in 
for the moment i ve mainly ordered classics 
thackeray  dickens  keats   
 it is easy to be dead  
 say only this  
 they are dead  
do you know who wrote that 
no 
i m so sorry  i don t 
i know who you are 
must be mrs  green 
yes 
i know who you are  of course  mr  north 
though i ve never had an invitation to the stead before 
i expect you come here often 
yes  i do get invited frequently 
oh  thank you  very kind 
not very 
you live on your own  don t you 
you ve just moved into the old house 
all by yourself 
war widow 
i know 
have you never thought
of marrying again 
no 
the problem is i was
very happily married 
how odd 
i was always under the impression that it s
precisely when a woman is widowed
that she starts to get happy 
are you sure you ve received
the proper advice to run a business 
i ve never met you before now  mr  north 
but i assumed  because of your work 
you d be someone who d appreciate
having a bookshop in hardborough 
i m sure you know
writers at the bbc 
and thinkers and and so forth 
i trust they come down here
from time to time to see you and get some fresh air 
if they did come   
i wouldn t know what to do with them 
writers will go anywhere
where there is a free drink 
i m not so sure about thinkers 
i think kattie  my so called girlfriend 
would look after them 
anyway  you must both come to my shop 
i shall rely on you 
on no account 
why are you wearing red 
red s the colour that only looks good
on housemaids on their day off 
it s not red  it s a deep maroon 
my dear lady 
florence  isn t it 
yes 
i ve been wanting to speak to you
since you arrived 
but my guests have nothing better to do
than steer me away from my priorities 
thank you so much for coming 
  thanks for inviting me 
  it s a pleasure 
  it s such a lovely party 
  everyone is talking about your new ventures 
you have such a great nose for business 
bruno 
have you been introduced to my husband 
come and tell mrs     
green 
how delighted we are to see her 
and to think we ve all been praying
for a good bookshop in our little town 
haven t we  bruno 
of course  my dear 
there s no harm in praying 
things would probably go much better
if we all prayed more 
just one thing  ms  green 
and a very small one at that 
you haven t actually moved
into the old house  have you 
yes  i have been there over a week 
but there s no water 
sam wilkins connected the pipes for me 
don t forget  violet  you ve been
in london a good deal lately 
and you haven t been able
to control everything 
why shouldn t i have moved in 
i believe i can spare you
many disappointments
and maybe even a bit of money 
in fact  i hope to help you 
there are much more appropriate locations
in hardborough 
especially for a bookshop 
i m afraid we are all so used to
seeing the old house empty 
that we ve procrastinated
year after year 
you ve practically showed us all
by being in such a hurry  mrs  green 
but the fact is   
many of us are not at all convinced
by the sudden transformation of the old house
into a shop 
many of us believe
it should be a kind of   
local art centre 
fine  violet 
you could pray for that also 
chamber music in summer 
lectures in winter   
there is simply no other old house
that has that   
ambience 
i ve been negotiating the sale
for over six months  so   
you see  it s hard for me to believe
there s anyone left in hardborough
who doesn t know about it 
in fact  i m sure
they all know 
we have one great advantage 
it would be a shame to just   
throw it away 
now we have exactly the right person
to take charge of the matter 
i mean to take charge of the centre 
you do understand  don t you 
why don t you think it over
for a bit 
sonia 
how wonderful 
her feet and head ached 
and she regretted having taken
the seamstress  advice
as to the colour of her dress 
that was all 
not for one moment did she
think about the consequences
that her modest act of inhabiting
the old house would bring upon her 
you look radiant 
isn t that that lord gosfield 
what a guest list this evening  violet 
lord gosfield 
how difficult it has been
to try and reach you this evening  
i hope bruno has told you
about our new hardborough centre
for music and the arts 
we were just talking about it 
mrs  green 
hi 
  good morning 
  glad i caught you 
  how are you 
  very well thanks  very well 
i wanted to ask you about my shop 
i wanted to speak to you about my shop 
  it s up for auction 
  yes 
not until april 
it could be later still 
well  the fact is   
i d much prefer to reach
a private agreement before 
as you ve expressed a certain interest
in the property 
and since you re not going
to remain in the old house   
i trust that you appreciate
that i am too busy
to pay attention
to the rumours that i hear 
well  it stands to reason you ll be making
an offer on the premises 
there s been a misunderstanding 
mr  deben  but   
yes  but it doesn t matter in the slightest 
and i   
i should like
to be able to help you 
mrs  gamart was   
kind enough to tell me
about her idea for an art centre 
from which i am sure everyone of us
living here in hardborough would benefit 
and i believe she is the one
who is searching about for premises 
and what could be better
than your fish shop 
yes  i see 
you ve been extremely kind 
  thank you for your help 
  you re welcome  mr  deben 
  good morning 
  yes  thank you  mrs  green 
florence had managed to
live life thus far
by pretending that human beings
were not divided
into exterminators and exterminated 
with the former
at any moment predominating 
i didn t know
if you d be down in london or   
london  no  i m here 
well  i think i am 
nescafé 
i ve never tried it 
i have heard of it  but i   
i m told it s not made
with boiling water 
yes 
  this is all much too small for you 
  i know 
you know  i m glad
that you ve dropped in 
no one else compels me
to face the truth 
well  that s fortunate
because i ve come to ask you a question 
when mrs  gamart was talking at her party
about the ideal person
to run an art centre 
it was you  of course 
that she had in mind  wasn t it 
it wasn t me 
sorry  violet s party 
did she expect me just to move out of my house
and probably  for that matter  out of the town altogether 
assuming that you would come
to the old house to   
manage everything 
if she d been referring to me  i doubt very much
she would have used the word  manage  
do you fancy nescafé or   
not 
no  neither  thank you 
  are you sure 
  yes 
  do you mind if i    
  no  no  please 
i should probably get going 
are you   really 
yes  thank you anyway 
well   it s lovely to see you 
well  from what i ve heard 
and practically by chance 
you ve started to think twice
about the whole bookshop operation 
well  then you ve heard wrong 
mr  thornton 
i am here to demand that all unresolved matters
be resolved as quickly as possible
so that i might set up the bookshop
without further delay 
  but i was told that you   
  what 
that i d be leaving the old house 
which  by the way  is my only home 
there are many other vacant properties
in hardborough 
as it happens  i have a list of some
of the more out of the way ones 
i expect no further delays  mr  thornton 
please have all pending papers sent to me 
and  once again 
i am ever so grateful for your help 
is there something
i can help you with  boys 
we are sea scouts  ma am 
yes  i see  and just what is it
that you re doing here 
mr  raven told us to stop around 
what would you like us to do 
i want all the book shelves put up in there 
do you think you can manage that 
how many hand drills
can you get us  ma am 
you ve all been waiting here
in the pouring rain 
if i can find my keys   
okay  hurry up 
when ms  green opened the first
box of books she had ordered 
all the problems and obstacles
of those past few days
simply vanished 
with each edition  the faces
and the words of mrs  gamart 
the banker 
her lawyer 
and milo north 
all faded away 
and  for a moment 
she felt that her late husband 
whom she had loved so dearly 
was with her once again 
and that was her happiest moment
in the bookshop 
a very lonely job  yours 
sorry about the waders 
i don t feel in the least bit lonely 
that shelf over there
is a fifth of an inch crooked 
and that plastering 
it looks hideous 
you can let them know
the next time you see them 
no  no  it all looks wonderful  mr  raven 
i couldn t be happier with the work
the boys have done  honestly 
is that you  wally 
are your ears burning 
  what are you doing here  boy 
  i have a message for mrs  green 
  from whom 
  from mr  brundish  mr  raven 
what  
he just came out of holt house
and handed you a note 
no  he leaned out of the window and told me
to go and get this to mrs  green 
i don t see
how this can be for me 
i ve never spoken to mr  brundish   ever 
i can t believe he even knows my name 
and whenever i run into him on the headland 
he always goes off like a shot
as if he d just seen a ghost 
i m certain he knows
who you are 
he finds out about everything that happens
in town  i don t know how he does it 
don t you worry
about the envelopes  black edges 
he ordered those those envelopes back in 1919
when they were all returning from the first war and   
and mrs  brundish died   
during their honeymoon 
oh yes  how did she die 
she was drowned   
crossing the marshes 
she d gone to pick some blackberries
to bake a pie for mr  brundish 
 dear madam  
i would like to wish you well 
back in my great grandfather s day 
there was a bookseller in the high street 
who  if my memory serves me correctly 
knocked up one of his customers
with a desk pad
when he became annoying 
there d been some delay
in the arrival of the latest
installment of a new novel   i believe   
i believe it was dombey and son 
as of that day 
no one has plucked up courage enough
to sell books
in this forsaken corner of the world 
this is a great honour you do us 
i should undoubtedly visit your shop one day
if i ever went out 
but nowadays i rather make a point
of never doing this 
in spite of everything 
should you deem some literary novelty worthy
please  don t hesitate to send it to me 
in the case of biographies 
it s better  i find 
if they re about good people 
  whereas novels
are much more interesting
if they re about nasty people 
please have the same boy
who delivered this letter bring them to me
with a note  obviously 
indicating their price 
yours   
respectfully    
 edmund brundish  
my first customer 
come around later and
i ll give you a package for mr  brundish 
thank you  mrs  green 
you ll probably need a bright young helper
in the afternoon  in case it gets busy 
i was thinking of
one of the gipping girls 
mrs  gipping is more or less
up to date on the matter 
and i thought about asking her
which of her daughters might suit you the best 
i think the youngest  christine 
is the cleverest 
but she probably wouldn t give her out to you
for that precise reason 
  good afternoon  mr  thornton  welcome 
  thank you 
fahrenheit 451 
what kind of book is this 
you re christine gipping  aren t you 
i would have thought
your older sister would   
my elder sister
spends all her time with charlie cuts 
in fact  on my way over here 
i saw their bikes hidden under fallen leaves
over by the crossroads 
you won t have any trouble like that
with me  though 
those things aren t happening to me yet 
and i find boys to be repulsive 
and what about your other sister 
she spends all her time at home
minding margaret and peter 
they re the little ones 
you musn t think i don t want
to consider you for the job 
it s just that you don t
really look old enough 
or strong enough 
that s hard to say after a first glance 
you look old 
but you don t look strong 
it s all the same anyway 
we re all available 
but my older sister will be absent from work
half the time 
and the middle one won t show up 
just a warning 
and i should also let you know i don t like reading 
i like geography and maths 
i ll come round this afternoon
and discuss things with your mother 
and don t worry  i won t force you to read 
as you wish 
all she ll say is that i can
work every day after school
and all day saturday 
and you can t pay me less
than 12 shillings and six pence a week 
and to tell me to shut up
if i speak too much
what about your homework 
i can do that when i get home 
after tea 
i like your cardigan 
did you knit it yourself 
it looks like it would ve been very difficult 
it was in the magazine women s issue
but the instructions
were for short sleeves 
you have no children  mrs  green 
no 
should i have 
i don t know 
people always say life s passed by women
who have no children 
there aren t enough cards on display 
shall i put some more out 
they really should be ordered
into romance and nature or something 
  is this what you call romance 
  oh my god 
what are these 
i hadn t even seen them before 
those sales reps really don t know
what they re sending you 
we ve got to throw them away 
i m sure there s a few people in this village
who wouldn t mind getting these in their letterbox 
you re right 
stop looking at them 
you ll be corrupted 
  where is the bin 
  don t throw them in the bin 
come on  have a cup of tea 
why is christine so late 
she s been working for this lady 
why 
because he has a shop full of books
for people to read 
why 
i don t know 
good afternoon  mrs  gipping 
come in  mrs  green 
let s have a talk 
i m not sure if christine has already
spoken to you about the 12 shillings 
yes  yes  she did 
dear madam  spare yourself the trouble
of sending more books of poetry
or spuriously complicated novels 
please  at your earliest convenience 
send more books by ray bradbury 
yours respectfully 
edmund brundish 
very soon mrs  green s business
began to thrive 
her days were fully occupied
from morning to night 
for a short time she forgot about everything
concerning mrs  gamart
and her plans to turn the old house
into an art centre 
  good morning  mrs  green 
  hello  wally 
thanks you for doing me this favour 
here you are 
would you like to come
on an outing  christine 
i can t  we ve got new stock
arriving tomorrow 
okay then 
goodbye 
wouldn t you like
to go on an outing 
no  i like wally  but   
yes  i know  you did tell me
you find boys repulsive 
but believe me   
you ll get over it 
yes  i suppose 
it s just    i prefer to be here 
in the bookshop with you 
it s fun working here 
even if i don t like reading 
mrs  green  they re dirtying the cards 
just let them browse  it s part of
the tradition of a bookshop 
yes  but they leave everything in such a mess
and don t buy anything 
miss 
florence 
mr  north  what a surprise 
it seems violet
isn t going to get her own way 
  has she stopped by you yet 
  we haven t been open very long 
she will 
she ll appear eventually 
she has far too much self respect not to 
i m sure she is simply
dying of curiosity 
  she ll be quite welcome 
  are you making any money yet 
  not yet 
  you really need something like this 
this is volume one 
is there a volume two 
yes  but i have lent it to someone 
or left it somewhere 
you should keep them together
as a set 
lolita
have you read it  is it any good 
it will make you rich  florence 
yes  but is it good 
i only stock good novels 
they don t move fast  you know 
according to graham greene
it is a masterpiece 
although there are those
who think otherwise 
thank you for suggesting it 
i sometimes feel the need of good advice 
you re very kind 
you re always making that mistake 
until next time 
we have the blue one at home 
it has westminster abbey on it 
but it goes all the way around the tin 
i ll put the heat on 
mum says those paraffin heaters
aren t very safe 
they re not dangerous  as long as you
remember to clean them out properly 
and you don t pour the liquid in
from both sides at once 
you must never do that   ever 
do you hear me 
i like this old tray 
you can leave it to me in your will 
what  
i don t think i m ready
to start thinking about my will just yet 
but when i do 
i ll try to remember that 
you will 
are you sure 
is the tray from japan 
no  it s   
chinese lacquer 
my grandfather brought it back
from nanking 
he was a great traveller 
i don t think they even make lacquer
like this in china anymore 
thank you 
i was wondering if you d like me
to help you with your schoolwork or something 
  we could read things together maybe   
  there s nothing to read 
they give you some pictures and say
which one s the odd one out 
or they give you some numbers like   
8  5  11  9  22  and 16 
and you have to say
which one comes next 
i wouldn t begin to know
which one came next 
you re not cold  are you 
no 
that milo is a ferret 
he smiles just like a ferret 
i wish he d just go to hell 
stop it  christine 
you re too nice 
he s a nasty piece of work 
when i m older  i m going to try
to be like him 
it s much more practical 
i know you don t like reading 
but there s a book i m afraid
you must read 
what s it about 
it s about good pirates
and evil children 
promise me that you ll just at least
just open it one day 
well  if you ll let me have
the chinese tray in your will 
i can try 
deal 
dear mr  brundish 
enclosed you will find a copy of a novel
that has just been published  lolita 
i must confess
my bewilderment with it 
i d like to know your sincere opinion of it 
and ask for a bit of advice 
do you think it s a suitable book
to be sold in my bookshop 
yours sincerely 
florence green 
ps  if you don t like the book 
there s no need to pay for it 
hello  mrs  gipping  is everything alright 
i thought you should know
as soon as possible 
mr  brundish has asked me
to deliver my fruitcake on sunday 
and he s also asked me to ask you
if you d like to stop by the holt house
for tea that same afternoon 
this sunday 
why yes 
yes  yes  allright   
yes  i ll send him a note 
thank you for the message  mrs  gipping 
i ve never delivered a cake
to mr  brundish before 
i hope this doesn t
become a habit 
mrs  green  is it true you re having tea
at holt house this sunday 
yes  mrs  keble  it is true 
is there something i should know
before i go there 
mrs  green 
mrs  deben 
how is mr  deben 
still having trouble finding a buyer
for the fish shop  i gather 
poor thing 
i bet the general and mrs  gamart
are seething about the matter 
they ve never been invited
to holt house  you know 
yes  i ve heard 
so  holt house for tea  eh  
he so jealously guards his privacy
after the tragic death
of his beloved wife 
i sent him some books and   
asked for advice about the bookshop 
don t you know 
well  i should get back there 
i suppose 
  it s tipping down there 
  cats and dogs 
  good afternoon 
  good afternoon 
advice for the bookshop 
hello 
mr  brundish 
come into the dining room 
you asked me a question 
yes  i did it 
about a new novel 
you were thoughtful enough
to ask me a serious question 
thinking i would be impartial 
you undoubtedly thought
i was quite alone in the world 
never  i did not for one second   
i imagine you have been told
all kinds of things about me 
all bad 
no 
really 
i am a widower  i m sure you ve been told 
i imagine you ve also been told
that my wife died whilst gathering blackberries
to make me a pie 
which is the latetst version
going around town 
well   
none that have been circulating
are true 
  she didn t drown 
  no 
in the sixth month
of our marriage 
we both  
having been the best of friends  
decided that a friendly separation
would be for the best 
she lives in london 
i haven t seen her for 45 years 
but according to my information
she s still in very good health 
although  apparently   
she s put on quite a lot of weight 
she always loved sweets 
although i can never remember
her baking a cake in her life 
i suppose for people of hardborough
it s more picturesque
to imagine holt house
inhabited by a mourning widower 
as you already know 
literature has done a lot of damage 
those damned brontë sisters 
for example 
by whom you have not included
a single copy
in those packages to me 
for which i am ever so grateful 
i imagined
you would have read them already 
one of the gipping girls  the third one 
lends you a hand in your shop 
i believe 
and that is all the assistance
you have at your disposal 
i have a bookkeeper
who comes in from time to time 
and then there s my solicitor 
tom thornton 
you won t get very far with that one 
i can t say i m very fond
of mr  thornton 
you know  mr  brundish 
there is a certain responsibility
about trying to run a bookshop 
i magine there is 
especially if not everyone approves of it 
there are certain people
who are rather put up
by your bookshop 
mrs  green  i refer to violet gamart 
who had other plans
for the old house 
and who now  it seems 
has taken further offenses only 
i m sure that she   
means well 
means well  violet gamart  
that harpy 
what she wants isn t   
arts centre 
now  i ask you  what the hell does
this damn village need with an arts centre 
and how could art have a center 
but she s got it into her head that it does 
and that s the reason she wants to get rid of you 
and she won t stop   
until she does 
she can t do that 
it s my bookshop  it s my home 
people like violet gamart
have made me what i am  mrs  green 
thanks to her connections and acquaintances 
mrs  gamart is a very powerful woman 
does that not concern you 
no 
may i get back
to the reason for my visit 
i m thinking of making
a first order of lolita
of 250 copies 
which would be a considerable risk 
of course  i m not consulting you in a
business sense  that would be quite wrong 
all i want to know 
before i put in the order 
is whether you think it s a good book
and whether you that it is right
that i should sell it in hardborough 
i do not attach as much importance
as you do  i dare say 
to the notions of right and wrong 
i have read lolita 
as you asked me to 
it is a good book 
and therefore i think you should try
and sell it to the people of hardborough 
they won t understand it 
but that s all for the best 
understanding makes the mind lazy 
thank you 
thank you  mr  brundish 
well  i have given you my opinion 
let me tell you
what it is i admire
about human beings 
what i value most
it is the one virtue they share
with gods and animals 
and which i will therefore no longer
refer to as a virtue 
i mean   
courage 
and you  mrs  green   
possess that quality in abundance 
i would like   
i would like to help 
you make me believe    
once more  in things   
things i thought forgotten 
thank you for the tea  mr  brundish 
everything was delicious 
well  please   
come again when you wish 
and good luck with lolita 
yes  thank you  
i musn t let myself worry 
 where there is life  there is hope  
god  what a horrifying thought 
yes 
thank you   
for your advice  mr  brundish 
my pleasure 
do you think dandelion wine
will be coming soon 
i must say i can t thank you enough
for introducing me to ray bradbury 
we ll have wally bring it round 
or  maybe  i ll bring it    
to you 
well   
i would like that very much 
we ve never had so many
of the same one before 
such a long one 
this book is already famous  christine 
everybody s heard of it 
though i don t suppose they ever expected
they d be able to buy it here in hardborough 
what they won t expect
is to find 250 copies 
you ve really lost your head
over this one 
the novel
that is shocking the world
 september 4  1959  
 dear mrs  green  
i have in my possession
a letter from john drury   co  
legal representative
of mrs  violet gamart of the stead 
to the effect
that the current state of your window display
is attracting rather undesirable attention
from both potential and actual customers 
their client likewise assures
that she feels personally affronted
by the fact that she 
in her position as justice of the peace
and chairman of numerous committees
 list enclosed herewith  
must carry out her shopping expeditiously 
dear mr  thornton 
you have been my solicitor now for several years 
which allows me to infer that  acting for me 
means  acting energetically on my behalf  
have you even seen the window display
for yourself 
 dear mrs  green 
in response to your missive
september 5 
i have attempted on two occasions
to approach your shop window 
but found it impossible  
  understood 
  yes  mrs  green 
 dear mr  thornton 
what exactly is your advice then 
yours truly  florence green  
 i think we should eliminate
the agglomerations 
stop your customers from assembling
in the narrowest part of the high street 
before any formal complaint is made 
and i also think
we should put an end
to the sale of this banal and sensationalistic
novel by v  nabokov 
that has given rise to so many complaints  
 dear mr  thornton 
a good book is the precious distillation
of a master spirit
embalmed and preserved for the purpose
of achieving a life beyond life 
which is why it is  undoubtedly 
a necessary commodity 
yours sincerely  florence green   
 dear madam 
with regard to your request
for an express prohibition
concerning mrs  florence green   
we regret to inform you
we regret to inform you that 
after having been duly advised 
it would be best
to drop this matter 
as the reported crowd seem
to have been curbed by the local police 
my deepest  deepest apologies 
mrs  gamart   
why won t you come to london 
i can t think of anything worse
than living in london 
you know how i feel about people 
look at this  look at this 
this is absolutely stunning 
i m not staying here 
what do you mean you re not staying 
where are you going 
oh for goodness sake  you have to
just keep storming off   
i ve told you   
i m sick of people like violet 
  what 
  i can t take it anymore  milo 
wait  just be careful 
otherwise you re going to slip 
hold on  wait 
what on earth are you doing
sitting there  florence 
i do not know why i go for walks 
it looks like a pensioner 
  and i should get to work 
  is there room on that step for me 
  yes 
  i m kattie  mrs  green 
milo has told me so much about you 
kattie wouldn t believe there were
any nice spots in hardborough 
so i brought her out here
to see for herself 
and what is is
that you do at the bbc  kattie 
i work for the rpd 
recorded programmes department 
monitoring expenses   
it s not exactly exciting 
we ve just been for lunch
with violet gamart 
gave her a chance
to not disapprove of us 
mrs  gamart is very kind 
well  not really 
i don t like kind people 
except for florence 
don t flatter me 
i get the feeling
you work less and less every day 
don t forget the bbc
is a corporation 
and your salary is paid for
with public funding 
kattie deals with that 
she s in charge of my expenses sheet 
are not you cold  my darling 
perhaps this time we ought to
quibble off back to our humble abode 
and leave florence alone 
lost in her thoughts 
i think i ll stay here a little longer 
  as long as i m not bothering you 
  no  not at all 
milo told me you re a widow 
yes  yes  i am 
 a widow  
such a strange  dark word 
don t you think 
my husband died   
16 years ago 
how did you meet 
we met in a bookshop actually 
in london 
we were in love from the first moment 
we had to organize the   
organize and classify
the poetry section together at muller s 
he used to read aloud to me
every night 
pepys  and george eliot  and thackeray   
 never give a lady a restive horse  
we loved that one 
we were very happy   
busy doing a million things
and nothing 
and then the war came 
but i still have his letters 
all his letters  and i   
i can still   
hear his voice in my head
when i read them 
milo didn t do you justice
when he described you to me 
oh dear  spare me from milo s appraisal 
i don t think i want to know
what he thinks of me 
i still don t know
what he thinks of me 
or if he feels something for me 
or  for that matter 
if he feels anything at all 
i guess that s part
of his thing   
keeping you guessing all the time 
you know what they say 
 with that kind of man you never know
whether he s hiding a rich inner world or   
absolutely nothing  
he ll never read aloud to me 
aunt vi 
so  your bill is already having
its third reading  excellent 
and i have you to thank
for all your inspiration  aunt vi 
whatever do you mean 
the idea came to me during your party
last spring 
your wonderful campaign
in favour of an arts centre
could become a reality
with a bill like this 
and other communities
could benefit as well from   
philanthropists such as yourself 
well  i ve only done
what i felt was right 
the access to places of public value bill
will make sure the town councils
can acquire their historic properties
by compulsory purchase
for public use 
isn t it wonderful 
i m sure your father is smiling down on us
from heaven with great pride at this very moment 
and i m just so glad we arranged
to meet today of all days 
precisely when the bill
has been approved 
do you fancy fish for lunch 
i know a wonderful place
around the corner 
i m afraid living in hardborough
puts you off eating fish anywhere else 
it s so fresh down there 
so true 
a spot of tea then 
perfect 
then i shall continue
with what i was doing 
i have a sick friend
who needs my attention 
you re such a wonderful 
generous woman  aunt vi 
carry on with your work 
heads down 
eyes down 
on with your work 
no need to get up  children 
i m the inspector 
no  you re not 
i m sorry 
i don t think i know you 
mrs  traill 
my name is sheppard 
if you d be so kind  you may examine my
certificate from the ministry of education authority 
it authorizes me 
under the shops act of 1950 
to visit any school
where i have cause to believe
that there are children studying
who also engage in some sort of work 
work   i can assure you
they d all love to have a job 
outside of family businesses
and newspaper deliveries 
you tell me what else
awaits them out there 
and by the way   
i don t remember you
ever visiting here before 
well  due to staff shortages 
our visits are not quite as frequent
as we would like them to be 
so  who suggested
you come this time 
there is only one
who has a steady job after school 
christine gipping
who works regularly 
where 
the old house bookshop 
stand up  christine 
if you ll excuse me 
  this is the girl 
  miss  would you mind coming with me 
  good day 
  good day 
i don t want you to think
i hold anything against you 
the law is the law 
that s something i came to say 
experience is important 
the job also says they want her to have experience 
but where can we get it 
but we always tell christine
that if she needs references 
she only has to come to you 
yes  of course 
all she has to do is ask 
christine is a wonderful girl 
mrs  gipping  and   
i m very  very fond of her 
but now she ll have an opportunity
to concentrate on her studies 
but she doesn t want
to give up earning money 
no  of course not  but i suppose
after what happened at the school   
well  we ve been looking round a bit 
and we hope they ll be hiring her
to work saturdays at that new bookshop 
new bookshop 
yes  they will open very soon 
you know  in deben s 
the fish shop 
i had no idea 
you really must keep an eye
on the competition  mrs  green 
you will give christine those references 
won t you 
she had no way of knowing this 
but the new bookshop
was not an enterprise like her own 
but an investment
by the simple minded lord gosfield
on the advice of the general
and mrs  gamart 
  thank you for coming  mrs  green 
  no need to thank me  mr  keble 
do you realize how very little
working capital you have at the moment 
yes  it s rather difficult
not to notice 
i daresay things have taken quite a dip
in your business of late  haven t they 
i thought you might like to know
there s a possible buyer for your shop 
thank you very much 
mr  keble   
the shop is not for sale 
message received 
thank you for coming 
it has been an incalculable help 
well   
i really shall miss you 
i don t want to go  you know 
i don t want to work
in that other bookshop 
my mother  she simply doesn t understand   
no  please 
you musn t worry about that 
how can i not worry 
you can t manage this place by yourself 
and no one in this village
will help you 
i shall manage  i absolutely   
i shall manage 
i do hope you ll come by 
from time to time  in the evenings   
i won t have the time 
yes  no 
no  of course you ll be busy 
i ve got something for you 
now you won t have to wait
until my funeral 
you re so kind  mrs  green 
you re so bloody kind 
good afternoon  florence 
mrs  green 
mr  brundish 
how are things coming along
down there 
i think you know
as well as i do  don t you 
i do know some of it 
what do you intend to do 
do 
the only thing i can do 
yes 
no 
carry on 
that s what i was going to do 
florence   
i would very much like
to have met you at another time in my life 
in another life altogether 
but i m going to do what   
small thing is in my power
to help you 
mr  brundish  it s    
it s very warming to hear  and   
i so appreciate it 
you musn t   
there is nothing you   
i will have a word with her 
i will talk to that woman 
she might just listen  she might   
put an end to this loathesome harrassment 
you d really do that 
really 
come out of your seclusion for me 
indeed i will 
i don t know that it should be of much use 
but i m willing 
i could just put
a bullet through her  but   
i m not sure
that would be to your liking 
i don t know
how to ever thank you  that s   
that s the most   
noble gesture
anyone has ever made for me 
you work too hard  florence 
i try to concentrate 
please put those down  they ve only
just come in  i haven t checked them yet 
surely you have to succeed
if you give everything you have 
i can t see why 
everyone gives everything they have
eventually 
we all die 
dying is hardly a success 
too young to bother about dying 
i believe kattie might snuff it  
  she wastes so much energy 
  how is kattie 
no idea 
as a matter of fact 
she s left me 
she s    well  she s gone to live
with someone else 
in wantage 
she s    you know   
he works in the world service 
i m opening my heart to you 
we re having a special moment 
aren t we 
i expect you have told everyone
in hardborough who ll listen to you 
yes  but it affects you particularly
because i ll have so much more
free time as of now 
i ll be able to work here 
part time  as your assistant 
i guess you must miss
that little girl 
christine learned a great deal
when she was here 
and he was extremely nice
with the customers 
not as nice as i can be 
so   
how much can you pay me 
i gave christine 12 shillings
and 6 pence a week 
i won t be able to offer any more
than that at the moment 
if you are interested in the job 
you may come by in the afternoons
for a few weeks and try it out 
trial period 
but please remember i didn t offer
you the job  you asked yourself 
has anyone ever told you
you have a marvellous pair of ankles 
oh  do shut up 
go home 
open
closed
 shower down thy love  o burning bright 
for one night or the other night
will come the gardener in white
and gathered flowers are dead  
christine 
you d better watch out  mr  north 
what unpleasant expressions
they teach you in that school 
i didn t come her to see people of   
your sort 
why    
why are you not helping ms  green anymore 
she misses you 
she s got you  hasn t she 
you re always in and out 
they say they won t
let her keep the bookshop 
  they say  who say  you say 
  you know very well who 
  they have other plans for the old house 
  why do you even care  you little shrimp 
they say she can t keep it 
she ll go after her 
she ll take her to court 
she ll just swear to tell the truth 
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth 
well  we must hope
that it doesn t come to that 
i never had the time to sit around
when i was her assistant 
no wonder 
you re a child   
or a woman 
neither of them have any idea
of how to relax 
you d just better watch out 
i ve come to get this 
it belongs to my mum 
thank you 
give me a moment 
what a pleasant surprise 
mr  brundish 
please  have a seat 
thank you 
i have come to ask you something 
i don t know if
if this is the proper way to do so 
but i can t think of a better one 
if you are not in the mood for questions 
you should say so now 
would you like some tea 
i don t want your tea 
i want you to leave florence green alone 
  did she ask you to come and see me 
  certainly not 
she is simply a woman
who wants to keep a bookshop 
if ms  green has reason to complain 
i suppose we should turn to a solicitor 
though i believe she s rather given
to changing her legal advice 
the bookstore is drafty 
impossible to mortgage a second time 
and from what i ve heard  damp 
leave her alone 
the woman has done nothing to you 
has is not occured to you 
as someone who must be extremely concerned
about the welfare
and future of this place 
that a building of such historical interest
could be put to a better use 
old age is not the same thing
as historical interest 
otherwise you and i would be
far more interesting than we are 
i repeat  i want you to leave my friend
florence green alone 
alone 
well  it appears your friend has failed
to take the law into consideration 
something which i ve observed
on several occasions 
if that is the case 
i can have nothing to say in the matter 
the law will have
to take its course 
are you referring to a law
that didn t exist a year ago
and that parliament approved
behind our backs 
i m talking about an order
for compulsory purchase 
or an eviction 
which is the proper term 
did you put your precious nephew
up to drafting that bill 
i won t deny my nephew s bill
may affect the bookshop 
as it is essential the premises
must have remained empty for five years 
that would undoubtedly apply
to the old house 
but there are so many regulations
to be considered  mr  brundish 
ordinary mortals like myself
and of course like you
would hardly know where to begin 
i am in politics 
and  subsequently 
i m fairly familiar with bureaucracy 
but this goes way beyond me 
we wouldn t even know
how to find the right person to write to 
madam  i know perfectly well
who to write to 
over the past years 
if i d not made it my business to know 
i would have lost
several hundred acres of marshes 
and farming land  and two pumping mills 
that s why i m certain
that if nothing has been done so far 
we can still form
a common front against them 
we can certainly think of ways
of making the move easier
if it is actually made 
there are still plenty
of other places to let
in larger towns than hardborough 
that s not what i m talking about 
you should be talking about
what i m talking about 
i wish i could do something more 
i assume then
that you intend to do nothing 
you mustn t speak to me
that way  mr  brundish 
you don t realize
what you are saying 
you seem to think
i m an outrageous person 
is that it 
i can t answer that question
 yes  or  no  
i suspect that by  outrageous 
you mean  unexpectedly offensive  
and the truth is
you have been fairly offensive  but also   
repulsive  mrs  gamart 
that is  you have behaved
exactly as i expected 
good afternoon  general 
you wouldn t like a book 
would you 
not exactly 
i just came to say 
 a good man has left us  
i believe you knew edmund brundish
quite well  did you not 
i feel as though i did 
i never crossed words
with him at all 
he was in the first mess  of course   
but not in the suffolks 
he signed up for the air force 
i believe 
he wanted to fly 
how odd 
it was also odd that he came
to see us that very morning 
i wanted to speak to your wife 
i imagine 
yes  you re quite right 
violet told me all about it 
he made a great effort to go see her   
to congratulate her on her idea 
i m referring to the arts centre 
i m sorry i didn t get a chance
to speak to him 
i must say i would
never have imagined him
being interested in art 
but well   
a good man has left us 
anyone could suffer an attack like that
if you think about it 
you musn t be late
to your lunch party  general 
leave my house
and don t ever come back 
and please   
don t you or your wife
ever again malign
a man who had more dignity   
sensitivity   
and compassion than either of you
will have in your time 
don t ever say his name again 
and forget mine 
but she   
violet   
leave 
so it seems i have been evicted
by the city of flintmarket 
as we mentioned
during our last phone conversation 
it seems there s a new parliament bill
which allows flintmarket council
to take over ownership of the old house 
yes 
and i should like to know 
if i may 
where the council obtained the funds
necessary to throw me out 
they apparently found a benefactor 
what concerns me is if the old house
is considered to be habitable or not 
if it turns out that it is unfit
for human habitation 
or indeed subsidence is threatened 
then it will be impossible to demand compensation 
you won t see a penny 
i m inhabiting it
and i m still human 
it s not even as damp
as all that 
in the summer
it s really quite dry and in mid winter   
here is an inspection of the cellars 
according to which the property
is standing in half an inch of water 
sorry  what inspection 
i wasn t informed of any inspection 
i don t think 
apparently  on several occasions 
when you were absent from the property 
an expert in masonry and plastering 
a mr  john gipping 
was sent by the council
to inspect the condition
of the walls and the cellars 
john gipping  christine s father 
we assume he entered peaceably 
i don t remember letting him in myself 
your assistant  mr  milo north   
everyone assumed
he acted as your servant
and was following your instructions 
have you any comments 
what leaves us
in a difficult position
is the fact that mr  north
has also signed a statement 
according to which the level of dampness
in the property has affected his health 
making him unable to accept
any type of ordinary employment 
why 
there is no why 
they asked me persistently 
so you know   
i simply thought i d better do it 
if you re looking for a new assistant 
i believe christine is available 
she s no longer working
at the new bookshop 
she tried to sell lolita
to the vicar 
florence 
mrs  green  mrs  green 
  christine 
  mrs  green 
mrs  green 
goodbye 
for years to come 
i will remember how she tried to smile
looking at the book i had in my hands 
then  she realized
what i had done 
she had fulfilled the dream 
and they d snatched it
away from her 
but what she possessed deep down
was something no one could ever
take away from her 
her courage 
and it was that courage
and her passion for books
that she bequeathed to me 
along with the chinese lacquered tray
