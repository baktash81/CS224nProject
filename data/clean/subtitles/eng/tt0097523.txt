okay  see  i was playing
with my ball  right 
well    well  actually 
it s not my ball exactly 
  it s charlie sudzen s 
  just tell her what you did 
it never would ve happened
if their house wasn t so close 
  he hit a baseball
through your attic window 
  he what 
it shouldn t have been closed
in the first place  it s a nice day 
  we ll get it fixed  okay  we ll take

  how do you know 
  well   
  you could see me 
  no 
uh  no  l    yeah  i could 
but i wasn t watching you  l   
awesome 
so your dad s still in contact
with his home planet 
and given that my machine can
substantially reduce   
the size of bulky payloads
and fuel supplies   
the savings to the space program
would be staggering 
mr  szalinski  are you
trying to tell me that   
suddenly size is
no longer relative 
well  that s right  professor
frederickson  that all matter is   
made up of not only density 
but of empty space 
and if we can proportionally reduce
the amount of empty space   
in any given object  we can
thereby shrink the object 
uh huh  where s your proof 
when einstein came up with
the atomic bomb  did they ask
him to prove that it worked 
you  mr  szalinski 
are hardly einstein 
  i picked a name 
  you have  however 
managed to shrink one thing   
the size of this audience 
gentlemen  ladies  i don t know
about you  but i m going to lunch 
wayne  wayne 
  oh  uh  hi  dr  maynard 
  don t take it too hard  wayne 
it will take time to convince
people without proof 
i appreciate it

i m sure it s nothing to worry about 
this sort of thing happens all the time 
  you have a little spat with the kids   
  whoa  we did not have a spat 
  you were kind of upset
about russ quitting the team  hon

hey  hey  maybe we can use this 
cool  now we can
see in the dark 
hey  antie  look 
headlights 
  i didn t force him to join the team 
  i know

a big deal out of sports 
  because sports build character 
  no  they don t  they build muscle 
russell  you ve got to understand 
these kids aren t   
  wayne 
  yeah 
we ve got to tell the thompsons 
what do you take me for 
a complete idiot 
  how did this happen 
  hold on a second  mae 
i ll handle it  all right 
how did this happen 
well  the machine analyzes the
molecular structure of each compound   
  and then through laser inversion 
it takes all the   
  wait  wayne  wait 
i think the thompsons
need to see the couch 
this guy is a waste of skin 
  this is a microscope 
  i know 
look in there 
all right 
you see  that s the couch that
used to be sitting right over here 
until the machine shrunk it 
all right  so there s
some doll furniture  big deal 
they sell that kind of stuff
at swap meets 
why didn t you tell us earlier 
well  until now 
the machine just blew things up 
  are you saying that that machine   
  blew up my kids 
  no  no  no  no 
  oh  no  no  no 
  if the machine had blown up the kids 
there d be piece of them everywhere 
  wayne

  the machine shrunk our kids 
  you re the one
who needs a shrink  szalinski 
  russ 
  you are a nutcase 
and i ll tell you something 
i have got an air hammer
in my attic   
and if you did do something to my kids 
there s gonna be pieces of you
all over the neighborhood

i think we should
have them over more often 
yeah  well 
it s a priority for me 
now  why don t you do
what you re paid to do 
find my kids 
i thought you didn t believe him 
oh  i don t
