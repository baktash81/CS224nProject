and  somehow  nobody seems
to notice that he is completely naked 
wolverine  a mutant
with superhuman strength
who can heal himself
and take down any villain 
he just shouldn t pick his nose 
and incandesto  my dad s perfect creation 
he can shine
with the light of a thousand suns
and rescue any soul
from the darkness of despair 
however different they are 
all superheroes come to us with a purpose 
to save those in need 
to stand watch when danger closes in 
but they have one thing in common 
they never show up in the real world 
oh  boy  what now  flora 
they re in mint condition 
i keep them in protective sleeves
and try not to breathe when reading them 
sellin  your whole collection 
if you ask me 
great art belongs to the world 
i didn t   cause i own a comic book store 
and you re eight 
  ten 
  what  inches tall 
look  i can take these
to the store down the street 
yeah  all right 
let s see here  what do we got 
wait 
not that one 
all right  i ll give you
30 bucks for everything 
  thirty  you barely even looked at them 
  yeah  because i got a tournament to host 
you think these guys
have been sittin  here for 16 hours
so that i can sit here
talkin  to flora the explorer 
some of these are worth that alone 
can you just go back through them 
  i ll wait 
  i know you will 
hey  watch it  oh  hey    oh  come on 
epic fail 
uh   
thirty sounds good 
yeah  30 sounds great 
some would still believe
life is a comic book
filled with wonder 
where miraculous things happen 
where families stay together 
but i am a cynic 
and a cynic knows
that superheroes are only in your head 
looks like fun 
not for me 
i ve more serious matters to attend to 
oh  right  me  too 
the righteous never rest 
the danger is what s real 
heads up 
that girl just ate it 
not that
it s easy to let go of hope 
flora  are you reading
the books i bought you 
yep 
remember our contract 
cynics live in defiance of contracts 
what  cynics invented contracts 
  see  so much better than comic books 
  mmm hmm 
come downstairs 
i wanna show you something 
so what do you think
about the new addition 
nothing in here looks new 
old is the new new 
i keep telling you that 
i thought you were talking about being 40 
i m 36 
  sure 
  so what do you think 
about you being 36  skeptical 
about this 
wow  you replaced
your computer with a typewriter 
yeah 
it s gonna be hard to get on the internet 
exactly  that s the whole point 
my next novel is set in the 1920s 
so this is gonna get me
to tap into the language 
except for the  j  key 
 cause the  j  key doesn t work 
my mother is a romance novelist 
she said her books
were about superheroes too 
but their superpower was something
i wasn t old enough to know about yet 
she wrote about love because she had love 
we all did 
but ever since dad moved out 
she couldn t write anything 
i think maybe dad was her  j  key 
you know what  i ll just write in the  j  
heel  heel  heel 
  heel  oh  no 
  searching 
help  help 
runaway vacuum  stop 
  bad robot  stop 
  searching 
holy bagumba 
i know  it s good  right 
sit  you sit 
no  it s terrible 
boundary  boundary 
  i can help 
  helping 
you got nowhere to go 
you re surrounded by boundaries 
evolving 
  it s evolving 
  i got it 
evolving 
  come on 
  evolving 
i got it  i got it  no  i don t 
archie  look out 
trash 
  trash  trash 
  no 
oh 
canister full 
no   
if you re wondering
how a squirrel s mouth tastes 
it s exactly how you d think 
fuzzy  damp  and slightly nutty 
but incandesto fights for the weak 
no matter how they taste 
and so would i 
come on  breathe 
hello 
why s he staring at us 
maybe he s wondering
why we re staring at him 
because he was just dead 
tootie 
did you turn on the ulysses 
i spilled my froot loops again 
ulysses 
my dad drew heroes
with powers you couldn t always see
until you needed help and realized
they were the only ones there 
like the mighty condor 
shobo the homeless warrior 
and  of course  the amazing incandesto 
they all had power and
purpose and courage 
but when my dad couldn t
get any of them published 
he lost his 
and even though my mom tried
to help him get his courage back 
there was nobody who could save him 
hey  maybe the mighty condor
needs to be more hero y 
how  bout a cape 
who am i kidding  i can t keep doin  this 
george 
capes could pay the mortgage 
there was nobody
who could save him 
and nobody who could save us 
most kids would ve hoped
for things to work out differently 
but cynics don t hope 
they see what s real 
you have to stay in here  okay 
if my mom finds you  she might think
you re a rat and hit you with a pan 
that s how i lost my hamster 
  flora 
  i m coming 
ladies and gentlemen 
fax machines  calculators 
and all other outdated
technology is now 50   off 
outdated technology  50   off 
pause 
hey  chad 
quick thing  i m gonna put on
my manager hat here for just one second 
i m gonna need you to push
those extended warranties on the printers 
i always offer it to people 
but they ask if the printers break 
and they usually don t 
i m gonna fast forward this
to the end here 
sell the warranties 
yeah  i understand
the selling warranties part 
i don t quite understand
how you re controlling time
  with an invisible remote 
  excuse me  sir 
you helped me so much
the last time i was here 
  i remember 
  i was wondering if   
i know you re his daughter 
oh   
back to work 
is everything okay 
  yeah  i saved a squirrel 
  what 
do you remember how they explained
infant cpr
in terrible things can happen to you 
chapter 12  grave mistakes 
exactly  i just pretended
the squirrel was a furry little baby 
and it worked 
i named him ulysses  this is for him 
did you put your mouth on the squirrel 
  i had to 
  was he clean 
probably not 
probably not or definitely not 
  definitely not  but i had to 
  correct  right 
can i just take these 
i ll take care of it 
employees get 3   off 
  nice 
  yeah  it s way better than healthcare 
so  i found a new publisher 
they mostly do online stuff 
but i think incandesto
would be better on a computer 
 cause he can light up 
you know  don t worry about it  okay 
i could submit it for you 
i just don t think
the world is ready for incandesto 
  this thing broken 
  no  it s functioning 
 kay  i ll see you tomorrow   kay 
  okay 
  okay 
what s another word for  steamy  
i ve already used that three times 
juicy 
yeah  that s good 
what s another one 
joyful 
ha ha  very funny 
 steamy    
i saw dad 
yeah 
he s really letting the beard go 
like the guy in electric love 
will you point the jack and rose at me 
i    i need their strength 
the jack and rose 
it was a prestigious award
from romantic living magazine 
because nothing says
 living  like the titanic 
ulysses  you have to be careful 
a body can only take so much trauma 
unless you re incandesto s alter ego 
alfred t  slipper 
his trauma gave him power 
he was once an unassuming janitor
until he fell into a vat
of industrial cleaning solution 
then he transformed 
hey  you got sucked up by a vacuum 
maybe you re a superhero 
nah  you re just a nice squirrel 
flora belle 
can you come down for dinner 
it s from the microwave 
but i made it look
like it s from the oven 
i m turning the oven on  so it feels real 
all right  mom 
be right down 
want me to microwave the rolls 
so they re fresh from the oven 
okay  i have to go  i m gonna try
and bring you up some more food 
i can t promise you it ll be good
because i know it won t be 
saving some for later  looks so good 
so  i have some big news 
the herald is doing
a piece on my next book 
wow 
yeah  in publishing 
they call that  trending  
people still read the newspaper 
yes  you should  too 
it s not in my contract 
you live in defiance of contracts 
right 
hey  do you wanna go to the mall tomorrow 
we can get our hair done
at that place where they act all snooty 
even though they re right
next to the food court 
no  i m good 
flora  you can t spend
another summer alone 
you need friends 
do you have friends 
i m an artist  i suffer for my art 
the ghost babies were weird 
mmm hmm 
flora 
what is this 
your typewriter 
i know it s my typewriter 
i mean the paper in it 
 squirtel 
 i am ulysses  born anew  
holy unanticipated occurrences 
flora  this isn t a joke 
this typewriter is for my work 
but i didn t   
and my cheese balls  the whole bag  god 
now i can t eat my way out of sadness 
unless i wanna lick
the cheese off the keys 
which  honestly  i m considering doing 
god  think about that  how sad that is 
that is really sad 
  can i keep this 
  no  i m gonna publish it 
did you type this 
 do not hope  observe  
terrible things can happen to you
made it very clear that hope
can get in the way of action 
a true cynic has no luxury for hope 
only observation 
ulysses  can you understand me 
holy bagumba 
can you talk 
okay  that s not really talking 
but still 
i knew it 
the vacuum made you a superhero 
it sucked up an unassuming squirrel
and spit out a ulysses 
i m so glad i saved these
for an emergency 
though  i told mom i d use them
to line the cage when i got a new hamster 
now  the important thing
is to find your purpose 
every superhero has
one true and unwavering purpose 
usually it s liberty or freedom 
but it can also be revenge 
which is darker 
and you have to kill people 
and then regret it afterwards 
usually by screaming at the sky 
do you have any enemies 
don t worry  it s usually a person 
or a monster 
or a monster that started as a person 
superheroes can handle anything 
i can be your sidekick 
incandesto has a parakeet named dolores 
but you can have me 
i will help you find your purpose 
flora  i think your dad is here 
don t worry  dad is one of us 
i wanna lick these keys 
hello 
mrs  tickham 
and some tootie turnovers 
hello  friendly neighbor here 
tootie  what a nice surprise 
well  the world is full
of lots o  surprises these days 
william 
sorry  so many wonderful smells outside 
jasmine  i think 
we don t have any jasmine 
it could be up to a mile away 
this is my nephew  william spiver 
he s spending the summer with us 
pleased to meet you both 
well  i assume there are two of you 
although  there could be
a third who hasn t talked 
a baby  perhaps 
i think i smell a baby 
there s no baby 
could be up to a mile away 
william is suffering
from temporary blindness 
it s caused by stress 
hysterical blindness  actually 
i ve read about that
in terrible things can happen to you 
it s supposed to go away if you relax 
squirrel 
there s a squirrel in here 
where s my tennis racket 
i can get a clean shot 
  what 
  gah  come with me 
ah  yes  i m getting him now 
ulysses  you have to be more careful 
danger lurks everywhere 
especially where there s tennis rackets 
are you talking to that squirrel 
go away  you re trespassing 
it s only trespassing if a sign is posted
with letters measuring
no less than two inches in height 
yep  there s one right here 
if you don t mind 
i have important things to do 
well  i don t have anything to do 
so  maybe i could be of assistance 
do you mind if i feel your face 
so i know what you look like 
i guess 
hmm  hmm  hmm 
doesn t really work 
just feels like a face 
are your hands clean 
what happened to make you blind 
why re you talking to a squirrel 
he s a superhero 
what 
 i    
it s just one letter 
 l  o  v    
uh  okay  he s going squirrel speed now 
 i love your round head 
 the brilliant green  the sky so new 
 these letters  this world  you 
 i am very  very hungry  
i told you  he types poetry 
not great poetry  though 
he s a squirrel 
fine  he s a poetry typing squirrel 
do you doubt him 
of course i doubt him 
what kind of superhero types poetry 
my dad s here  he ll know what to do 
find your way out  william 
you don t have to ring the bell 
  but you do have to fix it 
  but i don t live here anymore 
  which thing are you responding to 
  ringing it 
so  you ll fix it 
oh  i did fix it 
that s why it sounds that way 
  hi  oh 
  hi 
so  i was gonna give you a hug 
yeah  just like an adult hug 
  yeah 
  great 
where s flora 
well  she ran off with a squirrel 
hi  dad  i just gotta run upstairs 
   kay 
  what s under your sweatshirt 
  nothing 
  it s moving 
i m pregnant 
  is it the squirrel 
  yes 
flora  flora 
did you see that 
she s totally ignoring me 
she s never done that before 
i m afraid it s drugs 
she s ten 
will you just please help her 
i really need to focus on my book 
we need the income 
i can t pay the mortgage
with your paperclip commissions 
oh  we don t get commissions 
yeah  it s a metaphor 
i don t think that s a metaphor 
okay  you know what  i m a novelist 
  i know what a metaphor is 
  right 
will you just put the squirrel in that
and just get rid of it 
he s probably diseased  honey 
squirrels are the most diseased
of any rodent 
i think that s rats 
i wrote all of these books 
george  all of them 
mmm hmm 
i guess
we need to find another yard 
yeah 
he s not just a squirrel  dad 
he s got powers 
he s been transformed
like alfred t  slipper 
okay 
that s it 
that s what 
this squirrel is a superhero 
the universe sent him for a reason 
stop it  stop it 
he s just exploring his powers 
all superheroes do 
flora  i used to think
that life was a comic book  too 
full of magic and wonder  but it s not 
there is no magic 
we just want there to be
so the world doesn t feel so hopeless 
but incandesto says   
incandesto s a drawing  honey 
all superheroes are 
our lives used to be full of magic 
are you getting divorced 
no  we re just tryin 
to figure things out 
yeah 
hey  who s hungry 
oh  donuts 
you know  i don t think you re supposed
to bring a squirrel to a restaurant 
unless it s like a seeing eye squirrel
or something like that 
he ll stay in the box 
  he s trained 
  he s a superhero 
  right 
  hi  i m rita  you ready to order 
i m not hungry 
okay  well  i am  i m starving 
i will have an omelet   
i ll have a donut 
  one donut 
  i will have an   
  two donuts 
  two donuts 
two donuts 
  i ll have an omelet  please  with   
  uh  three donuts 
  i d like an omelet  please  with bacon   
  six donuts  please 
is your mom feeding you 
hey  what do you have in there 
is it a little kitty or something 
no  it s just a box 
come on  just a little kitty  right 
can i just   
i just wanna see the little fuzzball 
is it cute 
  here  kitty   
  no 
there s always that moment
in any origin story
where the hero awakens 
embraces his identity 
and unleashes the full breadth of his   
that moment was not now 
not another infestation 
ulysses  forget the donuts 
squirrel  aah  get it off 
just stay calm  he s friendly 
squirrel  squirrel 
look out 
ulysses  no 
remember who you are  ulysses 
is he   
he is 
oh   
  flora  flora  hey  hey  hey 
  ulysses  get out of there 
ulysses 
no  no  get back 
we should leave 
yup 
here we go 
holy bagumba 
holy  holy bagumba  he flew 
yes  across the whole restaurant 
  yes 
  i told you he s a superhero 
and he s not floating  he s actually   
  he s flying 
  he s picking a destination
  and he s landing there 
  yes 
all right  because i have
a light bulb in my apartment
that i can t quite get 
 cause it s too high 
do you think he can twist it out 
  yeah 
  okay 
i have always wanted to fly like that 
oh  boy 
is he okay 
i think he might need a doctor 
okay  there s a doctor in apartment six 
we had to find a place
to keep ulysses safe 
dad s apartment
wasn t a typical superhero lair 
since it wasn t built into a mountain
or in a frozen tundra
where your ghost father gave you advice 
but it did have a pool 
i think he might have a concussion 
keep your voice down  it s watching us 
it also has a psychotic cat
named mr  klaus 
very slowly 
here we go  here we go 
here we go  here we go  we re safe 
go  go  go  go  go 
go  go  go  go  go  go 
go  go  go  go  go  go 
dad  hurry  come on 
i can t get it to work 
go  go  go  go  go  go 
get in  get in  get in 
okay  we survived 
what was wrong with that thing 
i don t think cats like to be groomed 
they re self groomers  you take
that away from  em  they got nothin  
  it looked like a furry dumbbell 
  it did 
go  go  go  it s the cat  it s the cat 
i m here about the squirrel 
oh 
uh   
mr  buckman  how nice to see you  come in 
he looks good  right 
in my philosophical opinion 
this squirrel is just fine 
you feel okay  ulysses 
he has the power to understand 
and we can t return him to the wild 
he s here for a reason 
and we re going to help him find it 
i thought a squirrel
stealing from
my bird feeder was impressive 
hey  look 
okay  it feels superhero y 
 forever and wanting is stomach  
it s poetry  he s a great poet 
or he s hungry 
and then it just  whoosh  took off 
squirrels don t fly 
they leap great distances 
not this one 
so  it was with a little girl 
yeah  and her dad  it was her pet 
squirrels can t be domesticated 
they can be docile enough
to handle if they re diseased 
  rabies 
  i didn t say that 
  but it s rabies  oh  its rabies 
  it might be 
definitely  but don t worry about it 
i trained for this 
i think like a squirrel 
and it s my job to keep this town safe 
he s asleep 
long day  even for a superhero 
flora 
hey  that s william spiver 
george buckman  how do you do 
don t worry  nothing broken 
he s hysterically blind 
he s what 
nice to meet you  sir 
nice to meet you 
yeah  i ll come to you  sure 
  how are ya 
  good 
  do you still have the squirrel 
  for now 
okay  we need to hide him in a place
that your mom will never look 
what about my tree house 
she always says she can t look at that 
yes  terrible things says
that best way to avoid detection
is by using an alternate route 
or by curling into a ball
and just screaming 
that s for mountain lions 
  it applies here  too 
  george 
no  okay  all right 
everybody act natural 
very natural and calm  and here we go 
there you are 
didn t know you guys were back 
we re not 
what 
i m so sorry  i m not good under pressure 
did you get rid of the   
wasps  oh  you got it 
wait  we have wasps 
right  she s  um  talking about the   
the squirrel  he s gone 
exactly  so  i guess we re all set 
and there s nothin  to worry about 
you re so weird 
we nailed that 
we absolutely nailed that 
anything she threw at us  we nailed it 
all right  okay  i gotta go to work 
got the restocking shift tonight 
  okay  i ll keep him safe 
  yeah  i know you will 
dad 
you know how in terrible things
it says   do not hope  only observe  
maybe it s okay to hope 
there was a superhero in our midst 
we had yet to learn his purpose 
or his style 
but we knew how he made us feel 
last time on
our squirrels of beverly hills   
that maybe
there was light in the darkness   
you look like a chipmunk 
   and maybe the best part
of having a superhero around
is how you start to feel like one  too 
squirrels 
hmm 
i m better than a squirrel 
it s called a pop tart 
it s kinda like a donut
that got run over by a car 
flora 
ever heard of knocking 
sorry  i heard your voice from my yard 
my blindness gives me
a more advanced sense of hearing 
i m over here 
oh   
and  by the way  you almost
knocked down ulysses  pop tart 
make yourself at home 
thank you  i m sent here
for the entire summer 
but nobody really planned
anything for me to do 
why were you sent away 
uh   
anyway  i  um  brought him this 
it s rilke 
my father would read this to me 
 you 
sent out beyond your recall 
 flare up like a flame
and make big shadows i can move in  
 flare up like a flame  
hear that  ulysses 
flare up like a flame
and find your purpose 
he has a purpose 
every superhero has a purpose 
i m sorry  but i don t think
your squirrel is a superhero 
he may be very special 
and he knows how to type  but if you   
william 
holy bagumba 
 flare up like a flame  
hello 
nothing broken  is the pop tart okay 
the universe was expanding 
but it didn t feel any scarier 
it felt like it was just making room 
uh  we called george in  sir 
this is comin  out of his check 
i can tell you that 
how many boxes of pushpins is this 
probably 15 
and how much is a box 
on sale for 39ยข 
that s   
definitely comin  out of his check 
five dollars out of his check 
just pretend you re in a tree 
  let s go  william 
  where are we 
comic cave  we have to prepare ulysses
for a more dangerous world 
good plan 
but it doesn t seem that dangerous 
look who it is

its specialty is making grown men cry 
i m here on superhero related business 
if you re gonna
bad mouth spider man again 
i m not havin  it

all i said
was that incandesto can beat him 
with light  are you crazy 
the light of a thousand suns 
throw spider man into the sun
and see how he feels 
the sun is 27 million degrees 
it s pretty hot for a guy in jammies 
that s true  didn t think of that 
hey  what s his deal 
i m hysterically blind 
would you mind if i felt your face 
yes 
fair enough  i will attempt to read
your features using echolocation 
what do you guys want 
do you have anything
on superhero training 
specifically  small furry mammals 
  no 
  then just regular superheroes 
  no 
  superhero purpose discovery 
  nope 
  being a superhero for dummies 
not really a self help genre 
flora  over here 
animal control
is on the scene investigating 
but  rita  what did they tell you
about the attack 
they said
it was definitely rabies 
and it was in my hair 
trying to give me rabies 
and did it look diseased 
yes  it was covered in rabies 
wow  well  let s hope
they capture this squirrel
before the disease spreads
to our pets and our children 
oh  no 
he s a fugitive 
  we ve gotta get to dad

i don t know if we were great
in the superhero world 
since we were missing a door
and william fell out at a stoplight 
but injustice was being defeated 
and we were part of it 
see you tomorrow 
i will not see you 
but i will hear and smell you tomorrow 
thanks for keeping it weird 
hey  guys  just in time for dinner 
okay  phyllis  open up  you got this 
go wait in the tree house 
dad always said the best trap
for a superhero was a feast 
if there was soup cooking 
you were probably next 
but incandesto always knew
what to look for 
carrots 
the main ingredient in people s soup 
mmm mmm 
so  anything goin  on 
you can tell me  i m letting things in 
i don t love this soup 
well  you make it 
oh 
i mean  thank you for your feedback 
um  so   
  your big interview s tomorrow  right 
  yeah 
  you nervous 
  no 
marissa says it ll just be
basic questions  fluff piece 
yes  i m terrified 
because what if i fail 
and this book won t sell
without good press 
you know what 
if you want any backup 
i m happy to come along 
you would do that 
even though we re   
  separated 
  yeah 
i still want you
to do well  phyllis 
that ll never change 
thanks 
i do have one condition  though 
you gotta let the squirrel back in 
what s that now 
he is a special creature
with a lot to offer the world 
and we need to protect special creatures 
not be afraid of them 
so  he s been livin  in the tree house 
oh 
george 
here he is 
also  i quit my job 
mom was inspired again 
something was changing in all of us 
and hopefully 
it wasn t the mashed potatoes
we had just eaten off the floor 
mom said you could sleep out here tonight 
i told her that your apartment
was under construction 
not that animal control is waiting there
to shoot you with a dart 
thank you  sweetie 
why can t you just tell her
that you don t want to get divorced 
sometimes it s easier
to draw a superhero than to act like one 
i love you 
i love you 3000 
i m just so proud that i could bring
more beauty into the world 
and you two have been married for   
fifteen years 
  wow 
  yeah  15 good ones 
hmm  is it weird
being married to a romance writer 
i mean  you have to compete
with all those guys she writes about 
how do you still sweep her away 
i was never good at any of that  no 
  anyway   
  she swept me away 
not with a white horse or anything 
but with    with a laugh 
she has this amazing laugh
that just lights up a room 
and this is your next book 
yeah  yeah  but  hey  no peeking 
it s actually a departure for me 
it s basically  it s   
poetry 
huh 
oh  uh   
yeah  but it s garbage 
it s just something
i do to warm up the keys 
  mmm hmm 
  huh   
  but anyway  the book  it s   
   i like it inside 
 blankets  food  flora breathing 
 i am hungry no more  i broke the table  
based in the roaring  20s 
when romance was   
have you written anything 
i think i have enough 
good luck 
oh  no  no 
wait  wait 
i thought you did terrific 
i should get back to work 
okay 
it turns out  the hardest thing
about having hope
is watching the people who don t 
and the only thing harder than that
is watching the people who once did 
hey 
the window is busy this week 
my apartment s being watched 
they want the squirrel 
it s good that i skipped bowling tonight 
in  in  in 
and even in the darkest of times 
a true hero will risk everything
to save the world he loves 
i m in trouble 
i feel like everything
is just slipping away 
when i met the other dr  meescham 
our country was at war 
each day was uncertain 
but we always said goodbye to each other
the best way we could 
we said 
 i promise to always turn back to you  
and why did you do that 
 cause when you turn back  you see
that the person you love is still there 
and when you don t turn back 
that is when they slip away 
for that s the moment
that they need you the most 
phyllis 
yeah 
ulysses 
ulysses 
 dear flora 
 i am very fond of you 
 but i hear my call to the wild 
and i must return to my natural habitat 
 yours  mr  squirrel  
william  william spiver 
  flora 
  he s gone 
  who is 
  ulysses 
i think my mom kidnapped him 
are you crying 
no 
i have her jack and rose 
i m holding them hostage 
  makes sense 
  are you gonna help me or not 
of course 
i just have to take off my bathrobe
and run a comb through   
hurry  we have a hostage 
i am 
shoo  shoo 
just go 
you re making things so much harder 
do you understand that 
we all needed that interview to go well 
nothing is going right for me 
and it s all on me to fix it 
nobody cares 
that s   
that s for me 
and so  your plan is to offer an exchange 
  the jack and rose for the squirrel 
  yes 
but you have no idea where your mother is 
i didn t say it was a perfect plan 
i suppose 
at least it s a plan 
i ve found that when you act
without any thought or reason 
much worse things can happen 
oh  boy 
if i could see 
would i be freaking out right now 
you d probably say
that we need to find shelter 
rather quickly 
come on 
what is this place 
splash rapids 
me and my family used to
ride our bikes here every saturday 
dad would bring a second swimsuit
and let it float next to him
in the lazy river 
just to watch the lifeguards freak out 
and then it closed 
i pushed a car into a lake 
what 
that s why my mother sent me away 
i was taking revenge on jacob 
her new husband 
where s your father 
he died 
oh 
jacob wouldn t stop calling me  billy  
billy s not my name 
my name is william  william spiver 
but he kept calling me billy 
i just couldn t take it 
 william  was my father s name 
he was a man
of great humanity and intelligence 
he played the piano 
and he knew about
astronomy and the universe 
jacob doesn t know there even are stars 
he just knows about his car 
hello 
the journalist
was wrong about his poetry 
a squirrel sees it 
he sees all the beauty in the world 
he sees flora 
i can t believe
i m losing my family
because i can t view the world
like a squirrel 
it s definitely not how i thought
the week was gonna turn out 
do you know how much
it costs to get a new car door 
more than the actual car 
you haven t lost anybody 
i just forgot to turn back 
where s flora 
what are you thinking about 
the illuminated adventures
of the amazing incandesto 
there s this picture of alfred t  slipper
looking out at the world 
and dolores is on his shoulder 
and he turns to her and says 
 i m alone in the world  dolores 
 and i m homesick for my own kind  
i m homesick 
i miss my family 
i miss what we used to be 
but you re not alone 
flora 
don t take another step 
show me ulysses 
or jack and rose are dead 
the figurine 
i know the ones in the movie are dead 
it s okay  he s right here 
good 
now  slowly hand him to william 
and i will slowly   
oh  dang it 
jack and rose have the worst luck 
that was just a decoy 
no  it wasn t 
i was gonna take him away  flora 
and then   
i saw this 
okay  you don t have to do that anymore 
it s okay 
 words for flora 
 nothing would be easier without you
because you are everything 
 all of it 
 cheese puffs  corks  giant donuts   
 you are the ever expanding
universe to me  
you are everything 
my life is screwed up  but you aren t 
you re what i did right 
how could i ever forget
that there s magic in the world
when you re standing right in front of me 
yeah 
  ulysses 
  nobody move 
  don t hurt him 
  stand down 
  george 
  get him  get him 
george 
dad 
got him 
stop  he doesn t have rabies 
that s not somethin  we can risk 
and the only way
to do that is to test his brain tissue 
look  i m sorry 
he ll be euthanized this afternoon 
no 
flare up like a flame  ulysses 
flare up like a flame 
oh  baby  it s okay  it s okay 
okay  flora 
do you remember
how incandesto overcame the odds
and defeated the darkness
of a thousand hands 
he teamed up with dolores 
yes  and 
and the thorny blowfish 
really 
okay 
for you 
i ll be the thorny blowfish any day 
good   cause i feel like
you re the only one of us
who will actually
punch somebody in the face 
  oh  you got that right 
  hey 
is there a fourth weird character 
there was a talking chair 
i ll take it 
okay 
all right  all right 
let s finish this 
you don t come into our water park
unless you re ready to make some waves 
do you want me to slow down 
nope 
i like the sport model 
we ve got this 
wait

yeah  but they won t know
who s not coming

hello

what a wonderful adventure 
i haven t driven the other dr  meescham s
car since my license was revoked 
yeah

before somebody sees us 
okay  i m comin  
you remembered to turn back 
i did 
   over  stand by 
come on  boy 
he ll be in that lab 
it s locked  it s locked 
i could squeeze through that vent
and open the door from the inside 
no  i ll do it 
i seem to have a knack
for absorbing short falls 
you okay 
nothing broken 
i can t see anything 
it s okay  i ll use echolocation 
all clear 
i thought you said it was all clear 
i meant for me 
your position would have a different echo 
now everything has an echo 
you know what  the lab must be
on the other side of those doors 
okay 
let s go  we ve got this 
you don t have to do this 
when i asked my father
about the expanding universe 
he said   maybe it s just putting things
where they re supposed to be  
i think this is where i m supposed to be 
i think so  too 
william 
skunk

  what s going on

stand down  i can t look 
george 
  george 
  dad 
i m flying 
every superhero
comes to us with a purpose 
we don t always see it at first 
because we don t
always know where to look 
this is amazing 
but ulysses showed us   
   the world is filled
with wonder and magic 
huh 
ulysses 
and we found it in the people we love 
i can t even feel my leg 
here 
you re not coming 
this is not my adventure  dear 
did we just break a magical squirrel
out of animal jail 
we did 
thanks  ulysses 
  are you okay 
  oh  yeah 
oh   
oh  gee   
the world is full of injustice 
and there are always
other people who need saving 
which meant that
the most heroic thing we could do
was to say goodbye 
don t give up 
on my comics 
on me 
never 
thank you  ulysses 
go on  now 
flare up like a flame 
hey  buckmans 
you re not gettin  rid o  me 
turn him over 
he s all yours 
oh   
so much rabies 
the world was as it should be 
ulysses could stay hidden from
those who would do him harm 
and be ready to defend those in need 
we had love 
and we had comic books 
not just the ones we got to read 
but the ones we got to live 
people will say it didn t happen 
that squirrels can t write poetry 
and that the world
isn t full of superheroes 
but like any natural born cynic   
   i say   do not hope  observe  
because when you do 
you ll see how much wonder
the world actually has 
and you won t be a cynic anymore 
even after he bit me in the face 
that rattlesnake knew 
i wasn t leavin  the hole until he did 
wow 
you re not afraid of anything 
i am afraid of some things
