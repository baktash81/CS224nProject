ballasting the corpse  see 
that means you fill it
with certain things because   
you may not be aware that
a corpse under water
swells up with air  see 
so it tends to float
to the surface 
you have to load it
with ballast so it sinks 
you weight it down with stones
and other heavy stuff 
there s a ballast ratio
for corpses   
three times body weight
for an average adult
like this victim 
but for children
and midgets it s different 
kids are lighter 
so it s four times body weight 
what 
  never had problems 
no  midgets are heavier 
so you double the weight 
midgets have denser bones
so you double the weight 
for old people  multiply by five 
old bones are porous 
  hi  mom 
  goodness gracious 
how s my little boy 
this is mom  that s grandma 
this is the store 
this is where i grew up 
grandpa s not here 
  he s out 
he ll be back soon 
what time is it 
guess what   
my grandpa 
i ve put up with her now
for 53 years 
imagine that 
imagine the effort it took him 
guess who made the effort 
me or him 
hats off  i ve put up
with her now for 53 years 
he was such a cheerful little boy 
full of pranks 
and blond as a field of wheat 
don t tease me  papa 
  stop it or i ll cry 
you ruin everything 
benoit was such a delight 
  a good boy 
  a darling 
he was affectionate and sweet 
laughing all the time  all the time 
what do you mean   he was  
he s not anymore 
you don t understand me  papa 
how they bickered 
like cats and dogs 
lights 
i usually start the month
with a postman 
i get up in the morning
and spend it pinching pensions 
at the same time this allows me
to locate old folks with money 
what i avoid are young couples 
they stink of poverty 
it s unpleasant 
but old folks are loaded  that s for sure 
i ve never seen an old pauper 
stingy  yes  but paupers  never 
you watching me    or the kids 
they have guns just like me 
not bad at all  these gadgets 
give me one 
go on and play 
no school today 
that s the trouble with women 
sure i ve been hurt before 
i gave them something 
they gave me something 
but there comes a time
when you start to ask questions 
all on account of that little door 
in a couple 
the door has to stay open 
and when it s open
it s either to bring
in new nourishment   
or it s to let you out 
either you add a little seed   
and that seed can be a baby 
or a good time or a holiday   
or you get out 
lock  stock and seed 
with women  you can t always tell
if the door s open
and if it s time to add a seed 
or get the hell out 
i ve been hurt
because i d open the door wide 
and they d shut it 
love leaves a trail of sulfur
like some lingering smell 
as soon as you meet someone 
you smell it 
like when you take a leak 
your fingers smell 
you have to wash them
two or three times
so you can forget you pissed 
watch me  i ll show you a trick 
as a kid they called me
 the octopus  
know why 
because i could make
any part of my body move on its own 
i ll show you 
all by itself  watch my nose 
look 
now my ears  watch closely 
see that  look 
now the right one 
now the left    see 
i can make something else move 
but it s not for the camera 
turn it off  you jerk 
  got home okay last night 
  no problem 
i figured you guys
must have been bushed 
throw the keys down 
or are you coming down 
i ll throw you the keys 
it s not the right key 
it s not this one 
must be the other one 
look who s here  benoit 
i m so glad to see you 
what a surprise 
how ve you been 
fine  jenny 
i m here with a camera   
they re doing a thing on me 
do you mind 
  not at all 
come in  come in 
don t stay out there 
so what s new 
  i had a rough time locating you 
i thought you still lived at sablon 
we were evicted by urban renewal 
here s where we wound up 
  maurice gave me the address 
i m so glad to see you 
got anything to drink 
my throat s dry 
  what ll it be 
  some of your brandy 
  how about your friends 
  ask them 
  what ll it be 
  something cold 
  and you  sir 
  a beer for me 
  and you 
  a brandy as well 
coming up 
that s myjenny 
that s her  this is her world 
that s her in her prime 
when she was a beauty 
she s still a beauty 
that s when i met her 
this is jenny s bed 
i ll show you something 
you can tan while you make love 
when you re through 
you ve got a brown ass 
ever see anything like it  bet not 
what nonsense 
baloney  baloney   
jenny used to live   
i told you she moved 
that s why we had trouble finding her 
she lived 30 years
in the sablon district 
then some real estate developer   
i can t remember the name 
but the hell with it   
decided just like that
to move in   sure they could   
the law s on their side 
we didn t own the house 
anyway  they raised holy hell 
threw everyone out 
but it was the way
they went about it   
so  they told jenny to move out   
there was this little smart ass 
a vulgar littlejerk 
who had the nerve
to speak and behave rudely
with jenny   
the sablon may have got a face lift 
but one guy s no longer around
to enjoy it 
it s only fair if a member
of the family is wronged   
so i went and had a little talk
with that fella   
i ll call you back  sweets 
i m still working 
talk to you in a sec 
those bastards 
a black night watchman 
what a dirty trick 
so you can t see him 
who d ever sink so low 
they ll stop at nothing 
poor kid  born under the sun 
i bet he grew up
under the baobabs 
and here he is on a work site 
it makes me sick 
they try to get away with murder 
it s like this cement  hungarian
probably  made to last temporarily 
you can be sure they use
more sand than cement  too 
they pinch pennies 
then the walls crack 
the whole building crumbles 
i once buried two arabs
in a wall over there   
facing mecca  of course   
in two years their assholes
will see daylight 
let s go sink this mubutu 
a handsome fella to boot 
but i m warning you 
i won t touch him 
why not 
al ds  remy   
al ds  green monkeys 
grab him by the galoshes 
but i won t touch him 
but why s he in yellow
if he s in camouflage 
at least he had no dogs 
usually they have a pack of curs 
i hate them  blacks have a way
with animals  you know 
that s a fact 
they know how to talk to them 
here s our golden opportunity 
to see if that legend
about their size is true 
remy  pull his pants down 
we ll know in a jiffy 
good lord 
he s really well hung 
you can wrap it up now 
it s disgusting 
the kid s barely 18
and already hung like a polar bear 
kids like that often work
in nightclubs 
it s their livelihood 
he must be a prude
to take a job like this 
but some guys make a living
with their organ  awful  isn t it 
what s so funny 
it sure won t make you a living 
here we are in a neighborhood
of mostly senior citizens 
planners design so called
low cost housing 
flats meant for young people 
for newlyweds setting up house 
for workers 
for housewives 
and maybe even the unemployed 
it s all part
of the district renewal plan
that aims to bring old folks
out of isolation by mixing them
with the working population 
it s a great idea 
but what i don t like is   
and here s the rub   
how can you design
low cost housing projects
in total disregard for aesthetics 
i can t accept that  i m sorry 
they thought of planting
japanese cherry trees
along the lanes  see 
in the style of english beach resorts 
a truly grand idea 
but did they do it 
did they do it 
  no 
yes  they did 
but they didn t follow through 
that s the shame of it 
it was purely cosmetic 
just to dazzle them 
and people fell for it 
i followed it all 
i saw how far their bright ideas went 
what do you notice at first glance 
what stands out 
the red bricks 
what s red bring to mind 
red is the color of blood 
of indians 
it s the color of violence 
and the scourge of society   
as everybody agrees    is violence 
so why the red bricks 
red is also the color of wine   
for wining and dining 
it s all about palm greasing 
dirty politicians
and wheeling and dealing 
it pains me 
wherever you take your camera   
folks would love to stop and say 
 what a lovely flower bed 
what powerful asymmetry  
 what a beautiful red hue of brick  
but they never get the chance 
instead they sit in front
of their tv sets 
if i d been asked to design
that kind of a layout 
i d have planned
ground level homes
with spacious lawns 
a bit like frank lloyd wright 
in the style ofjapanese houses 
despite their faults 
those people sure know how to live 
you know  emphasizing aesthetics
is one thing 
stressing the functional is another 
those guys
overemphasize the functional 
unlike people like gaudi 
who had a magnificent
architectural style 
a very organic style 
forms that grow out of nowhere 
or horta who did
such fabulous things 
those great whiplash effects 
sorry to disturb you 
we re a television crew 
we re doing a report on loneliness
in high rise apartments 
would you mind answering
a few questions 
of course 
if it doesn t take too long 
i promise we ll be brief 
come in 
you ll hardly notice us 
this is the crew 
sit down 
go ahead 
don t let the camera intimidate you 
just act and speak naturally 
it bothers me none 
i was filmed once in mons 
there was an army band concert 
i enjoyed that 
that s fine  our subject
is used to the camera 
just fine 
may i ask my first question 
  of course 
tell me  madam 
among your friends and acquaintances 
does anyone visit you regularly 
i have acquaintances   
but i get along with everybody 
they call me granny   
granny snuff  ever been snuffed out 
this is a special case 
when i came in  i immediately
noticed the box of sedocar 
you may not know this 
but sedocar is a drug
for heart patients 
so i just freaked her out 
which saves me a bullet 
it s so much easier on the neighbors 
on me  and on her 
i like to try out new work methods 
she s fading fast now 
we may as well go straight
to the heart of the matter 
let s hit the jackpot 
on to the kitchen 
lift the tablecloth 
i m gonna have a drink 
help yourselves 
there s plenty for all 
i know you re filming
on a shoestring budget 
i believe in sharing  no problem 
thanks  ben 
back to work 
follow me and i ll show you 
i bet there s something
under the bed 
i don t know  but i have
a feeling about this room 
the little hog 
now i ll show you something 
here s the jewelry 
glassware and stuff   
the old lady whet my appetite 
know what i d like  remy 
a nice big plate of mussels 
with lots of veggies 
sauce  and fries 
where can you get mussels 
  a restaurant 
  by the sea 
you re my guests for a seaside dinner 
what do you say 
it s a two hour drive 
a big plate of mussels 
some drinks   
it ll be a great evening 
just to celebrate 
what s wrong 
what s the matter 
don t you like mussels 
sure  i do 
then why the blank look 
let s go 
i think andre has to be home tonight 
  you have to go home 
  i had other plans 
then call home
and let s hit the road 
patrick 
what about him 
without andre  there s no point   
i m the guy who should be invited 
let s paint the town red 
what if we went another time 
they have commitments 
it s okay  if i plan in advance 
it s nice of you  ben 
then come with me 
i have no car 
  we ll all go some other time 
  okay  forget it 
i ll find a restaurant nearby 
never mind  guys 
it ll be for another time 
sure  no problem  another time 
we ll have plenty of opportunities 
sure we will 
see you around 
let me know when you need me 
  do you want a lift 
  walking s good for the appetite 
  we ll give you a lift 
  i d rather walk  for the appetite 
thanks anyway  guys 
andre hinted earlier
that you might have trouble
financing the rest of your film 
i m naturally ready to share
the cost of film 
  i d be delighted 
  that s nice of you 
and if we have to work overtime 
we ll do it 
we ll turn this film into an epic 
a toast to the old lady 
white or red 
shall i choose 
we ll have this one 
i m afraid that s not
the wisest choice today 
if you ll allow me   
  i ll allow you nothing 
take care of your face case 
then you can make allowances 
at times  crafty as a fox 
at times  a little rascal 
at times  a gangster 
but generous as they come 
whatever the amount
you need  remy 
benoit will always 
and i mean always  deliver 
thanks  ben 
in a kingdom by the sea 
along clear gulfs 
and plump waves
to stop the waves 
and flying fish  gliding like gulls 
and plankton to your heart s content 
and red salmon
leaping from the heavens 
the sourjellyfish
and purple seaweed 
and the winter s kelp   
nothing shall stop me
from calling your name   
sea  sea  sea  o cruel mother 
oh  say  can you see   
what are you waiting for 
douche bag  high tide 
we d better go 
bring us a mop  please 
i m all right 
must be bad mussels 
you don t feel sick 
  i m okay 
let s go home 
i ll pay and we ll leave 
meet valerie   
thanks to her many worldly contacts 
she s given me a taste
of various artistic circles 
some of those circles
are very closed 
today we re in the world
of painting 
i have a keen interest in that world 
this is a very nice swedish exhibit 
had a look 
the swedish are interesting   
intensely sensitive 
an artist i really appreciate
is bernard buffet 
know his work 
you know who i mean 
he did a poster for robert hossein   
heard of him  no 
for a show called
 the life ofjesus  
it shows a big hand
reaching up to the sky 
and the hand s meant
to evokejesus 
the scarification
and all that jazz 
big hands  big drawings   
a knockout 
hossein sure knows
how to pick his collaborators 
you like hossein 
his shows are great 
seen any 
a great actor  too 
he s made lots of movies 
he used to play dark romantic types
in those old costume pictures 
do you know ben s trade 
you can speak up 
your silence is eloquent 
some trade 
  dummy 
doesn t it bother you 
i don t pry into his work 
everyone s got to eat 
besides  we re old friends 
talking about buffet 
here it comes 
over this way 
don t be afraid 
the camera makes him nervous 
help yourselves to canapes 
i only eat the top part 
  what note did you just play 
  oh  it s an f sharp 
  and what did you play 
  an f natural 
that s right  ducky 
in 4  4 time 
i met valerie at the conservatory 
keep in time 
you re playing too fast 
she must ve been about 10 
she had long dark braids
right behind her ears 
little white ankle socks
and a little skirt 
she was always smiling 
running here and there 
always late 
we used to laugh about it 
i must have been 17 or 18 
and i took her under my wing
right off 
she d play minuets
and short pieces for me 
i d try to accompany her 
she went on to make a career
for herself  as you know 
and i m proud of her 
i changed instruments 
the piano 
the blunderbuss 
but it s like a horn 
it needs polishing 
stay on his tail 
you idiot 
  i think i hit him 
  where d he go 
in there 
he came this way 
say  remy   
smell something funny 
  what is it 
  chickenshit 
we re warm 
doomsday is near 
come and look 
up there by the skylight 
look  remy 
look  patrick 
it s a pair  it s mating season 
look at this feather 
it s oily 
the male secretes
a pungent greasy substance
that lures the female 
that s mother nature 
pigeon  winged cloak of grey 
in the city s hellish maw 
one glance and you fly away 
your grace holds me in awe 
shit  shit  shit   
got a problem 
i lost something 
my i d  bracelet 
  what 
i lost my i d  bracelet 
goddamn it 
  sentimental value 
  first communion 
it s a pain losing it  huh 
it was a pain to steal 
there aren t many kids around
with my first name 
it s worth a small fortune 
i bought it with dad 
patrick 
see anything 
  nothing down here 
remy 
look over the railing 
  here 
  to the left 
here 
don t see a thing 
move up  i see something shiny 
take a good look  go up two steps 
there s something shiny
to your right 
here 
that s not it 
it s just a piece of metal 
this happened to me in biarritz 
the only time   
find anything 
   i went swimming with my signet ring 
and lost it among the rocks 
no way of finding it  just like now 
i d need a metal detector 
got a zoom lens 
can you zoom in and find him 
you okay 
sorry about your pal 
it was an accident 
stop it  kid  you start like that
and it becomes a habit   
that s revenge    stop it 
come on    i understand    stop it 
i ll buy you a drink at malou s 
i completely forgot
about this one 
help me get him in the trunk 
take his feet 
we ll make it a quick one 
i m beat 
hi  malou  how s life 
  fine 
not much action 
not for now  it ll pick up 
you gotta have hope 
here you go 
see anything worthwhile 
i saw a real good boxing match 
the moroccan featherweight   
a massacre   
he clobbered little freddy 
they wipe us out everywhere 
even in the ring  it s amazing 
it s awful 
real quick on his feet 
the little moroccan   
and i mean little 
  they all are 
you weren t big
in the ring yourself 
no  but i had a real wallop 
  you sure did 
  that s what counts  the wallop 
take the train station murder 
the restroom murder 
who got the headlines  who 
come on  who got the headlines 
  the dentist 
  the dental mechanic 
and the toilet attendant
didn t even get a single line 
little guys don t make waves 
if you kill a whale 
you get greenpeace
and jacques cousteau on your back 
but wipe out sardines
and you get a canning subsidy 
i go for the small fry 
  you re afraid of the big fish 
  what 
  afraid of the big fish 
  you don t get it  bug off 
i d rather talk to him 
i m not afraid of big stuff  remy 
honestly i m not 
i just don t like to make a fuss 
i hate making waves 
i work small and reap big 
but i know the nice suburbs 
anytime you wanna go 
  let s go then 
  whenever you like 
  not tonight 
  why not 
because we lost our sound man 
and without him
i don t feel up to it 
and i still have to dump the cabbie 
i m going to the quarry 
the canal s a drag 
this one s on me 
anyway   
the shooting s temporarily on hold 
patrick  our sound man   
is dead 
things like that are
really hard to talk about 
this may sound like a cliche   
but it s an occupational hazard 
we re all aware of that 
i think patrick was 
and i think we should continue
the film   
because this is your film  patrick 
that s what i wanted to tell you   
that we re all thinking of you   
and marie paule 
the girl you just moved in with   
who s carrying your child 
so long  patrick 
bear up  marie paule 
no  no  that one s much too big 
too near the street 
hold on a bit   
stop here  remy 
yeah  here   
you wanted a nice suburban home 
take your pick 
nice grounds 
all we have to do now is wait 
we wait nice and quiet
until dark 
hand me a beer 
who shook up the beers 
i haven t always been   
check that out 
ten years from now
she ll be sucking dick like her mother 
nature really does things right 
amazing  and she doesn t even
know it yet 
doesn t even know
the color of a cock 
say  remy  that reminds me   
aren t there a hell of a lot of gays
in your trade 
in show biz 
you oughta know 
there are more in your trade
than in most normal trades 
you can say what you want 
you don t mind me talking
about it 
look at charles trenet 
now there s a flagrant case for you 
i think they re all over the place 
you know   
it doesn t bother me personally 
you must know a few 
  like cocteau 
no  that s jean marais 
but you must know some gays  andre 
i was watching you three
the other day 
you wouldn t happen to be gay 
no kidding  remy 
because i don t mind if you are   
no 
close the door  remy 
she ll calm down soon enough 
honey 
catherine  get the door 
who was it  darling 
andre  remy 
does this remind you of anything 
the old gun 
philippe noiret 
a nice movie 
franco  over here 
stick the mike here 
that s my idea 
fat noiret didn t do that 
noiret s put on weight 
mommy  mommy 
i lost him 
kid 
come on out 
it s just for fun  kid 
little bugger 
come on  kid 
you can t stay in the woods alone 
put out your spotlight 
put it on 
get him 
mommy 
what the fuck are you doing 
catch him  you morons 
damn it  he s as turbulent
as his mother 
remy  gimme a hand 
get his arms and legs 
filthy kid  goddamn it 
hold his arms 
do you kill many children 
no 
you must have noticed that i don t really
have the knack in this department 
this must be my second or third kid
in five years 
why 
  i don t like infanticide 
  why not 
kids aren t good business  remy 
in theory  they re not bankable 
understand 
you can still make something off him 
you must mean kidnapping 
but i think it s more of a nuisance
than anything else 
especially
when the media gets involved 
now hold on 
i m not talking about you 
you re pretty discreet 
congrats 
that ll do it 
the little creep really had us going 
nothing here 
we really blew it 
i warned you about suburban homes 
there are credit cards 
you might as well
call the cops right now 
go on  there s the phone 
this is bullshit 
and we re running out
of cash for film 
and we re running out
of cash for film 
the problem s not cash 
that  i have 
it s those three innocents 
there oughta be a law 
well  i m    i m not   
i m not a lunatic 
it s a shame to let big houses
fall into neglect like this 
throw a coat of paint
on the walls and mirrors   
and it s versailles 
could be  but it ll take more coats
than you think 
your bad breath is
something awful  remy 
you shouldn t talk
under people s noses 
because it s really unpleasant 
watch out for the window  andre 
stop bumping into things 
really  i don t know why 
but all day long
you stink like a billy goat
when you talk loud under people s noses 
don t mind the mess 
come on 
how much you need this time 
how much 
  10 000 
10 000 
damn it  you spend it faster
than i make it  remy 
let me tell you something  remy 
your spotlight gets on my tits 
sorry  but there s not enough light 
i know  but yesterday with the kid
it blinded me and disrupted my work 
  i m sorry 
  sure  you re sorry

right before he died  i told him 
 come on 
we ve got enough footage 
we ve got enough sound  
and he said 
 we ll never have enough  
he was a charming boy   
who wouldn t compromise   
we re all thinking of you  franco 
and this film s dedicated to you 
and i m thinking of marie paule 
your girlfriend   
who s carrying   
your child 
ricardo giovanni 
alias the nightingale 
capable but dissolute 
much too dissolute 
like all mediterraneans 
come on out

i m a director  this is my team   
holy smoke  andre 
get a load of the big camera

don t give him a drink 
he shouldn t 
  why not 
  he s been sick 
  really 
  yes  indeed 
what did he have 
vascular spasms 
he could get a heart attack 
so be careful 
he mustn t overdo it 
one glass   
he forgets  too 
he forgets what he drinks 
and that makes it even worse 
understand 
  yes  sure 
he doesn t realize it 
you promise

he had time to kick me
in the nuts 
i can t move in this thing 
he got out of that nicely 
you could have given me
a hand there 
i didn t expect   
teamwork means being able
to count on your colleagues 
but i couldn t count on you
this time  right or wrong

it s a shame 
and stop making faces
behind my back 
thejury handed down its verdict
late this afternoon 
for the last time  benoit patard
stood in the dock 
a sardonic grin on his face 
and his usual smug 
arrogant glint in his eye 
don t talk to me about other murders
until these are proven 
a harsh verdict
for such evidence 
yes  i will be consulting my client
to decide if we ll appeal 
that s all i have to say

first  pick up valerie

where we met the first time 
i d written a poem about autumn 
a thousand leaves mingle
in the misty breeze
plump brown chestnuts
pummel the ground 
yet i remain unharmed 
the cold spews scorn
at summer s dying twitch 
which with a last lazy stroke
warms my limbs aching
from another assault
without trumpets or banners 
see it  here it comes 
the splendid autumn 
  hi  ben
