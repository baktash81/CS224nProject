dune and waterworld are like
the best movies in the last 30 years
did you see kevin costner
hes a fucking merman
did you see the things behind his ears
thats where the gills were
right he was like half fish
what about dune
dune is 80s
waterworlds all water and no dune
and also no sting in the thong
it was like a space thong
space thong you talking about sting
you know what sting does
are you aware of this
he delivers albums
wheres my fucking record grohl
its all up here
is it
yeah its all up here
and in there
and in there
and in there
and in there
not so much here
but i got it man its all in here
i think personally that
doesnt amount to a bucket of frozen shit
okay
i dont know where youd get one
but thats what its about
when you tell me youve got a record
all i got is a bucket of frozen shit
im up to my eyeballs in debt
and i gotta pay some crazy
pieceofshit motherfuckers
who i owe so much money to
and i just found out they may be the ones
who fucking sliced up
that journalist in turkey
i just wanna give you
the album that you want
so you can pay off those people before
they turn your nutsack into a coin purse
relax
did you just say relax
yeah so heres the thing
we were thinking
its our tenth album okay
we cant do the same old shit
we gotta break the mold on this one
yeah shill this record
its gotta blow your fucking dick
right into your fucking mouth
blow your own dick into your mouth
yeah right back up into your mouth man
right back up into your mouth
yeah
like its been there before
what kind of goal is that
i dont want that album
unless it makes me a lot of money
lot of money blow all the dicks you want
look i can get you a studio
anywhere you want in town tomorrow
weve used all those studios
they all sound exactly the same
lets think outside the box
go somewhere weve never been
lets go to a cool like zeppelin
when zeppelin went to the castle
and there was the devil
and wizards and dragons and shit

how are you
so nice to meet you barb weems
this is the house it is incredible
i cant wait to show you
this place i know what youre thinking
it needs a little sprucey goosey
and i agree but heres the thing
this place has
serious rock n roll pedigree
i mean it rolls deep
a huge music manager
owned this place in the 70s and 80s
and threw some wild parties
come come
how sexy is this stonefinish pool
i can already see
the girls in their bikinis
itll be fun
you can invite me to your parties
look at this stateoftheart kitchen
do we have any chefs in the group
im pretty handy on the grill
yeah right guys
yeah
if you like your meat charred and dry
am i right
take a look at the other room
fuck you
this is my favorite room in the house
these are original babette fosters
they stopped production
on those in the 80s
i do love a good sconce
but i dont know
it definitely has a weird energy
do you guys feel that
do you guys get this overwhelming sense
of death and doom or is that just me
yeah like someones
gonna jump through the window
and start stabbing us in the eyes
im gonna be straight with you guys
there was another band
and they lived here in the 90s
they thought the sound was incredible
but they never finished their album
creative differences
i dont know
doesnt really seem like the right fit
whoa do you hear that
thats fucking rad
you hear that
okay so if we put the drums right here
facing this way
we could put the guitar stuff here
and we can do keyboards like over there
we put the mixing desk
in the bedroom up there
you know
well take it
well that is music to my ears baby
ill go draw up the paperwork right now
yay i knew you would love it
okay guys check it out
the sound of this house
is the sound of album 10
no songs yet
but weve got the sound
all right you know the drill
all gear in the house
amps living room
snare drum shitty job living room
expensive shit
guitars by the amp line
in the living room

but i also want to not get decapitated
lets ask her
shes always by the fence lets go
thats you
i thought
we had an infestation of yellow warblers
that was the wood thrush genius
not here little thrush
come to the pool we dont have much time
guys hey
come here
now
howd you get over there so fast
now
i need you boys
to open your minds for a moment
and fucking listen
this house
this is
not just a creepy rock n roll house
we are standing on a nexus
that allows spiritual entities
to cross into our world
can it drummer boy
you ever hear of dream widow
of course they were supposed
to be the next janes addiction
greg null was a fucking genius
yeah till he went batshit crazy
and killed his whole fucking band
right here in this house
thats just rock n roll folklore
i was there
greg null and i were close
very close
i was his number one groupie and muse
now were taking advice from groupies
hey watch the labels
groupies are people too
you gotta understand
this was the roaring 90s
no one gave a fuck about shit
but greg
he was a visionary an artist of the dark
we were all into
some experimental life choices back then
the occult sex
energy transfers and spectrophilia
he possessed this living book
made from human flesh
the book was rumored
to hold the secret incantations
of aleister crowley
as time went on
something truly sinister
took ahold of greg
he was obsessed
with this song from the book
lacrimis de ebrius
the tears of god
every day he made his band
try to complete this song
he believed that
perfecting it would open an eternal portal
and the spirit inside him
would become a demonic passage
into our world
you guys were ghost fuckers
somehow the good won out in greg
and he stopped it
the only way he could
greg killed himself
to stop the completion of the song
but now the spirit that possessed him
has found a new instrument
fuck go go go faster
you guys
shut up go hurry
go go shit shit shit
oh shit
fucker
fucking dolls
fuck fuck fuck
goddamn it i havent spent the last
20 years teaching pilates in encino
so that thing can have its way
you moved next door on purpose
someone had to guard the portal
hes already been possessed
what are we gonna do now
okay bring him down here
maybe i can
just suck it out the oldfashioned way
hell no bad idea
oh sorry old habits
theres got to be a better way
just call the cops
god thats such a good idea
hi dave grohls been possessed
by the spirit of greg null
now hes on a murderous rampage
best idea ive heard since
hey lets move into this house
okay what the fuck should we do
come on
the book
it uses blood to stay alive
he uses raccoons
the basement
he said something about raccoons
when he came up from the basement
okay
find the book
turn to a passage called
van houtens protocol
that will close the portal
and send this fucking spirit back to hell
what about you
youre gonna be in danger
now that youve told us all this
you wanna stay back
and make sure im safe
shes right
nate pat you guys go find the book
taylor go keep dave occupied
drum tracks
you havent done your drum track yet
i aint going near that psycho fuck that
go up there and fuck up the drums
so he cant finish the song
shouldnt be too hard for you
eat a bag of dicks smear
be careful
this is far from a simple possession
that caretaker
is more than just greg null
there is an evil spirit inside him
lets go
no i said im not doing it
im not going near that motherfucker
come on
fuck you
come on
fuck you motherfuckers
yes
he took the fucking sim card
quick pat
ill keep you so fucking safe
i bet you will
take this off take this off
cant get it off
wait wait
put some music on so dave doesnt hear us
good idea
okay lets go
maybe i should wait up here be a lookout
no fucking way dude
come on
im a lumberjack baby
and im gonna cut you down to size
my latest guilty pleasure
this is my shit
and when you hear my motor running
you know i surely
i surely be coppin a rise
so im gonna crank it up
and cut it down
this is my favorite part
this is my favorite part
youre nasty i like that
i aint jacked my lumber baby
jesus
somebody lived down here
greg null
or whatever he is now
fuck dude look
the sacrifice feeds the book
poor little guy
pat find me something
to pry this open with
oh fuck
come on go go
come on
hey buddy how you doing man

i didnt say anything
just play the fucking drums
yeah thats it
yeah
thats it
there you go man
i finished the fucking song
you did
thank you
the van houten protocol
for demonic cleansing
its imperative to confirm
the possessing entity is of demonic origin
before employing these techniques
look for these signs
one digestive system shutdown
no more oatmeal beer bongs for davey
ability to levitate objects
or defy gravity
just play nice with this lsharp bullshit
play eflat and get through it
its an l
l
incessant masturbation
dave what are you doing in there
sounds like youre playing pattycake
with a soft chicken dumpling
didnt he do that already
does that disqualify him
this demonic shit is complicated
insatiable hunger for raw meat
human flesh in particular
fuck i think he ate chris
fuck hes definitely possessed
