dune and waterworld are  like 
the best movies in the last 30 years 
did you see kevin costner 
he s a fucking merman 
did you see the things behind his ears 
that s where the gills were 
 right  he was like half fish 
 what about dune 
dune is  80s 
waterworld s all water  and no dune 
and also no sting in the thong 
it was like a space thong 
space thong  you talking about sting 
you know what sting does 
are you aware of this 
he delivers albums 
where s my fucking record  grohl 
it s all up here 
 is it 
 yeah  it s all up here 
and in there 
and in there 
and in there 
and in there 
not so much here 
but i got it  man  it s all in here 
i think  personally  that
doesn t amount to a bucket of frozen shit 
 okay 
 i don t know where you d get one 
but that s what it s about 
when you tell me you ve got a record 
all i got is a bucket of frozen shit 
i m up to my eyeballs in debt 
and i gotta pay some crazy 
piece of shit motherfuckers 
who i owe so much money to 
and i just found out they may be the ones
who fucking sliced up
that journalist in turkey 
i just wanna give you
the album that you want 
so you can pay off those people before
they turn your nutsack into a coin purse 
 relax 
 did you just say relax 
yeah  so here s the thing 
we were thinking   
it s our tenth album  okay 
we can t do the same old shit 
we gotta break the mold on this one 
yeah  shill  this record 
it s gotta blow your fucking dick
right into your fucking mouth 
blow your own dick into your mouth 
yeah  right back up into your mouth  man 
right back up into your mouth 
 yeah 
 like it s been there before 
what kind of goal is that 
i don t want that album
unless it makes me a lot of money 
lot of money  blow all the dicks you want 
look  i can get you a studio
anywhere you want in town tomorrow 
we ve used all those studios 
they all sound exactly the same 
let s think outside the box 
go somewhere we ve never been 
let s go to a cool   like zeppelin 
when zeppelin went to the castle 
and there was the devil 
and wizards  and dragons  and shit 
you want me to find you
some wizards and dragons 
yes  that s what we should be doing 
you want that  you want that 
watch as i make this happen 
holy shit 
you fuckers are not gonna believe it 
i got it 
you gotta trust me  let me do this 
chilly shills 
what can i do for you  sunshine 
hey  barb  i m here
in my office with the foo fighters 
and they re looking
for a place to record a new album 
you thinking what i m thinking 
oh  i do know what you re thinking 
and i have the perfect place 
foo fighters  oh 
i thought this time would never come 
i gotta jump 
i ll shoot you the address in the a m 
this place is to die for 
pearl jam high five  up top 
jeremy has fucking spoken 
hi  dave grohl  i m barb weems 
 i m such a fan 
 hi  barb  how are you 
 thank you 
 i d love a selfie later  if that s okay 
 okay 
 hello  foos 
how are you 
so nice to meet you  barb weems 
this is the house  it is incredible 
i can t wait to show you 
this place   i know what you re thinking 
it needs a little sprucey goosey 
and i agree  but here s the thing 
this place has
serious rock  n  roll pedigree 
i mean  it rolls deep 
a huge music manager
owned this place in the  70s and  80s
and threw some wild parties 
come  come 
how sexy is this stone finish pool 
i can already see
the girls in their bikinis 
it ll be fun 
you can invite me to your parties 
look at this state of the art kitchen 
do we have any chefs in the group 
i m pretty handy on the grill 
yeah  right  guys 
yeah 
if you like your meat charred and dry 
am i right 
take a look at the other room 
fuck you 
this is my favorite room in the house 
these are original babette fosters 
they stopped production
on those in the  80s 
i do love a good sconce 
but i don t know 
it definitely has a weird energy 
do you guys feel that 
do you guys get this overwhelming sense
of death and doom  or is that just me 
yeah  like someone s
gonna jump through the window
and start stabbing us in the eyes 
i m gonna be straight with you guys 
there was another band 
and they lived here in the  90s 
they thought the sound was incredible 
but they never finished their album 
creative differences 
i don t know 
doesn t really seem like the right fit 
whoa  do you hear that 
that s fucking rad 
you hear that 
okay  so if we put the drums right here 
facing this way   
we could put the guitar stuff here 
and we can do keyboards  like  over there 
we put the mixing desk
in the bedroom up there 
you know 
we ll take it 
well  that is music to my ears  baby 
i ll go draw up the paperwork right now 
yay  i knew you would love it 
okay  guys  check it out 
the sound of this house
is the sound of album 10 
no songs yet 
but we ve got the sound 
all right  you know the drill 
all gear in the house 
amps  living room 
snare drum   shitty job    living room 
expensive shit 
guitars by the amp line
in the living room 
just fucking hate this shit 
just like a quarter of an inch that way 
just a little   
like a hair more  just like a tiny   
no  it s too far  gotta bring it back 
did you hear that 
 i did 
 sweet  huh 
whatever  dave 
who cares about a creepy death vibe 
drum sounds this good 
all right  here s the deal 
shill s a dick 
we know this  right 
but this is our tenth record 
it s gotta be good 
but we gotta make it fast 
we gotta eat  sleep 
and drink this motherfucker 
so i m thinking   
we move in to record 
 what 
 no  no  no  hear me out 
hear me out  hear me out 
two weeks  tops 
maybe a month 
a month in this shithole 
then we go on with our normal lives

hold up  guys  one second  check it out 
krug was really into this place 
the way the drums sounded 
dave  seriously  the guy just
got turned into a fucking bratwurst 
exactly why we should stay here
and make the record  okay

you know  we could dedicate it to krug 
i don t know

a couple drum tracks here in his honor 
exactly 
that s what i m talking about right there 
we ll have some fun with it 
you know  for krug 
people think
i look a lot like willie nelson 
i forgot to tell you 
earlier today  before krug got zapped 
there was this weird dude
in the yard creeping around 
what kind of dude 
some weird guy 
he was trimming the hedges and stuff 
 the killer gardener of encino 
 wouldn t be surprised in this house 
 dave 
 oh  my god

and fucking listen 
this house   
this is
not just a creepy rock  n  roll house 
we are standing on a nexus
that allows spiritual entities
to cross into our world 
can it  drummer boy 
you ever hear of dream widow 
of course  they were supposed
to be the next jane s addiction 
greg null was a fucking genius 
yeah  till he went batshit crazy 
and killed his whole fucking band 
right here in this house 
that s just rock  n  roll folklore 
i was there 
greg null and i were close 
very close 
i was his number one groupie and muse 
now we re taking advice from groupies 
hey  watch the labels 
groupies are people too 
you gotta understand 
this was the roaring  90s 
no one gave a fuck about shit 
but greg   
he was a visionary  an artist of the dark 
we were all into
some experimental life choices back then 
the occult sex 
energy transfers  and spectrophilia 
he possessed this living book 
made from human flesh 
the book was rumored
to hold the secret incantations
of aleister crowley 
as time went on 
something truly sinister
took ahold of greg 
he was obsessed
with this song from the book   
 lacrimis de ebrius  
 the tears of god  
every day he made his band
try to complete this song 
he believed that
perfecting it would open an eternal portal
and the spirit inside him
would become a demonic passage
into our world 
you guys were ghost fuckers 
somehow the good won out in greg 
and he stopped it 
the only way he could 
greg killed himself
to stop the completion of the song 
but now the spirit that possessed him
has found a new instrument 
 fuck  go  go  go  faster 
 you guys   
shut up  go  hurry 
go  go  shit  shit  shit 
oh  shit 
 fucker 
 fucking dolls 
fuck  fuck  fuck 
goddamn it  i haven t spent the last
20 years teaching pilates in encino
so that thing can have its way 
you moved next door on purpose 
someone had to guard the portal 
he s already been possessed 
what are we gonna do now 
okay  bring him down here 
maybe i can
just suck it out the old fashioned way 
hell  no  bad idea 
oh  sorry  old habits 
there s got to be a better way 
just call the cops 
god  that s such a good idea 
 hi  dave grohl s been possessed
by the spirit of greg null 
now he s on a murderous rampage  
best idea i ve heard since 
 hey  let s move into this house  
 okay  what the fuck should we do 
 come on 
the book 
it uses blood to stay alive 
he uses raccoons 
the basement 
he said something about raccoons
when he came up from the basement 
okay 
find the book 
turn to a passage called
 van houten s protocol  
that will close the portal
and send this fucking spirit back to hell 
what about you 
you re gonna be in danger
now that you ve told us all this 
you wanna stay back
and make sure i m safe 
she s right 
nate  pat  you guys go find the book

 the van houten protocol
for demonic cleansing 
it s imperative to confirm
the possessing entity is of demonic origin
before employing these techniques 
look for these signs 
one  digestive system shutdown  
no more oatmeal beer bongs for davey 
 ability to levitate objects 
or defy gravity  
just play nice with this l sharp bullshit 
play e flat and get through it

 incessant masturbation  
dave  what are you doing in there

 insatiable hunger for raw meat 
human flesh in particular

to release the infecting spirit 
copious amounts of holy water

as a conduit of purity  
that won t work 
you don t know what you re doing
