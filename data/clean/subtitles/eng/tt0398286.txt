this is the story of a girl
named rapunzel
and it starts with the sun
once upon a time a single drop
of sunlight fell from the heavens
and from this small drop of sun
grew a magic golden flower
it had the ability to heal
the sick and injured
you see that old woman over there
you might want to remember her
shes kind of important
centuries passed
and a hop skip and a boat ride away
there grew a kingdom
the kingdom was ruled
by a beloved king and queen
and the queen
was about to have a baby
but she got sick
really sick
she was running out of time
and thats when people
start to look for a miracle
or in this case a magic golden flower
i told you shed be important
instead of sharing the suns gift
this woman mother gothel
hoarded its healing power
and used it to keep herself young
for hundreds of years
and all she had to do
was sing a special song
flower gleam and glow
let your power shine
make the clock reverse
bring back what once was mine
what once was mine
you get the gist she sings to it
she turns young creepy right
we found it
the magic of the golden flower
healed the queen
a healthy baby girl a princess
was born with beautiful golden hair
ill give you a hint thats rapunzel
to celebrate her birth
the king and queen
launched a flying lantern into the sky
and for that one moment
everything was perfect
and then that moment ended
flower gleam and glow
let your power shine
make the clock
gothel broke into the castle
stole the child
and just like that gone
the kingdom searched and searched
but they could not find the princess
for deep within the forest
in a hidden tower
gothel raised the child as her own
save what has been lost
bring back what once was mine
what once was mine
gothel had found
her new magic flower
but this time
she was determined to keep it hidden
why cant i go outside
the outside world is a dangerous place
filled with horrible selfish people
you must stay here where youre safe
do you understand flower
yes mommy
but the walls of that tower
could not hide everything
each year on her birthday
the king and queen released
thousands of lanterns into the sky
in hope that one day
their lost princess would return
well i guess
pascals not hiding out here
gotcha
thats 22 for me
how about 23 out of 45
okay well what do you want to do
yeah i dont think so
i like it in here and so do you
come on pascal
its not so bad in there
seven am the usual morning lineup
start on the chores
and sweep till the floors all clean
polish and wax do laundry
and mop and shine up
sweep again and by then its like 715
and so ill read a book
or maybe two or three
ill add a few new paintings
to my gallery
ill play guitar and knit
and cook and basically
just wonder when will my life begin
then after lunch its puzzles
and darts and baking
papiermâché a bit of ballet and chess
pottery and ventriloquy candlemaking
then ill stretch maybe sketch
take a climb sew a dress
and ill reread the books
if i have time to spare
ill paint the walls some more
im sure theres room somewhere
and then ill brush and brush
and brush and brush my hair
stuck in the same place
ive always been
and ill keep wondering and wondering
and wondering and wondering
when will my life begin
tomorrow night
the lights will appear
just like they do
on my birthday each year
what is it like
out there where they glow
now that im older
mother might just let me go
wow i could get used
to a view like this
rider come on
hold on yep im used to it
guys i want a castle
we do this job
you can buy your own castle
hay fever

leaving you after a fight
especially when ive done
absolutely nothing wrong
ive been thinking a lot
about what you said earlier

about the stars
floating lights
and yes im leading up to that
because i really thought
we dropped the issue sweetheart
no mother im just saying
you think im not strong enough

to handle yourself out there
but if you just
were done talking about this

all i was going to say mother is that
i know what i want for my birthday now

new paint
the paint made from the white shells
you once brought me

nor how i came to find you
but may i just say

rapunzel
gesundheit heres the deal
i was in a situation
gallivanting through the forest
i came across your tower and
where is my satchel
ive hidden it
somewhere youll never find it
its in that pot isnt it
would you stop that
now its hidden
where youll never find it
so what do you want with my hair
to cut it

no listen the only thing
i want to do with your hair
is to get out of it literally
wait you dont want my hair
why on earth would i want your hair
look i was being chased
i saw a tower i climbed it
end of story
youre telling the truth
yes
i know i need someone to take me
i think hes telling the truth too
he doesnt have fangs
but what choice do i have
okay flynn rider
im prepared to offer you a deal
deal
look this way
do you know what these are
you mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess
lanterns i knew they werent stars
well tomorrow evening
they will light the night sky
with these lanterns
you will act as my guide
take me to these lanterns
and return me home safely
then and only then
will i return your satchel to you
that is my deal
yeah
no can do
unfortunately the kingdom and i
arent exactly simpatico at the moment
so i wont be taking you anywhere
something brought you here
flynn rider
call it what you will
fate destiny
a horse
so i have made the decision
to trust you
a horrible decision really
but trust me when i tell you this
you can tear this tower apart
brick by brick
but without my help you will never find
your precious satchel
let me get this straight
i take you to see the lanterns
bring you back home
and youll give me back my satchel
i promise
and when i promise something
i never ever break that promise
ever
all right listen
i didnt want to have to do this
but you leave me no choice
here comes the smoulder
this is kind of an off day for me
this doesnt normally happen
fine ill take you to see the lanterns
really
oops
you broke my smoulder
are you coming blondie
look at the world so close
and im halfway to it
look at it all so big
do i even dare
look at me there at last
i just have to do it
should i no
here i go
just smell the grass the dirt
just like i dreamed theyd be
just feel that summer breeze
the way its calling me
for like the first time ever
im completely free
i could go running and racing
and dancing and chasing
and leaping and bounding
hair flying heart pounding
and splashing and reeling
and finally feeling
thats when my life begins
i cant believe i did this
i cant believe i did this
i cant believe i did this
mother would be so furious
but thats okay what she doesnt know
wont kill her right
oh my gosh this would kill her
this is so fun
i am a horrible daughter
im going back
i am never going back
i am a despicable human being
best day ever
you know
i cant help but notice you seem
a little at war with yourself here
what
im only picking up bits and pieces
overprotective mother
forbidden road trip this is serious stuff
but let me ease your conscience
this is part of growing up
a little rebellion a little adventure
thats good healthy even
you think
i know youre way overthinking this
trust me
does your mother deserve it no
would this break her heart
and crush her soul of course
but youve got to do it
break her heart
in half
crush her soul
like a grape
she would be heartbroken youre right
i am arent i oh bother
all right i cant believe im saying this
but im letting you out of the deal
what
thats right but dont thank me
lets turn around and get you home
heres your pan heres your frog
i get back my satchel
you get back a motherdaughter
relationship based on mutual trust
and voilà
we part ways as unlikely friends
no i am seeing those lanterns
oh come on what is it going to take
for me to get my satchel back
i will use this
is it ruffians thugs
have they come for me
stay calm it can probably smell fear
sorry guess im just a little bit jumpy
probably be best if we avoid ruffians
and thugs though
yeah that would probably be best
are you hungry
i know a great place for lunch
where
dont you worry
youll know it when you smell it
a palace horse
wheres your rider
rapunzel
rapunzel let down your hair
i know its around here somewhere
ah there it is the snuggly duckling

on this whole endeavour now do we
well i do like ducklings
yay
garcon your finest table please
you smell that
take a deep breath through the nose
really let that seep in
what are you getting
to me its part mansmell and the other
part is really bad mansmell
i dont know why but overall it smells
like the colour brown your thoughts
thats a lot of hair
shes growing it out
is that blood in your moustache
goldie look at all the blood
in his moustache
good sir thats a lot of blood
you dont look so good blondie maybe
we should get you home call it a day

this is a fivestar joint
if you cant handle this place maybe
you should be back in your tower
is this you

its him all right
greno go find some guards
that reward
is going to buy me a new hook
i could use the money
what about me im broke

ruffians stop
we can work this out
leave him alone
gentlemen please
give me back my guide ruffians
not the nose not the nose
put him down
i dont know where i am and i need him
to take me to see the lanterns
because ive been dreaming about them
my entire life
find your humanity
havent any of you ever had a dream
i had a dream once
im malicious mean and scary
my sneer could curdle dairy
and violencewise
my hands are not the cleanest
but despite my evil look
and my temper and my hook
ive always yearned
to be a concert pianist
cant you see me on the stage
performing mozart
tickling the ivories till they gleam
yep id rather be called deadly
for my killer show tune medley
thank you
cause way down deep inside
ive got a dream
hes got a dream
hes got a dream
see i aint as cruel and vicious
as i seem
though i do like breaking femurs
you can count me with the dreamers
like everybody else ive got a dream
ive got scars and lumps and bruises
plus something here that oozes
and lets not even mention
my complexion
but despite my extra toes
and my goitre and my nose
i really want to make a love connection
cant you see me
with a special little lady
rowing in a rowboat down the stream
though im one disgusting blighter
im a lover not a fighter
cause way down deep inside
ive got a dream
ive got a dream
hes got a dream
ive got a dream
hes got a dream
and i know one day
romance will reign supreme
though my face
leaves people screaming
theres a child behind it dreaming
like everybody else ive got a dream
thor would like to quit and be a florist
gunther does interior design
ulf is into mime
attilas cupcakes are sublime
bruiser knits killer sews
fang does little puppet shows
and vladimir collects ceramic unicorns
what about you
im sorry me
whats your dream
no no no sorry boys i dont sing
i have dreams like you
no really
just much less touchyfeely
they mainly happen
somewhere warm and sunny
on an island that i own
tanned and rested and alone
surrounded by enormous
piles of money
ive got a dream
shes got a dream
ive got a dream
shes got a dream
i just want to see
the floating lanterns gleam
and with every passing hour
im so glad i left my tower
like all you lovely folks
ive got a dream
shes got a dream
hes got a dream
theyve got a dream
weve got a dream
so our differences
aint really that extreme
were one big team
call us brutal
sick
sadistic
and grotesquely optimistic
cause way down deep inside
weve got a dream
ive got a dream
ive got a dream
yes way down deep inside
ive got a dream
i found the guards
wheres rider where is he
i know hes in here somewhere
find him
turn the place upside down
if you have to
go live your dream
i will
your dream stinks
i was talking to her
thanks for everything
i believe
this is the man youre looking for
you got me
sir theres no sign of rider
maximus
whats he doing
a passage come on men lets go
conli make sure those boys
dont get away
play it safe
or go get the crown
i got a dream

somebody get me a glass
because i just found me
a tall drink of water
oh stop it you big lug
where does that tunnel let out
knife
i didnt know you had that in you
back there that was pretty impressive
i know
i know
so flynn where are you from
whoa sorry blondie
i dont do backstory
however i am becoming
very interested in yours
i know im not supposed
to mention the hair
nope
or the mother
uhuh
im too scared to ask about the frog
chameleon
nuance
heres my question though
if you want to see the lanterns so badly
why havent you gone before
well
flynn
rider
run run
whos that
they dont like me
whos that
they dont like me either
whos that
lets assume that everyone in here
doesnt like me
here
i waited a long time for this
oh mama
i have got to get me one of these
you should know that this
is the strangest thing ive ever done
how about two out of three
flynn look out
you should see your faces
because you look
ridiculous
come on blondie jump
its no use i cant see anything
hey theres no point
its pitchblack down there
this is all my fault
she was right
i never should have done this
im so sorry flynn
eugene
what
my real name is eugene fitzherbert
someone might as well know
i have magic hair
that glows when i sing
what
i have magic hair that glows
when i sing
flower gleam and glow
let your power shine
we made it
her hair glows
were alive im alive
i didnt see that coming
the hair actually glows
why does her hair glow
eugene
what
it doesnt just glow
why is he smiling at me
ill kill him ill kill that rider
well cut him off at the kingdom
and get back the crown come on
or
perhaps you want to stop
acting like wild dogs
chasing their tails
and think for a moment
oh please theres no need for that
well if thats all you desire
then be on your way
i was going to offer you something
worth 1000 crowns
would have made you
rich beyond belief
and that wasnt even the best part
oh well cest la vie enjoy your crown
whats the best part
it comes with revenge on flynn rider
youre being strangely cryptic
as you wrap your magic hair
around my injured hand
sorry
just dont dont freak out
flower gleam and glow
let your power shine
make the clock reverse
bring back what once was mine
heal what has been hurt
change the fates design
save what has been lost
bring back what once was mine
what once was mine
please dont freak out
im not freaking out
are you freaking out
im just interested in your hair
and the magical qualities it possesses
how long has it been
doing that exactly
forever i guess
mother says when i was a baby
people tried to cut it
they wanted to take it for themselves
but once its cut
it turns brown and loses its power
a gift like that it has to be protected
thats why mother never let me
thats why i never left and
you never left that tower
and youre still going to go back
no yes
its complicated
so eugene fitzherbert huh
ah yeah well
ill spare you the sob story
of poor orphan eugene fitzherbert
its a little bit of a downer
there was this book i used to read
every night to all the younger kids
the tales of flynnagan rider
swashbuckling rogue richest man
alive not bad with the ladies either
not that hed ever brag about it
of course
was he a thief too
well no
he had enough money to do anything
that he wanted to do
he could go anywhere
that he wanted to go
and for a kid with nothing
i dont know i
just seemed like the better option
you cant tell anyone about this okay
it could ruin my whole reputation
we wouldnt want that
a fake reputation is all a man has
well i should
i should get some more firewood
for the record i like eugene fitzherbert
much better than flynn rider
then youd be the first but thank you
well i thought hed never leave
mother
hello dear
how did you find me
it was easy really
i just listened for the sound of complete
and utter betrayal and followed that
were going home now
you dont understand
ive been on this incredible journey
and ive seen and learned so much
i even met someone
yes the wanted thief im so proud
come on
mother wait i think
i think he likes me
likes you
please rapunzel thats demented
this is why you never should have left

that youve invented
just proves youre too naive to be here

super strength in my hand
because im not going to lie

maximus

for 18 years
dreaming about what it might feel like
when those lights rise in the sky
what if its not everything
that i dreamed it would be

and what if it is what do i do then
thats the good part i guess
you get to go find a new dream

just how blind ive been
now im here blinking in the starlight
now im here suddenly i see
standing here its oh so clear

and its warm and real and bright
and the world has somehow shifted
all at once everything looks different
now that i see you

i should have given it to you before
but i was just scared

all those days
chasing down a daydream
all those years living in a blur
all that time never truly seeing
things the way they were
now shes here shining in the starlight

if shes here its crystal clear
im where im meant to go
and at last i see the light
and its like the fog has lifted

rapunzel
eugene
did i ever tell you
ive got a thing for brunettes
well you can imagine
what happened next
the kingdom rejoiced
for their lost princess had returned
the party lasted an entire week and
honestly i dont remember most of it
dreams came true all over the place
that guy went on to become the most
famous concert pianist in the world
if you can believe it
and this guy
he eventually found true love
as for this guy i assume hes happy
hes never told me otherwise
thanks to maximus
crime in the kingdom
disappeared almost overnight
as did most of the apples
pascal never changed
at last rapunzel was home
and she finally had a real family
she was a princess worth waiting for
beloved by all she led her kingdom
with all the grace and wisdom
that her parents did before her
and as for me
i started going by eugene again
stopped thieving
and turned it all around
but i know what the big question is
did rapunzel and i ever get married
im pleased to tell you
that after years and years
of asking and asking and asking
