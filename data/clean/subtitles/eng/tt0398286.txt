this is the story of a girl
named rapunzel 
and it starts with the sun 
once upon a time  a single drop
of sunlight fell from the heavens 
and from this small drop of sun
grew a magic golden flower 
it had the ability to heal
the sick and injured 
you see that old woman over there 
you might want to remember her 
she s kind of important 
centuries passed
and a hop  skip and a boat ride away
there grew a kingdom 
the kingdom was ruled
by a beloved king and queen 
and the queen
was about to have a baby 
but she got sick 
really sick 
she was running out of time 
and that s when people
start to look for a miracle 
or in this case  a magic golden flower 
i told you she d be important 
instead of sharing the sun s gift 
this woman  mother gothel 
hoarded its healing power
and used it to keep herself young
for hundreds of years 
and all she had to do
was sing a special song 
flower  gleam and glow
let your power shine
make the clock reverse
bring back what once was mine
what once was mine
you get the gist  she sings to it 
she turns young  creepy  right 
we found it 
the magic of the golden flower
healed the queen 
a healthy baby girl  a princess
was born  with beautiful golden hair 
i ll give you a hint  that s rapunzel 
to celebrate her birth 
the king and queen
launched a flying lantern into the sky 
and for that one moment 
everything was perfect 
and then that moment ended 
flower  gleam and glow
let your power shine
make the clock   
gothel broke into the castle 
stole the child 
and just like that  gone 
the kingdom searched and searched 
but they could not find the princess 
for deep within the forest 
in a hidden tower 
gothel raised the child as her own 
save what has been lost
bring back what once was mine
what once was mine
gothel had found
her new magic flower 
but this time 
she was determined to keep it hidden 
why can t i go outside 
the outside world is a dangerous place 
filled with horrible  selfish people 
you must stay here  where you re safe 
do you understand  flower 
yes  mommy 
but the walls of that tower
could not hide everything 
each year  on her birthday 
the king and queen released
thousands of lanterns into the sky
in hope that one day
their lost princess would return 
well  i guess
pascal s not hiding out here 
gotcha 
that s 22 for me 
how about 23 out of 45 
okay  well  what do you want to do 
yeah  i don t think so 
i like it in here  and so do you 
come on  pascal 
it s not so bad in there 
seven a m   the usual morning lineup
start on the chores
and sweep till the floor s all clean
polish and wax  do laundry
and mop and shine up
sweep again and by then it s  like  7 15
and so i ll read a book
or maybe two or three
i ll add a few new paintings
to my gallery
i ll play guitar and knit
and cook and basically
just wonder when will my life begin 
then after lunch it s puzzles
and darts and baking
papier mâché  a bit of ballet and chess
pottery and ventriloquy  candle making
then i ll stretch  maybe sketch
take a climb  sew a dress
and i ll reread the books
if i have time to spare
i ll paint the walls some more
i m sure there s room somewhere
and then i ll brush and brush
and brush and brush my hair
stuck in the same place
i ve always been
and i ll keep wondering and wondering
and wondering and wondering
when will my life begin 
tomorrow night
the lights will appear
just like they do
on my birthday each year
what is it like
out there where they glow
now that i m older
mother might just let me go
wow  i could get used
to a view like this 
rider  come on 
hold on  yep  i m used to it 
guys  i want a castle 
we do this job 
you can buy your own castle 
  hay fever 
  yeah 
wait  hey  wait 
can t you picture me in a castle
of my own  because i certainly can 
all the things we ve seen 
and it s only 8 00 in the morning 
gentlemen  this is a very big day 
this is it  this is a very big day  pascal 
i m finally going to do it 
i m going to ask her 
rapunzel

one moment  mother 
i have a big surprise

i brought back parsnips  i m going
to make hazelnut soup for dinner 
your favourite  surprise 
well  mother 
there s something i want to tell you 
oh  rapunzel  you know i hate
leaving you after a fight 
especially when i ve done
absolutely nothing wrong 
i ve been thinking a lot
about what you said earlier 
i hope you re not still talking
about the stars 
 floating lights  
and  yes  i m leading up to that 
because i really thought
we dropped the issue  sweetheart 
no  mother  i m just saying 
you think i m not strong enough
to handle myself out there 
i know you re not strong enough
to handle yourself out there 
  but if you just   
  we re done talking about this 
  trust me  i know what i m   
  rapunzel 
  oh  come on 
  enough with the lights 
you are not leaving this tower  ever 
great  now i m the bad guy 
all i was going to say  mother  is that   
i know what i want for my birthday now 
and what is that 
new paint 
the paint made from the white shells
you once brought me 
that is a very long trip  rapunzel 
almost three days  time 
i just thought it was a better idea
than the stars 
you ll be all right on your own 
i know i m safe as long as i m here 
i ll be back in three days  time 
i love you very much  dear 
i love you more 
i love you most 
okay 
is this hair 
struggling    struggling is pointless 
i know why you re here 
and i m not afraid of you 
what 
who are you 
and how did you find me 
who are you  and how did you find me 
i know not who you are 
nor how i came to find you 
but may i just say   
hi 
how you doing 
the name s flynn rider 
how s your day going 
who else knows my location 
flynn rider 
  all right  blondie 
  rapunzel 
gesundheit  here s the deal 
i was in a situation 
gallivanting through the forest 
i came across your tower and   
where is my satchel 
i ve hidden it 
somewhere you ll never find it 
it s in that pot  isn t it 
would you stop that 
now it s hidden
where you ll never find it 
so  what do you want with my hair 
to cut it 
  what 
  sell it 
no  listen  the only thing
i want to do with your hair
is to get out of it  literally 
wait  you don t want my hair 
why on earth would i want your hair 
look  i was being chased 
i saw a tower  i climbed it 
  end of story 
  you re telling the truth 
yes 
i know  i need someone to take me 
i think he s telling the truth  too 
he doesn t have fangs 
but what choice do i have 
okay  flynn rider 
i m prepared to offer you a deal 
  deal 
  look this way 
do you know what these are 
you mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess 
lanterns  i knew they weren t stars 
well  tomorrow evening 
they will light the night sky
with these lanterns 
you will act as my guide 
take me to these lanterns 
and return me home safely 
then  and only then 
will i return your satchel to you 
that is my deal 
yeah 
no can do 
unfortunately the kingdom and i
aren t exactly simpatico at the moment 
so i won t be taking you anywhere 
something brought you here 
flynn rider 
call it what you will 
  fate  destiny   
  a horse 
so i have made the decision
to trust you 
a horrible decision  really 
but trust me when i tell you this 
you can tear this tower apart
brick by brick 
but without my help  you will never find
your precious satchel 
let me get this straight 
i take you to see the lanterns 
bring you back home 
and you ll give me back my satchel 
i promise 
and when i promise something 
i never  ever break that promise 
ever 
all right  listen 
i didn t want to have to do this 
but you leave me no choice 
here comes the smoulder 
this is kind of an off day for me 
this doesn t normally happen 
fine  i ll take you to see the lanterns 
really 
oops 
you broke my smoulder 
are you coming  blondie 
look at the world so close
and i m halfway to it
look at it all so big
do i even dare
look at me  there at last
i just have to do it
should i  no
here i go
just smell the grass  the dirt
just like i dreamed they d be
just feel that summer breeze
the way it s calling me
for  like  the first time ever
i m completely free
i could go running and racing
and dancing and chasing
and leaping and bounding
hair flying  heart pounding
and splashing and reeling
and finally feeling
that s when my life begins
i can t believe i did this 
i can t believe i did this 
i can t believe i did this 
mother would be so furious 
but that s okay  what she doesn t know
won t kill her  right 
oh  my gosh  this would kill her 
this is so fun 
i am a horrible daughter 
i m going back 
i am never going back 
i am a despicable human being 
best day ever 
you know 
i can t help but notice you seem
a little at war with yourself here 
  what 
  i m only picking up bits and pieces 
overprotective mother 
forbidden road trip  this is serious stuff 
but let me ease your conscience 
this is part of growing up 
a little rebellion  a little adventure 
that s good  healthy  even 
you think 
i know  you re way over thinking this 
trust me 
does your mother deserve it  no 
would this break her heart
and crush her soul  of course 
but you ve got to do it 
 break her heart  
  in half 
  crush her soul  
like a grape 
she would be heartbroken  you re right 
i am  aren t i  oh  bother 
all right  i can t believe i m saying this 
but i m letting you out of the deal 
  what 
  that s right  but don t thank me 
let s turn around and get you home 
here s your pan  here s your frog 
i get back my satchel 
you get back a mother daughter
relationship based on mutual trust 
and voilà 
we part ways as unlikely friends 
no  i am seeing those lanterns 
oh  come on  what is it going to take
for me to get my satchel back 
i will use this 
is it ruffians  thugs 
have they come for me 
stay calm  it can probably smell fear 
sorry  guess i m just a little bit jumpy 
probably be best if we avoid ruffians
and thugs  though 
yeah  that would probably be best 
are you hungry 
i know a great place for lunch 
where 
don t you worry 
you ll know it when you smell it 
a palace horse 
where s your rider 
rapunzel 
rapunzel  let down your hair 
i know it s around here somewhere 
ah  there it is  the snuggly duckling 
don t worry  very quaint place 
perfect for you 
don t want you scaring and giving up
on this whole endeavour now  do we 
  well  i do like ducklings 
  yay 
garcon  your finest table  please 
you smell that 
take a deep breath through the nose 
really let that seep in 
what are you getting 
to me  it s part man smell and the other
part is really bad man smell 
i don t know why  but overall it smells
like the colour brown  your thoughts 
that s a lot of hair 
she s growing it out 
is that blood in your moustache 
goldie  look at all the blood
in his moustache 
good sir  that s a lot of blood 
you don t look so good  blondie  maybe
we should get you home  call it a day 
probably better off 
this is a five star joint 
if you can t handle this place  maybe
you should be back in your tower 
is this you 
  now they re just being mean 
  it s him  all right 
greno  go find some guards 
that reward
is going to buy me a new hook 
  i could use the money 
  what about me  i m broke 
get back 
  mine 
  ruffians  stop 
  we can work this out 
  leave him alone 
gentlemen  please 
give me back my guide  ruffians 
not the nose  not the nose 
put him down 
i don t know where i am  and i need him
to take me to see the lanterns
because i ve been dreaming about them
my entire life 
find your humanity 
haven t any of you ever had a dream 
i had a dream once 
i m malicious  mean and scary
my sneer could curdle dairy
and violence wise
my hands are not the cleanest
but despite my evil look
and my temper and my hook
i ve always yearned
to be a concert pianist
can t you see me on the stage
performing mozart
tickling the ivories till they gleam
yep  i d rather be called deadly
for my killer show tune medley
thank you 
 cause way down deep inside
i ve got a dream
he s got a dream
he s got a dream
see  i ain t as cruel and vicious
as i seem
though i do like breaking femurs
you can count me with the dreamers
like everybody else i ve got a dream
i ve got scars and lumps and bruises
plus something here that oozes
and let s not even mention
my complexion
but despite my extra toes
and my goitre and my nose
i really want to make a love connection
can t you see me
with a special little lady 
rowing in a rowboat down the stream
though i m one disgusting blighter
i m a lover not a fighter
 cause way down deep inside
i ve got a dream
  i ve got a dream
  he s got a dream
  i ve got a dream
  he s got a dream
and i know one day
romance will reign supreme
though my face
leaves people screaming
there s a child behind it dreaming
like everybody else  i ve got a dream
thor would like to quit and be a florist
gunther does interior design
  ulf is into mime
  attila s cupcakes are sublime
bruiser knits  killer sews
fang does little puppet shows
and vladimir collects ceramic unicorns
  what about you 
  i m sorry  me 
what s your dream 
no  no  no  sorry  boys  i don t sing 
i have dreams like you
no  really
just much less touchy feely
they mainly happen
somewhere warm and sunny
on an island that i own
tanned and rested and alone
surrounded by enormous
piles of money
  i ve got a dream
  she s got a dream
  i ve got a dream
  she s got a dream
i just want to see
the floating lanterns gleam
and with every passing hour
i m so glad i left my tower
like all you lovely folks
i ve got a dream
she s got a dream
he s got a dream
they ve got a dream
we ve got a dream
so our differences
ain t really that extreme
we re one big team
  call us brutal
  sick
  sadistic
  and grotesquely optimistic
 cause way down deep inside
we ve got a dream
  i ve got a dream
  i ve got a dream
yes  way down deep inside
i ve got a dream
i found the guards 
where s rider  where is he 
i know he s in here somewhere 
find him 
turn the place upside down
if you have to 
go  live your dream 
  i will 
  your dream stinks 
i was talking to her 
thanks for everything 
i believe
this is the man you re looking for 
you got me 
sir  there s no sign of rider 
maximus 
what s he doing 
a passage  come on  men  let s go 
conli  make sure those boys
don t get away 
play it safe
or go get the crown 
i got a dream
i got some dreams
somebody get me a glass 
because i just found me
a tall drink of water 
oh  stop it  you big lug 
where does that tunnel let out 
knife 
i didn t know you had that in you
back there  that was pretty impressive 
i know 
i know 
so    flynn  where are you from 
whoa  sorry  blondie 
i don t do back story 
however  i am becoming
very interested in yours 
i know i m not supposed
to mention the hair 
  nope 
  or the mother 
  uh uh 
  i m too scared to ask about the frog 
  chameleon 
  nuance 
here s my question  though 
if you want to see the lanterns so badly
why haven t you gone before 
well   
flynn 
rider 
run  run 
  who s that 
  they don t like me 
  who s that 
  they don t like me either 
who s that 
let s assume that everyone in here
doesn t like me 
here 
i waited a long time for this 
oh  mama 
i have got to get me one of these 
you should know that this
is the strangest thing i ve ever done 
how about two out of three 
flynn  look out 
you should see your faces 
because you look   
   ridiculous 
come on  blondie  jump 
it s no use  i can t see anything 
hey  there s no point 
it s pitch black down there 
this is all my fault 
she was right 
i never should have done this 
i m so sorry  flynn 
eugene 
what 
my real name is eugene fitzherbert 
someone might as well know 
i have magic hair
that glows when i sing 
what 
i have magic hair that glows
when i sing 
flower gleam and glow
let your power shine
we made it 
  her hair glows 
  we re alive  i m alive 
i didn t see that coming 
the hair actually glows 
  why does her hair glow 
  eugene 
what 
it doesn t just glow 
why is he smiling at me 
i ll kill him  i ll kill that rider 
we ll cut him off at the kingdom
and get back the crown  come on 
or   
perhaps you want to stop
acting like wild dogs
chasing their tails
and think for a moment 
oh  please  there s no need for that 
well  if that s all you desire 
then be on your way 
i was going to offer you something
worth 1 000 crowns 
would have made you
rich beyond belief 
and that wasn t even the best part 
oh  well  c est la vie  enjoy your crown 
what s the best part 
it comes with revenge on flynn rider 
you re being strangely cryptic
as you wrap your magic hair
around my injured hand 
sorry 
just don t    don t freak out 
flower  gleam and glow
let your power shine
make the clock reverse
bring back what once was mine
heal what has been hurt
change the fates  design
save what has been lost
bring back what once was mine
what once was mine
please don t freak out 
i m not freaking out 
are you freaking out 
i m just interested in your hair
and the magical qualities it possesses 
how long has it been
doing that exactly 
forever  i guess 
mother says when i was a baby 
people tried to cut it 
they wanted to take it for themselves 
but once it s cut 
it turns brown and loses its power 
a gift like that  it has to be protected 
that s why mother never let me   
that s why i never left and   
you never left that tower 
and you re still going to go back 
no  yes 
it s complicated 
so  eugene fitzherbert  huh 
ah  yeah  well   
i ll spare you the sob story
of poor orphan eugene fitzherbert 
it s a little bit of a downer 
there was this book i used to read
every night to all the younger kids 
the tales of flynnagan rider 
swashbuckling rogue  richest man
alive  not bad with the ladies either 
not that he d ever brag about it 
of course 
was he a thief  too 
well  no 
he had enough money to do anything
that he wanted to do 
he could go anywhere
that he wanted to go 
and for a kid with nothing 
i don t know  i   
just seemed like the better option 
you can t tell anyone about this  okay 
it could ruin my whole reputation 
we wouldn t want that 
a fake reputation is all a man has 
well  i should   
i should get some more firewood 
for the record  i like eugene fitzherbert
much better than flynn rider 
then you d be the first  but thank you 
well  i thought he d never leave 
mother 
hello  dear 
how did you find me 
it was easy  really 
i just listened for the sound of complete
and utter betrayal and followed that 
  we re going home  now 
  you don t understand 
i ve been on this incredible journey 
and i ve seen and learned so much 
i even met someone 
yes  the wanted thief  i m so proud 
come on 
mother  wait  i think   
i think he likes me 
likes you 
please  rapunzel  that s demented 
this is why you never should have left
dear  this whole romance
that you ve invented
just proves you re too naive to be here
why would he like you 
come on now  really
look at you 
you think that he s impressed 
don t be a dummy  come with mummy
mother   
no 
no 
oh  i see how it is
rapunzel knows best
rapunzel s so mature now
such a clever grown up miss
rapunzel knows best
fine  if you re so sure now
  go ahead  then give him this 
  how did you   
this is why he s here
don t let him deceive you
give it to him  watch  you ll see
i will 
trust me  my dear
that s how fast he ll leave you
i won t say i told you so
no  rapunzel knows best
so  if he s such a dreamboat
go and put him to the test
mother  wait 
if he s lying  don t come crying
mother knows best
so  can i ask you something 
is there any chance that i m going to get
super strength in my hand 
because i m not going to lie 
that would be stupendous 
hey  you all right 
sorry  yes  just lost in thought  i guess 
here s the thing 
superhuman good looks 
i ve always had them  born with it 
but superhuman strength  can you
imagine the possibilities of this 
patience  boys 
all good things to those who wait 
well  i hope you re here to apologise 
no  put me down  stop it  no 
let me go 
give me him 
stop  stop  stop 
easy  boy  easy  settle down 
easy  boy  easy 
easy 
that s it 
now sit 
sit 
  what 
  now drop the boot 
drop it 
you re such a good boy  yes  you are 
you all tired from chasing this bad man
all over the place 
  excuse me 
  nobody appreciates you  do they 
do they 
oh  come on  he s a bad horse 
oh  he s nothing but a big sweetheart 
isn t that right   
maximus 
you ve got to be kidding me 
look  today is kind of
the biggest day of my life 
and the thing is 
i need you not to get him arrested 
just for 24 hours 
and then you can chase each other
to your heart s content 
and it s also my birthday 
just so you know 
excuse me  sorry 
thank you 
it s for the lost princess 
to the boats 
hey  max 
what  i bought them 
most of them 
where are we going 
best day of your life 
i figured you should have a decent seat 
you okay 
i m terrified 
why 
i ve been looking out a window
for 18 years 
dreaming about what it might feel like
when those lights rise in the sky 
what if it s not everything
that i dreamed it would be 
it will be 
and what if it is  what do i do then 
that s the good part  i guess 
you get to go find a new dream 
all those days
watching from the windows
all those years  outside looking in
all that time  never even knowing
just how blind i ve been
now i m here  blinking in the starlight
now i m here  suddenly i see
standing here  it s  oh  so clear
i m where i m meant to be
and at last i see the light
and it s like the fog has lifted
and at last i see the light
and it s like the sky is new
and it s warm and real and bright
and the world has somehow shifted
all at once  everything looks different
now that i see you
i have something for you  too 
i should have given it to you before 
but i was just scared 
and the thing is  i m not scared
any more  you know what i mean 
i m starting to 
all those days
chasing down a daydream
all those years  living in a blur
all that time  never truly seeing
things the way they were
now she s here  shining in the starlight
now she s here  suddenly i know
if she s here  it s crystal clear
i m where i m meant to go
and at last i see the light
and it s like the fog has lifted
and at last i see the light
and it s like the sky is new
and it s warm and real and bright
and the world has somehow shifted
all at once  everything is different
now that i see you
now that i   
see you
is everything okay 
oh  yes 
yes  of course  i just   
i m sorry  everything is fine 
there s just something
i have to take care of 
okay 
i ll be right back 
it s all right  pascal

rapunzel

to get away from you 
but if you let me save him 
i will go with you

just let me heal him
and you and i will be together 
forever  just like you want 
everything will be the way it was

in case you get any ideas
about following us

you were my new dream 
and you were mine 
heal what has been hurt

save what has been lost
bring back what once was mine
what once was mine
rapunzel 
eugene 
did i ever tell you
i ve got a thing for brunettes 
well  you can imagine
what happened next 
the kingdom rejoiced 
for their lost princess had returned 
the party lasted an entire week  and
honestly i don t remember most of it 
dreams came true all over the place 
that guy went on to become the most
famous concert pianist in the world 
if you can believe it 
and this guy 
he eventually found true love 
as for this guy  i assume he s happy 
he s never told me otherwise 
thanks to maximus 
crime in the kingdom
disappeared almost overnight 
as did most of the apples 
pascal never changed 
at last rapunzel was home 
and she finally had a real family 
she was a princess worth waiting for 
beloved by all  she led her kingdom
with all the grace and wisdom
that her parents did before her 
and  as for me 
i started going by eugene again 
stopped thieving
and turned it all around 
but i know what the big question is 
did rapunzel and i ever get married 
i m pleased to tell you
that after years and years
of asking and asking and asking
