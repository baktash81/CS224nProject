important enterprise under god 
the unification of
this great country of ours
by iron rail 
  hear  hear 
to the comanche 
i say you have nothing to fear 
as long as there is peace between us
all land treaties shall be honoured 
but to the outlaw

make no mistake  law and order
has come to the wild west

notorious outlaw and indian killer 
butch cavendish here

just to win a bet 
hell  he did 
which is it  dan 
don t see how it makes a difference 
what s the matter with him 
it s not cavendish he s worried about 
like daniel
entering the lion s den

this godless land
of the poisons of sin and licentiousness 
hallelujah 
dear god  grant us
thy mercy and wise judgment

to the full extent of the law

at the station any minute 
get the horses  come on 
jesus  we ought to go 
that s reinforced bethlehem steel 
any attempts at escape is futile 
that s great 
good job 
and for coming to the aid
of a federal prosecutor 
i can be sure to put in
a good word with the judge 
come on  boys 
put your backs into it 
the rail road waits for no man 
that s the end of the line 
we jump 
what about the passengers

windigo getting away

and we ll settle this like men 
although  i warn you 
i boxed in law school 
huh 
great warrior 
yeah  that s my brother 
nice suit 
we have to stop the train 
no time 
must to jump 
i m not leaving
these passengers 
then help me unhook the cars 
come on 
it s jammed  give me a hand 
you hold 
whoa 
john 
what the   
ugh 
hey  hold it right there 
i m afraid i have to take you in 
do you hear me 
you speak english  don t you 
halt 
by the authority granted to me
by the state of texas 
i m hereby arresting you 
you all right there  little brother 
fine 
just taking this man into custody 
uh huh 
he was on that train for a reason  dan 
probably 
what s your crime  boy 
indian 
and a man  in the eyes of the law 
now  throw me your cuffs 
whatever you say  little brother 
  it s nothing personal 
dan 
john 
they said there was an accident
and someone fell off the train 
actually  it was me 
dan s fine 
saved the day  same as usual 
oh  my god  your face 
um   
come here 
god  it s good to see you 
what s it been  nine years 
eight  since you stopped writing 
we were just kids back then 
well  he takes good care of you  i see 
yeah  in his way 
he spends most his time
in indian territory these days 
indian territory 
doesn t sound like dan 
doing what 
well  whatever it is 
he doesn t talk to me about it 
so   
have you got a place to stay 
no  not as yet 
well  you should stay
with us at willow creek 
i don t know 
oh  god  look at you 
city boy 
why would you ever want
to come back here 
it s my home 
who are you 
danny  this is your uncle john 
why  you look
just like your dad did
when he was your age 
they re going out again 
he deserves a trial  dan 
two rangers are dead 
didn t get no trial 
well  i m coming with you 
the law looks a lot different
on the ground  little brother 
well  it doesn t include vengeance 
no matter where you re standing 
for  wherever men unite into society 
 they must quit the laws
of nature and assume    
 and assume the laws of men 
 so that society as a whole
may prosper  
that s john locke s
treatises of government 
never thought to hear
the likes of it in colby 
mr cole  my brother john 
new county prosecutor 
latham cole  it s an honour  sir 
i read about you during the war 
john  here 
is an educated man like yourself 
well  let s try not to
hold that against him 
you going after cavendish 
collins  here  picked up a trail 
  used to track for our father 
  can he ride 
well enough 
yeah  well  you see to it 
railroad promised
these people a hanging 
i didn t know the rail road
was in the business
of keeping promises 
a simple task 
collect the prisoner 
deliver him to his execution 
if you re not up to that  mr reid 
i ll find someone who is 
maybe you should think
about staying in town for a few days 
comanche are restless 
they re always restless 
but they keep to their side of the river 
and i keep to mine 
besides  fences won t
put themselves up 
it s my job 
i m not asking you to be happy about it 
i am happy 
i m happy with the life
you provide  i just   
is that new 
matches your eyes 
all right 
now  i expect you
to be bagging squirrels
by the time i get back 
like old times  huh 
thank you 
all right  mr prosecutor 
let s see how your due process
fares on the trail 
it s dad s 
i hereby deputise you a texas ranger 
but i can t help you with them clothes 
indians call that your spirit horse 
come to take you to the other side 
you can t scare me
with your ghost stories any more  dan 
since when did you start
wearing indian jewellery  anyway 
since my kid brother became a lawyer 
yeah 
world needs lawyers
same as it does rangers 
i reckon so  it s a nice hat  by the way 
they didn t have a bigger one 
he missed you 
could have fooled me 
you smell like a distillery already 
steadies the hand 
you even sleep last night 
you know me  johnny 
never been one
to resist a little western hospitality 
 red s   hmm 
what s this  like  dancing 
yeah 
dancing 
could go by the flats 
lose a day  maybe a day and a half 
what is it 
no cover 
what do you figure  dan 
figure collins should go take a look 
if he can stay in the saddle 
john  come here 
no  i don t believe in them 
you know that 
butch cavendish don t care
one way or the other 
i ll take my chances 
you stay close 
come on 
where the hell s collins 
ambush 
  i can t see him 
i got no shot 
ride  ride 
dan 
ride  ride out 
your hand  john  give me your hand 
  no  no 
no  dan  dan 
no  no  no   
you shouldn t have come back  john 
no  it s okay  it s okay

all heart  ain t you 
a year you took from me
in that sweatbox 
you take something from me 
be damn sure
i m gonna take something from you 
oh  yes 
deal dies with you  old friend 
that s not right 
it can t be right 
they re dead  all dead 
even dan 
dan very dead 
but he s the lone ranger 
would have been much easier  i agree 
how did you get out of jail  anyway 
hmm 
and would you stop feeding that bird 
it s not alive  you know 
awaiting spirit to return 
not same thing 
hmm 
greetings  noble spirit horse 
no  no  no  no  please 
you make mistake 
half wit 
  wet brain 
you come 
come  come

  great warrior 
spirit horse
you have travelled far 
obviously very fatigued 
i understand 
you come  come  come 
   come  come 
him strong brother 
  want him  bring him back 
john  give me your hand 
rebecca 
john 
if you are going to
sneak up on an indian 
best to do it downwind 
why are you talking to that horse 
my grandfather spoke
of a time when animals could speak 
when you get them alone  some still do 
but i cannot decide
whether this horse is stupid 
or pretending to be stupid 
tricky 
why am i covered in dirt 
because i buried you 
then why am i alive 
horse says you are spirit walker 
a man who has been to the other side 
and returned 
a man
who cannot be killed in battle 
horse definitely stupid 
are those my boots 
he cut out his heart 
what kind of a man
does something like that 
not a man 
an evil spirit
born in the empty spaces of the desert 
with a hunger
that cannot be satisfied 
and the power
to throw nature out of balance 
my people call this spirit  windigo  
i am tonto of the comanche 
last of the windigo hunters 
so  what do you want with me 
a vision told me a great warrior
and spirit walker
would help me on my quest 
i would have preferred someone else 
your brother  perhaps 
he would have been good 
but who am i to question
the great father  hmm 
all i know is a man killed my brother 
and i ll see him hang for it 
then you will need this 
a bullet 
mmm 
a silver bullet 
silver made him what he is 
and so it will return him to the earth 
right 
you know what 
i would like to thank you
for everything that you ve done for me 
but i should get back 
i  too 
seek the windigo butch cavendish 
good 
i was prisoner on the train
the way a coyote stalks buffalo 
after hunting 26 years i had my prey
until you interfere 
actually  i think i saved your life 
so  we re even 
ow 
what the hell was that for 
bird angry 
yeah  you know what 
i can t help you 
or your bird 
where do you go 
into town  to form a posse 
i would not do that  kemosabe 
yeah 
there was a gun
waiting for cavendish on the train 
eight men rode into canyon 
i dig seven graves 
collins 
he s known us since we were kids 
you find traitor 
you find the man who killed your brother 
that s my brother s vest 
eyes  cut by the bullets that killed him 
from the great beyond 
he will protect you
and the ones you love 
you want me to wear a mask 
the men you seek
think you are dead  kemosabe 
better to stay that way 
all right  but if we ride together 
it s to bring these men to justice
in a court of law 
is that understood 
justice
is what i seek  kemosabe 
step right up  ladies and gentlemen 
into the hall of human deformities 
fun and educational for you  sir 
   trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored   
god has forsaken all you sinners 
and now the armies of hell are upon us 
heathen  heathen 
heathen in our midst 
heathen 
i m looking for a man 
i bet 
got money 
of course 
where did you get that 
make trade 
with a dead man 
hard bargain 
so   
are all these women professionals 
sickness of greed is strong 
what about her 
oh  yes  her  too 
so how do you know all this 
a vision said it would be so 
hmm 
hi  tonto 
couple of freaks here to see you 
mmm hmm  thank you  homer 
just let me do the talking 
ma am 
what s with the mask 
second thought  don t answer that 
no  one thing you learn in my business 
killers  preachers 
war heroes  railroaders   
every man has his thing 
railroaders 
are you referring to mr cole 
oh  no  not mr cole  no 
by all reports  mr cole is  uh   
well  he is no longer guided
by the same imperatives as other men 
mr cole gelding 
come to think of it  there was talk
of an incident during the war 
let go of me 
  i won t let you go 
  whoa 
no free rides  gentlemen 
scrimshaw 
ivory 
  i want to touch 
  uh uh 
not if you favour your hand 
we re looking for a man named collins 
he s a tracker  speaks indian 
never heard of him 
i see 
well   
coming in here 
we did happen to notice a number
of fairly serious health code violations 
hmm 
it is a house of sin 
yes  well  one with evidence
of livestock on the premises 
inadequately marked fire escapes 
and a fairly sinister looking
jar of pickles on the bar 
hmm  pickles 
unrefrigerated 
i d hate to have to shut you down 
you want to shut down the rail road 
  yes 
  no 
  yes 
  well  then you have a problem 
because there ain t no rail road
without girls like mine
doing the heavy lifting 
homer  help these morons find the door 
windigo getting away 
what the hell is he talking about 
nothing  it s an indian thing 
man who has taste for human flesh 
butch cavendish 
that s right 
well  why didn t you just say so 
collins was in about
a week ago with a lawman

oh  right 
  thank you 
  i m afraid we re gonna have to
bring our little visit to a close 
some of my clientele don t take kindly
to an indian on the premises 
he has as much right
to be here as anyone else 
not since the comanche
violated the treaty 
  treaty

up and down the river

danny  come on

like comanche violate treaty 
that s very helpful  thank you 
whoa

and that ridiculous bird 
the woman  rebecca 
you will fill her with child  no

no 
that s my brother s wife 
when you were on the other side 
you spoke of her in your vision 
well  lack of oxygen
can cause the brain to hallucinate 
everyone knows that 
yes 
but you did not speak of her
as the wife of your brother 
well  she s his widow now 
so  it is better that
she live the rest of her life alone 
yes  no 
look  it just isn t done 
you wouldn t understand 
because i am a savage 
would you stop 
you can t track 
if you could  we wouldn t be
out here in the first place 
what is that 
track 
that s impossible 
train track 
you are lost  aren t you 
train tracks 
i thought you were in indian territory 
yes 
let the comanche make no mistake 
we will not be dissuaded from our task 
   from here on 
all treaties with the indian nation
are null and void 
we will be in promontory summit
ahead of schedule 
three days from today 
now  go ahead  put that in your paper 
mr cole  mr cole 
sir 
it arrived last night

attack the settlements 
white man does not know this 
but you re going to tell them 
i mean  you did tell them  right

raid those settlements 
if you let me go  i can prove it

mmm

me  spirit walker
from great beyond 
the hunter of wendingo
  and the other things 
sunstroke 
or his mind is poisoned with whiskey 
comanche gesture of respect 
what s with the mask 
what 
tonto told you these things 
that s right 
and he told you to wear the mask 
that s funny 
very funny 
tonto s a comanche 
he s one of you 
no more 
what do you mean 
his mind is broken 
he is a band apart 
many moons ago 
a boy found two white men
in the desert 
he brought them to
his village to be healed 
when they found silver in the river 
they asked the boy where it came from 
in exchange for a cheap pocket watch
from sears roebuck 
the boy showed them
where the river begins 
where they found more silver
than any white man had ever seen 
they took what they could carry 
but they wanted to
keep the place a secret 
so they could one day return 
the boy could not live
with what he had done 
so he decided the men were possessed
by evil spirits in the silver 
he called it  windigo  
like the ghost stories
we tell our children 
and he made a vow 
when he found these two men 
he would drain their blood
into the soil of his ancestors 
so he could return to the tribe

our time has passed

there s no such thing as a wendingo 
you made it up

you sold out your whole village

a messed up little kid

shut up 
hey

your tactics
have been most effective  captain 
with the natives in retreat 
we ll be in promontory summit
ahead of schedule 
believe me  what they have done to the
settlements we have given back tenfold 
tenfold 
danny  i told you 
take it easy on the corners
and press down on the straightaway 
it s just a toy 
come here  danny 
i want to show you something 
since the time of alexander the great
no man has travelled faster
than the horse that carried him 
not any more 
imagine  an entire continent
connected by iron rail 
that s fuel for our cities 
metals for our factories 
food for the masses 
whoever controls this 
controls the future 
power that makes emperors and kings
look like fools 
you mean it s mine 
it could be  son 
could be all yours 
rebecca  feeling better 
look what mr cole got me  mama 
huh 
danny   
oh 
well  it was the least i could do
after what you ve been through 
you should consider yourself
a lucky woman  mrs reid 
had mr cole not
come along when he did
with those outlaws 
who knows what manner
of violations might have transpired   
captain  captain  please 
the boy 
we re indebted to you 
oh  no  it is i who is indebted 
ever since the war  i prayed
that god might send me
a family that i could care for 
and now he has 
wait 
there s one left 
  i m sorry 
  a ranger 
a ranger is still alive 
no  ma am 
my troopers found seven graves 
so  perhaps when you fell
and hit your head   
captain 
if there is a ranger still alive 
we will scour the countryside
until we find him 
i promise you that 
heavenly father 
we call upon you in this 
our hour of need 
for you are the shepherd
that shall guide the wanderer
through the desert 
you are the light
that shall be his beacon
in the darkness 
and yours is the mighty sword
that shall strike down his enemies 
for he is on the path of righteousness 
amen 
latham cole 
sir 
someone s coming in 
sentries 
at your posts 
  daddy 
  dan 
we don t know who s out there 
i intend to find out 
latham cole 
wendell  take mrs reid
and her son to the supply car 
for their own safety 
what is it  friend 
this is the man you ve been looking for 
butch cavendish 
just like one of those great lizards
buried in the desert 
the last of a dying breed 
that s enough 
i brought this man in for justice 
of course 
soldier 
i m just doing my job  mrs reid 
you wanna keep me in this room 
you re gonna have to shoot me 
is that part of your job 
whoa 
danny 
and don t let him leave 
but he s just a boy 
that s right 
oh 
and he s got a twitchy finger  too 
stupid white man 
there were rumours
that sustained us 
a lone ranger 
a masked man 
a ghost  some people said 
and now  here you are 
flesh and blood 
civilised society
has no place for a masked man 
of course not 
how can i thank you
for what you ve done 
you can stop this war before it s too late 
comanche didn t attack
those settlements 
it was butch cavendish and his gang 
all for this 
butch cavendish 
in one man 
everything i hate about this country 
no sense of the common good 
no vision 
come to think of it 
not unlike your brother  dan 
men like that can t accept
what we know to be true 
a man can t stay the same
with the world evolving around him 
remember me 
but a man can t choose
his brother  can he 
it s almost as if his brother chooses him 
you see  that s what we are 
me and butch 
brothers 
born in the desert 
all those years ago 
and now you ve come back 
train tracks 
that s what dan found
in indian territory  isn t it 
he knew there was gonna be a war
and he wouldn t go along with it 
so you had him killed 
like i said 
no vision 
stop this train 
oh  there s no stopping this train  john 
i think you know that 
danny 
you re not my daddy 
no  put the gun down  son 
where s my daddy 
he s dead  danny 
  he killed him 
  shut up 
listen to me  danny 
you remember me  it s your uncle john 
you trust me  don t you  danny 
look  danny 
i m gonna put my gun away  okay 
nice and slow 
there s nothing to be afraid of 
shoot him  son 
danny 
is my daddy dead 
is he 
is he 
just put the gun down 
please 
now  just put the gun down 
captain  arrest these men 
this man is a common criminal
trespassing on railway property 
comanche never
raided any settlements 
they staged the attacks
so they could violate the treaty 
we ve heard enough  captain 
you represent
the united states government 
you do not work for this man 
  captain 
  they started this war 
well  if what you say is true 
that would mean
i attacked the comanche for no reason 
that s right  captain 
slaughter of the innocents 
their blood on your hands 
tenfold 
are you capable of that 
well  the way i see it 
these men are with the rail road 
so  the question is 
who the hell are you 
clear the track  men 
  outta the way 
going to pit 
my god 
out here  it s just rock 
put it on a train  it s priceless 
what could you buy with all of that 
a country  captain 
a great country 
for which our children will thank us 
take her ahead 
line her up 
you re lined up 
that ll do 
get these chinamen out of here 
move it  move it 
detail  halt 
order  up 
didn t you hear me  chinaman 
i said  get out 
port arms 
please  don t do this 
you ll take care of us  like you said 
you don t have to do this 
load 
i ain t gonna tell you again 
what the hell is that 
gas  that s gas 
  what d he say 
gas  get out of there 
she s going to blow 
shoulder arms 
i was at gettysburg 
twelve thousand casualties
before lunch 
know what i learned in all that carnage 
nothing is accomplished
without sacrifice 
  leave her alone 
  danny 
nice and easy 
gas  oh  lord  gas

gas  gas  gas 
ready 
i m gonna have to
teach you about respect  aren t i  son

blow up the whole mountain 
trust me  these two have
a hard time staying dead 
cover the flank 
mister tonto 
mister tonto 
you mean  they killed all of them 
the indians  the settlers   
dan 
for silver 
you were right 
there is no justice 
cole controls everything 
the rail road  the cavalry 
everything 
if men like him represent the law 
i d rather be an outlaw 
that is why
you wear the mask 
something very wrong with that horse 
ladies and gentlemen 
we are here today to celebrate a dream 
and now i d like to introduce the man
who made that dream a reality 
chairman of the transcontinental
railroad corporation 
mr lewis habberman the third 
thank you 
but i cannot take credit alone 
no  sir 
the working men before you
deserve your applause 
  yes 
as does one man in particular 
and a more dedicated  loyal employee
the rail road could not ask for 
mr latham cole 
  come on 
  good man 
bravo  sir 
mr cole 
a testament of our thanks 
cheers 
you missed something 
where did you get the explosives 
i told you 
no  you didn t 
but you had a plan  i mean 
he didn t get away with it 
we had plan 
it was good plan 
this is a damn bank robbery 
oh  mr habberman 
if you and the other shareholders
would like to follow me 
i have a little surprise for you 
ah 
oh  my 
what was that 
tunnelling for supply routes 
nothing to be concerned about 
this way  gentlemen 
bring the girl 
he s coming for you 
just like frank said 
what you got makes them reid boys
so hot under the collar  anyway 
maybe i ll have a taste and find out 
the men around this table represent
the finest families in our country
as well as controlling interest
in the transcontinental
railway corporation 
hear  hear 
what you cannot know
is that over the past six months 
i have leveraged a position
which will make me
the majority shareholder
when this company is
listed monday morning
on the new york city stock exchange 
in essence  gentlemen  you work for me 
have you lost your mind 
do you have any idea the cost 
each one of those freight cars contains
4 5 tons of purest raw silver 
when it reaches the bank
in san francisco 
that s 65 million dollars 
it s what you might call
a hostile takeover 
you can keep the watch 
have you checked the undercarriage 
  check it again 
  yes  sir 
pleasure to see you  red 
oh

assistance to you  madam
