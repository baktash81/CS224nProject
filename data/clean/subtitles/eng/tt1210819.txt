theyre going out again
he deserves a trial dan
two rangers are dead

well im coming with you
the law looks a lot different
on the ground little brother
well it doesnt include vengeance
no matter where youre standing
for wherever men unite into society
they must quit the laws
of nature and assume
and assume the laws of men
so that society as a whole
may prosper
thats john lockes
treatises of government

the likes of it in colby
mr cole my brother john
new county prosecutor
latham cole its an honour sir
i read about you during the war
john here

well lets try not to
hold that against him
you going after cavendish
collins here picked up a trail
used to track for our father
can he ride
well enough
yeah well you see to it
railroad promised
these people a hanging
i didnt know the rail road
was in the business
of keeping promises
a simple task
collect the prisoner
deliver him to his execution
if youre not up to that mr reid
ill find someone who is
maybe you should think
about staying in town for a few days
comanche are restless
theyre always restless
but they keep to their side of the river
and i keep to mine
besides fences wont
put themselves up
its my job
im not asking you to be happy about it
i am happy
im happy with the life

by the time i get back
like old times huh
thank you

lets see how your due process
fares on the trail
its dads
i hereby deputise you a texas ranger
but i cant help you with them clothes
indians call that your spirit horse

you cant scare me
with your ghost stories any more dan

wearing indian jewellery anyway
since my kid brother became a lawyer

hmm
and would you stop feeding that bird
its not alive you know
awaiting spirit to return
not same thing
hmm
greetings noble spirit horse
no no no no please
you make mistake
halfwit
wet brain

great warrior
spirit horse
you have travelled far
obviously very fatigued
i understand
you come come come
come come
him strong brother
want him bring him back
john give me your hand
rebecca
john
if you are going to
sneak up on an indian
best to do it downwind
why are you talking to that horse
my grandfather spoke
of a time when animals could speak
when you get them alone some still do
but i cannot decide
whether this horse is stupid
or pretending to be stupid
tricky
why am i covered in dirt
because i buried you
then why am i alive
horse says you are spirit walker
a man who has been to the other side
and returned
a man
who cannot be killed in battle
horse definitely stupid
are those my boots
he cut out his heart
what kind of a man
does something like that
not a man
an evil spirit
born in the empty spaces of the desert
with a hunger
that cannot be satisfied
and the power
to throw nature out of balance
my people call this spirit windigo
i am tonto of the comanche
last of the windigo hunters
so what do you want with me
a vision told me a great warrior
and spirit walker
would help me on my quest
i would have preferred someone else
your brother perhaps
he would have been good
but who am i to question
the great father hmm
all i know is a man killed my brother
and ill see him hang for it
then you will need this
a bullet
mmm
a silver bullet
silver made him what he is
and so it will return him to the earth
right
you know what
i would like to thank you
for everything that youve done for me
but i should get back
i too
seek the windigo butch cavendish
good
i was prisoner on the train
the way a coyote stalks buffalo
after hunting 26 years i had my prey
until you interfere
actually i think i saved your life
so were even
ow
what the hell was that for
bird angry
yeah you know what
i cant help you
or your bird
where do you go
into town to form a posse
i would not do that kemosabe
yeah
there was a gun
waiting for cavendish on the train
eight men rode into canyon
i dig seven graves
collins
hes known us since we were kids
you find traitor
you find the man who killed your brother
thats my brothers vest
eyes cut by the bullets that killed him
from the great beyond
he will protect you
and the ones you love
you want me to wear a mask
the men you seek
think you are dead kemosabe
better to stay that way
all right but if we ride together
its to bring these men to justice
in a court of law
is that understood
justice
is what i seek kemosabe
step right up ladies and gentlemen
into the hall of human deformities
fun and educational for you sir
trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored
god has forsaken all you sinners
and now the armies of hell are upon us
heathen heathen
heathen in our midst
heathen
im looking for a man
i bet
got money
of course
where did you get that
make trade
with a dead man
hard bargain
so
are all these women professionals
sickness of greed is strong
what about her
oh yes her too
so how do you know all this
a vision said it would be so
hmm
hi tonto
couple of freaks here to see you
mmmhmm thank you homer
just let me do the talking
maam
whats with the mask
second thought dont answer that
no one thing you learn in my business
killers preachers
war heroes railroaders
every man has his thing
railroaders
are you referring to mr cole
oh no not mr cole no
by all reports mr cole is uh
well he is no longer guided
by the same imperatives as other men
mr cole gelding
come to think of it there was talk
of an incident during the war
let go of me
i wont let you go
whoa

scrimshaw
ivory
i want to touch
uhuh

were looking for a man named collins
hes a tracker speaks indian

i see
well
coming in here
we did happen to notice a number
of fairly serious health code violations
hmm
it is a house of sin
yes well one with evidence
of livestock on the premises
inadequately marked fire escapes
and a fairly sinisterlooking
jar of pickles on the bar
hmm pickles
unrefrigerated
id hate to have to shut you down
you want to shut down the rail road
yes
no
yes
well then you have a problem
because there aint no rail road
without girls like mine
doing the heavy lifting
homer help these morons find the door
windigo getting away

you spoke of her in your vision
well lack of oxygen
can cause the brain to hallucinate
everyone knows that

out here in the first place
what is that

attack the settlements
white man does not know this

there doesnt have to
be a war understand

mmm

me spirit walker
from great beyond
the hunter of wendingo
and the other things
sunstroke
or his mind is poisoned with whiskey
comanche gesture of respect
whats with the mask
what
tonto told you these things
thats right
and he told you to wear the mask
thats funny
very funny
tontos a comanche
hes one of you
no more
what do you mean
his mind is broken
he is a band apart
many moons ago
a boy found two white men
in the desert
he brought them to
his village to be healed
when they found silver in the river
they asked the boy where it came from
in exchange for a cheap pocket watch
from sears roebuck
the boy showed them
where the river begins
where they found more silver
than any white man had ever seen
they took what they could carry
but they wanted to
keep the place a secret
so they could one day return
the boy could not live
with what he had done
so he decided the men were possessed
by evil spirits in the silver
he called it windigo
like the ghost stories
we tell our children
and he made a vow
when he found these two men
he would drain their blood
into the soil of his ancestors
so he could return to the tribe
but he is too late
there is no more tribe to return to
our time has passed
they call it progress
youre john reid brother of dan
yes
by this totem your brother swore
if we kept the peace
he would protect our land
now the cavalry cut down our children
like all white men your brother lied
no no dan was murdered
and if you let me go
ill keep his promise
so we have a deal
not so much
my name come up
please this is a mistake
there doesnt need to be a war
it makes no difference
we are already ghosts
shh shh
cavalry
let us bring the pure sceptre
of almighty god
to the heathens
oh thank god civilisation

and well get this whole
misunderstanding cleared up

so perhaps when you fell
and hit your head
captain
if there is a ranger still alive
we will scour the countryside
until we find him
i promise you that
heavenly father
we call upon you in this
our hour of need
for you are the shepherd
that shall guide the wanderer
through the desert
you are the light
that shall be his beacon
in the darkness
and yours is the mighty sword
that shall strike down his enemies
for he is on the path of righteousness
amen
latham cole
sir
someones coming in
sentries
at your posts
daddy
dan
we dont know whos out there
i intend to find out
latham cole
wendell take mrs reid
and her son to the supply car
for their own safety
what is it friend
this is the man youve been looking for
butch cavendish
just like one of those great lizards
buried in the desert
the last of a dying breed
thats enough
i brought this man in for justice
of course
soldier
im just doing my job mrs reid
you wanna keep me in this room
youre gonna have to shoot me
is that part of your job
whoa
danny
and dont let him leave
but hes just a boy
thats right
oh
and hes got a twitchy finger too
stupid white man
there were rumours
that sustained us
a lone ranger
a masked man
a ghost some people said
and now here you are
flesh and blood
civilised society
has no place for a masked man
of course not
how can i thank you
for what youve done
you can stop this war before its too late
comanche didnt attack
those settlements
it was butch cavendish and his gang
all for this
butch cavendish
in one man
everything i hate about this country
no sense of the common good
no vision
come to think of it
not unlike your brother dan
men like that cant accept
what we know to be true
a man cant stay the same
with the world evolving around him
remember me
but a man cant choose
his brother can he
its almost as if his brother chooses him
you see thats what we are
me and butch
brothers
born in the desert
all those years ago
and now youve come back
train tracks
thats what dan found
in indian territory isnt it
he knew there was gonna be a war
and he wouldnt go along with it
so you had him killed
like i said
no vision
stop this train
oh theres no stopping this train john
i think you know that
danny
youre not my daddy
no put the gun down son
wheres my daddy
hes dead danny
he killed him
shut up
listen to me danny
you remember me its your uncle john
you trust me dont you danny
look danny
im gonna put my gun away okay
nice and slow
theres nothing to be afraid of
shoot him son
danny
is my daddy dead
is he
is he
just put the gun down
please
now just put the gun down
captain arrest these men
this man is a common criminal
trespassing on railway property
comanche never
raided any settlements
they staged the attacks
so they could violate the treaty
weve heard enough captain
you represent
the united states government
you do not work for this man
captain
they started this war
well if what you say is true
that would mean
i attacked the comanche for no reason
thats right captain
slaughter of the innocents
their blood on your hands
tenfold
are you capable of that
well the way i see it
these men are with the rail road
so the question is
who the hell are you
clear the track men
outta the way
going to pit
my god
out here its just rock
put it on a train its priceless
what could you buy with all of that
a country captain
a great country
for which our children will thank us

mister tonto
mister tonto
you mean they killed all of them
the indians the settlers
dan

you were right
there is no justice
cole controls everything
the rail road the cavalry
everything
if men like him represent the law
id rather be an outlaw
that is why
you wear the mask
something very wrong with that horse
ladies and gentlemen
we are here today to celebrate a dream
and now id like to introduce the man
who made that dream a reality
chairman of the transcontinental
railroad corporation
mr lewis habberman the third
thank you
but i cannot take credit alone
no sir
the working men before you
deserve your applause
yes
as does one man in particular
and a more dedicated loyal employee
the rail road could not ask for
mr latham cole
come on
good man
bravo sir
mr cole
a testament of our thanks
cheers
you missed something
where did you get the explosives
i told you
no you didnt
but you had a plan i mean

this is a damn bank robbery
oh mr habberman

would like to follow me
i have a little surprise for you

what was that
tunnelling for supply routes
nothing to be concerned about
this way gentlemen

hes coming for you
just like frank said
what you got makes them reid boys
so hot under the collar anyway
maybe ill have a taste and find out
the men around this table represent
the finest families in our country
as well as controlling interest
in the transcontinental
railway corporation
hear hear
what you cannot know
is that over the past six months
i have leveraged a position
which will make me
the majority shareholder
when this company is
listed monday morning
on the new york city stock exchange
in essence gentlemen you work for me
have you lost your mind
do you have any idea the cost
each one of those freight cars contains
45 tons of purest raw silver
when it reaches the bank
in san francisco
thats 65 million dollars
its what you might call
a hostile takeover
you can keep the watch
have you checked the undercarriage

assistance to you madam
