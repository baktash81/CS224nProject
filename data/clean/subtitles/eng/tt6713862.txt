samadhi
ancient sanskrit word modern equivalent
fundamental challenge making film samadhi
samadhi points something cant conveyed level mind
film simply outer manifestation inner journey
intention teach samadhi provide information mind
inspire directly discover true nature
samadhi relevant ever
time history forgotten samadhi forgotten
forgot
forgetting maya illusion self
humans us live immersed daily lives little thought
going
us never realized true self soul buddha called annata
beyond name form beyond thinking
result believe limited bodies
live fear either conscious unconscious limited self structure
identified die
todays world vast majority people engaged religious spiritual
practices yoga prayer meditation chanting kind ritual practicing
techniques conditioned
means part ego construct
seeking activity isnt problem thinking found answer
external form problem
spirituality common form different pathological thinking
going everywhere
agitation mind
human opposed human
ego construct wants money power love everything
socalled spiritual path desire spiritual awake equanimous
peaceful enlightened
danger watching film mind want acquire samadhi even
dangerous mind might think acquired samadhi
whenever desire attain something sure ego construct
work
samadhi attaining adding anything
realize samadhi learn die die
life death like yin yang inseparable continuum
endlessly unfolding beginning end
push away death also push away life
experience truth directly longer fear life
death
told society culture time
slaves deeper unconscious biological craving aversion governs choices
ego construct nothing impulse repeat
simply path energy took tendency energy take
path whether positive negative organism
endless levels memory mind spirals within spirals
consciousness identifies mind ego construct ties social
conditioning could call matrix
aspects ego conscious unconscious
archaic wiring primal existential fears actually driving whole machine
endless patterns grasping towards pleasure avoidance pain sublimated
pathological behaviours work relationships beliefs
thoughts whole way living
like cattle humans live die passive subjugation feeding lives matrix
live lives locked narrow patterns
lives often filled great suffering never occurs us actually
become free
possible let go life inherited past live
one waiting come forth inner world
born world biological conditioned structures without self awareness
often look young childs eyes trace self luminous emptiness
person one grows mask worn consciousness
shakespeare said worlds stage men women merely players
awakened individual consciousness shines personality mask
awake dont become identified character
dont believe masks wearing
give playing role
twentyfour hundred years plato wrote republic humanity still making
way platos cave
fact may transfixed illusions ever
plato socrates describe group people lived chained cave lives
facing blank wall
could see shadows projected wall things passing front
fire behind
puppet show becomes world
according socrates shadows close prisoners would ever get seeing
reality
even told outside world continued believe shadows

even suspected something unwilling leave
familiar
humanity today like people seen shadows cave wall
shadows analogous thoughts
world thinking world know
another world beyond thinking
beyond dualistic mind
willing leave cave leave known find truth

order experience samadhi necessary turn attention away shadows away
thoughts towards light
person used darkness must gradually become accustomed
light
like acclimatizing new paradigm takes time effort willingness
explore new well shed old
mind likened trap consciousness labyrinth prison
prison prison
prison illusion
identified illusory self asleep
aware prison fight get illusion treating
illusion real still remain asleep except dream becomes
nightmare
chasing running shadows forever
samadhi awakening dream separate self egoic construct
samadhi awakening identification prison call
never actually free wherever go prison
awakening get rid mind matrix contrary
identified experience play life fully enjoying
show without craving fear
ancient teachings called divine game leila game playing
duality
human consciousness continuum
one extreme humans identified material self
extreme samadhi cessation self
every step take continuum towards samadhi brings less suffering
less suffering mean life free pain
samadhi beyond duality pain pleasure
means less mind less self creating resistance whatever
unfolds resistance creates suffering
realizing samadhi even allows see end continuum
see something material world self interest
actual cessation self structure samadhi egoic thought
self duality yet still annata self
emptiness dawn prajna wisdom understanding immanent
self far beyond play duality beyond entire continuum
immanent self timeless unchanging always
enlightenment merging primordial spiral everchanging manifested world
lotus time unfolds timeless
inner wiring grows like everunfolding flower disidentify self becoming
living bridge world time timeless
merely realizing immanent self beginning ones path
people experience lose samadhi countless times meditation
able integrate facets life
unusual profound insights nature meditation
self inquiry find falling back old patterns forgetting
truth
realize stillness emptiness every facet life every facet ones
self become emptiness dancing things
stillness something separate movement
opposite movement
samadhi stillness recognized identical movement form identical emptiness
nonsensical mind mind coming duality
rene descartes father western philosophy famous saying think therefore

phrase clearly encapsulates fall civilisation full scale
identification shadows cave wall
descartes error like error almost humans equating fundamental
thinking
beginning famous treatise descartes wrote almost everything
called doubt doubt senses even thoughts
likewise kalama sutra buddha said order ascertain truth one
must doubt traditions scriptures teachings content ones mind
senses
men started great scepticism difference descartes stopped
inquiring level thinking buddha went deeper penetrated beyond
deepest levels mind
maybe descartes gone beyond thinking mind would realized true nature
western consciousness would different today
instead descartes described possibility evil demon could keeping us
veil illusion
descartes recognize evil demon
movie matrix could hooked elaborate program feeding
us illusory dream world
movie humans lived lives matrix another level
merely batteries feeding life force machines used energy
agenda
people always want blame something outside state world
unhappiness
whether person particular group country religion kind controlling
illuminati like descartes evil demon sentient machines matrix
ironically demon descartes envisioned thing defined

realize samadhi becomes clear controller machine
evil demon leaching life day day
machine
self structure made many little conditioned subprograms little bosses
one little boss craves food another craves money another status position power
sex intimacy
another wants consciousness attention others
desires literally endless never satisfied
spend lot time energy decorating prisons succumbing pressures improve
masks feeding little bosses making powerful
like drug addicts try satisfy little bosses end craving
path freedom self improvement somehow satisfying selfs agenda
dropping selfs agenda altogether
people fear awakening true nature mean lose individuality
enjoyment life
actually opposite true unique individuation soul expressed
conditioned self overcome
remain asleep matrix us never find soul actually
wants express
path samadhi involves meditation observing conditioned self
changes realizing true nature change
come still point source await instructions
without insistence outer world change
higher done
mind tries change outer world conform idea
think path like trying change image mirror manipulating
reflection
make image mirror smile obviously cant manipulate reflection
realize authentic source reflection
realize authentic self doesnt mean anything outside necessarily
needs change
changes conscious intelligent inner energy prana freed
conditioned patterns becomes available directed soul
become aware souls purpose able watch conditioned
self endless pursuits let go
greek mythology said gods condemned sisyphus repeat meaningless
task eternity
task endlessly push boulder mountain roll

french existentialist nobel prize winning author albert camus saw situation
sisyphus metaphor humanity
asked question find meaning absurd existence
humans toiling endlessly building tomorrow never arrives
die
truly realize truth either go mad identified
egoic personas awaken become free
never succeed outer struggle reflection inner
world
cosmic joke absurdity situation becomes clear complete
utter failure egoic self awaken futile pursuits
zen saying enlightenment chop wood carry water
enlightenment chop wood carry water
enlightenment one must roll ball hill enlightenment one must
also roll ball hill
changed
inner resistance
struggle dropped rather one struggles realized
illusory
individual individual mind divine higher mind aligned
samadhi ultimately dropping inner resistance changing phenomena without
exception
one able realize inner peace irrespective circumstance attained
true samadhi
drop resistance condone one thing another inner
freedom contingent outer
important note accept reality doesnt necessarily
mean stop taking action world become meditating pacifists
actually opposite true free act without driven unconscious
motives possible act alignment tao full force inner
energy behind us
many argue order change world bring peace need fight
harder perceived enemies
fighting peace like shouting silence creates dont want
days war everything war terror war disease
war hunger
every war actually war
fight part collective delusion
say want peace continue elect leaders engage war
lie saying human rights continue buy products
made sweatshops
say want clean air continue pollute
want science cure us cancer wont change selfdestructive habitual behaviours
make us likely sick
delude promoting better life
dont want see hidden parts condoning suffering death
belief win war cancer hunger terror enemy created
thinking behaviour actually lets us continue delude
dont change way operate planet
inner world revolution must first take place
directly feel spiral life within outer world come
alignment tao
anything add chaos already created mind
war peace arise together endless dance one continuum
one half exist without
light exist without dark exist without
world seems want light without darkness fullness without emptiness happiness without
sadness
mind gets involved fragmented world becomes
every solution comes egoic mind driven idea problem
solution becomes even greater problem trying solve
resist persists
human ingenuity creates new antibiotics find nature getting cunning bacteria
gets stronger
despite best efforts ongoing fight prevalence cancer actually increasing
number hungry people world steadily grows number terrorist attacks worldwide
continues rise
whats wrong approach
like sorcerers apprentice goethes poem taken hold great power
wisdom wield
problem understand tool using
understand human mind proper role purpose
crisis born limited conditioned way think way feel
experience life
rationalism robbed us ability recognize experience wisdom
many ancient cultures
egoic thinking robbed us ability feel depth profound sacredness
life numinosity life realize entirely different levels consciousness
almost lost humanity
ancient egyptian tradition neters archetypal forms whose characteristics
could embodied purified physical spiritual bodies way
fit house higher consciousnesses
original neter divine principle wisdom known thoth tehuti
often depicted scribe head bird ibis represented origin
knowledge wisdom
thoth could described cosmic principle thinking thought
thoth gave us language concepts writing mathematics arts manifestations
mind
gone special training allowed access thoths sacred knowledge
book thoth physical book wisdom akashic etheric
realm
legend tells thoths knowledge deeply hidden secret place within every
human protected golden serpent
archetypal perennial myth serpent dragon guarding treasure one
permeates many cultures called names kundalini shakti chi holy
spirit inner energy
golden serpent egoic construct bound inner energies
mastered overcome soul never able attain true wisdom
said book thoth brought nothing suffering individual
read even though would find secrets gods hidden
within stars
must understood book brought suffering individual read
ego tried control
egyptian tradition awakened consciousness represented osiris
without awakened consciousness knowledge understanding obtained limited self
would dangerous disconnected higher wisdom
eye horus open
esoteric meaning find similar familiar story
fall garden eden
book thoth parallels book knowledge good evil whose fruit adam eve
tempted eat
humanity course already eaten forbidden fruit already opened book thoth
cast garden
serpent metaphor primordial spiral extends microcosm
macrocosm
today serpent living
egoic mind expressed manifested world
never access much knowledge
gone deep material world even finding socalled god particle
never limited ignorant live
understand mechanism create suffering
thinking created world
whenever label something good bad create preference mind due
coming egoic structures self interests
solution fight peace conquer nature simply recognize
truth existence ego structure creates duality split
self mine man nature inner outer
ego violence requires barrier boundary order
without ego war anything
hubris overreaching nature create profit
external crises world reflect serious inner crises dont know

completely identified egoic identities consumed fears cut
true nature
races religions countries political affiliations group belong reinforce
egoic identities
almost every group exists planet today wants claim perspective true
correct individual level
claiming truth group perpetuates existence
way ego self structure defines
ever different realities polarized belief systems coexisting
earth
possible different people experience completely different thoughts emotional
reactions external phenomena
way samsara nirvana heaven hell two different dimensions occupying
world
event may appear apocalyptic one person could seen blessing another
becoming obvious external circumstances dont affect
inner world particular way
realize samadhi become selfpropelled wheel become autonomous universe unto
oneself
experience life contingent changing phenomena
analogy made metatrons cube
metatron mentioned various ancient christian islamic jewish texts archetypally
related egyptian neter thoth well hermes trismegistus greece
metatron intimately connected tetragrammaton
tetragrammaton fundamental geometric pattern template primordial emanation
physical reality called word god logos
see two dimensional representation figure look certain way
see three cube
see cube nothing changed figure mind added new
dimension seeing
dimensionality ones perspective simply matter becoming habituated new way
perceiving world
upon realizing samadhi become free perspective free create new perspectives
self invested attached particular viewpoint
greatest minds human history often pointed levels thought beyond limited
self structure
einstein said true measure human determined primarily measure
sense attained liberation self
thinking existence self bad thinking wonderful
tool mind service heart
vedanta said mind makes good servant poor master
ego perpetually filters reality language labels constantly judging
preferring one thing another
mind senses master create endless suffering endless
craving aversion locking us matrix thinking
want realize samadhi judge thoughts good bad find
prior thought prior senses
labels dropped possible see things
moment child told bird believe theyre told
never see bird
see thoughts
people think free conscious awake
believe already awake would difficult work attain
believe already
becomes possible awaken necessary accept asleep living
matrix
examine life honestly without lying
able stop robotic repetitive life patterns want
stop seeking pleasure avoiding pain addicted certain foods activities
pastimes
constantly judging blaming criticizing others
mind incessantly seek stimulus completely fulfilled
silence
react people think
seeking approval positive reinforcement
somehow sabotage situations life
people experience lives way today tomorrow
year ten years
begin observe robotlike nature become awake
begin recognize depth problem
completely utterly asleep lost dream
like inhabitants platos cave hear truth willing
capable changing lives attached familiar patterns
go great lengths justifying patterns burying heads sand rather
facing truth
want saviours willing get cross
willing pay free
realize change inner world must prepared change outer life
old structure old identity must become dead soil new growth
comes
first step awakening realize identified matrix
human mind mask
something within us must hear truth roused slumber
part something timeless always known truth
matrix mind distracts us entertains us keeps us endlessly consuming grasping
cycle craving aversion constantly changing forms keeping us flowering
consciousness evolutionary birthright samadhi
pathological thinking passes normal life
divine essence become enslaved identified limited self structure
great wisdom truth buried deep within
j krishnamurti said measure ones health well adjusted
profoundly sick society
identification egoic mind sickness samadhi cure
saints sages awakened beings throughout history learned wisdom selfsurrender
possible realize true self
peer veil maya let go illusory self left
