dad 
 debris clattering 
kitai  i ve heard stories of earth 
a paradise 
until we destroyed it 
the founding of the united
ranger corps 1000 years ago
was a global military effort 
an evacuation of earth 
the rangers would lead the settlement
of mankind s new home 
nova prime 
but we were not alone 
the aliens released the ursa 
 screeching 
monsters bred to kill humans 
technically blind 
the ursa sees humans
based on pheromones
we secrete when frightened 
they literally smell our fear 
humankind was again
in danger of extinction
and again turned to the rangers
for the answer 
that answer came in the form of
the prime commander  cypher raige 
the original ghost 
he is believed to be
so completely free of fear
that to an ursa  he is invisible 
this phenomena is known
as  ghosting  
this isn t a race  cadet 
man  raige 
your test scores are very impressive 
in the classroom 
you are an outstanding ranger 
but in the field  you collapse 
i m not advancing you 
you may try again next year 
sir  i am dedicated  have studied
and display conduct
becoming of a ranger  sir 
i request that the commander
reconsider his assessment  sir 
cadet 
sir  my father s returning home tonight 
i haven t seen him in   
it s a very special day for our family 
and i have got to be able to tell him
that i am a ranger  sir 
you tell your father
that i said   welcome home  
dismissed 
faia 
hi 
how were finals 
how were finals 
i wasn t advanced to ranger 
where do we look when we speak 
i was not advanced to ranger 
you were not advanced to ranger   
i was not
advanced to ranger  sir 
that s all right  you re young 
i ran the canyons 11 seconds
faster than you did 
you weren t ready  velan s a good man 
he knows his stuff 
if you were  he would have promoted you 
you weren t ready 
i m not hungry 
i m going to my room 
are you asking me or telling me 
may i go to my room 
denied  sit down 
i have a last visit to iphitos 
i m flying tomorrow 
supervising training 
and after it s completed 
i m announcing my retirement 
retirement 
maybe i ll work with you
in turbine division 
together 
please  no 
 both chuckling 
i want my family back 
i want you back 
that boy in there
is trying to find you 
he s a feeling boy 
he s an intuitive boy 
he watched you read that book
with senshi his entire life 
he s reading that book now 
he s reaching for you 
don t get me wrong  i respect
everything you ve done 
but you have a son in the other
room that you do not know 
he blames himself
for what happened to senshi 
he thinks it s his fault 
he s drowning 
and he does not need
a commanding officer 
he needs a father 
pack your bags  you re
coming with me to iphitos 
faia  this was a really good decision 
now go make some good
memories together 
you take it easy on your father 
he s a little rusty 
okay 
general raige 
i was on the plateau 
you saved me and four others 
i just came from seeing
my baby girl s face for the first time 
stand me up 
that won t be necessary  ranger 
stand me up 
man  watch the left side 
pull 
perimeter s good 
i m reading moby dick 
your mother told me 
that s great 
man   over speakers  our military transport
will arrive at training base on iphitos
in seven hours 
i m going to grab some rack time 
i recommend you do the same 
hey  can you read 
 sniffs 
i said  can you read 
yes  sir 
well  there s a sign back there 
 authorized personnel only  
why didn t you read that 
what s in the cage 
might wanna go easy on him  sarge 
that s the prime commander s son
right there 
you re raige s kid 
what s in there 
you wanna see 
senshi  kit  we have to go right now 
is that    
they surprised us 
sent ships  dropped those things 
an ursa 
man  we re taking it to
iphitos for ghost training 
you want to see if you can ghost 
man  ghosting is when you don t
have a trace of fear in you 
most guys freeze 
that s your cerebral cortex
looking for an answer it doesn t have 
see  even your brain knows
you re screwed 
your blood is filling
with adrenaline now 
whether you know it or not 
your heart s beating faster 
it s getting a little
harder to breathe 
your neurobiological system
is telling you to run
but your knees
are too weak to move 
and it s too late anyway 
the pores on your skin
have already opened up 
secreting an imperceptible amount
of pheromones into the air 
and all you can think about
is when it s going to kill you 
 chuckles 
senshi 
 roars 
she sees you  kid  heh  heh 
attention on deck 
kitai  back to

behind your seat  there s a life suit 
put it on  strap in  full harness 
yes  sir 
good evening  general 
captain 
what s the last known position
of the closest asteroid storm 
category four
asteroid formation 
two thousand kilometers to starboard
at plus four five declination 
i detected graviton vibrations
in the hull 
but you detected how 
graviton buildup could be a precursor
to mass expansion 
that storm could be on us in minutes 
but  sir  mass expansion
is one in a million 
if we try to navigate out 
the pull of our own graviton weight
could set the thing off 
let s just hold course
and hope i m wrong 
just out of interest  sir 
how often are you wrong 
my wife would give a very interesting
answer to that question 
 rapid beeping 
graviton count s decreasing 
eight hundred parts per million 
six hundred and fifty 
well  sir  there s a first time
for everything 
 rumbling 
 people clamoring 
 klaxon blaring 
cypher  turn into it  match bearing 
dad 
she s a dead stick  engines off line 
we re losing her 
can you travel us out of here 
where 
the anchorage  lycia  it s closest 
negative  sir  we cannot
wormhole travel in the middle of this 
do it 
coordinates for anchorage at lycia
locked in  no confirmation signal 
travel us now 
without confirmation   
that s an order 
go  go 
 machine beeping 
cabin pressure dropping 
heavy damage to outer hull

computer  warning  this planet has been
declared unfit for human habitation 
placed under class one quarantine
by the interplanetary authority

do not attempt to land 
repeat  do not attempt to land 
it s not possible 
the computer might have defaulted
back to a known demarcation point 
no  not here 
travel us again 
negative  sir  this ship
is going to tear apart at any moment 
set her down 
mayday  mayday  this is
hesper two niner niner in distress

you all right 
you stay there

general cypher raige 
we crash landed 
two confirmed survivors 
kitai 
the emergency beacon you brought me will
fire a distress signal deep into space 
but it is damaged 
there is another one
in the tail section of our ship 
this is us here 
that is the tail 
somewhere in this area 
it s approximately 100 kilometers
from here 
we need that beacon 
do you understand 
both my legs are broken 
one very badly 
you are going to retrieve that beacon
or we are going to die 
do you understand 
repeat what i just said to you 
i have to go retrieve the beacon
or we re going to die 
you have air filtration inhalers 
you need to take one now 
the fluid will coat your lungs 
increasing oxygen extraction
allowing you to breathe comfortably
in the environment 
you have six vials 
at your weight  that should be 20 to 24 hours each 
that s more than enough 
your life suit and backpack
are equipped
with digital and virtual imaging
so i will be able to see
everything that you see
and what you do not see 
i will guide you 
it will be like i m right there with you 
take my cutlass 
it s the c 40 
the full 22 configurations 
kitai 
every single decision you make
will be life or death 
this is a class one quarantined planet 
everything on this planet
has evolved to kill humans 
do you know where we are 
no  sir 
this is earth 
the ursa 
three possibilities  the first and most
likely is that it died in the crash 
the second and less likely is that it is
injured very badly and still contained 
the third and least likely is
that it is out 
we will proceed  however  in
anticipation of the worst case scenario 
every movement will be
under protocol escape and evade 
if he s out there
i will see him long before
he gets anywhere near you 
do you understand 
yes  sir 
do exactly as i tell you
and we will survive 
cypher  kitai  calm down 
take a knee 
root yourself
in this present moment now 
sight  sound  smell 
what do you feel 
my body feels heavier 
very good  earth s gravitational pull
is different than at home 
very good

great work  cadet 
but you are going to have to lie there

the parasite that stung you

cypher  it s time to wake up

how did you do it 
how did you first ghost 
out for a run 
alone 
something we re never
supposed to do 
ursa de camos right in front of me 
i go for my cutlass 
it shoots its pincer
right through my shoulder 
next thing i know 
we re over the cliff  falling 
30 meters straight down
into the river 
we settle onto the bottom 
it s on top of me 
but it s not moving 
and i realize
he s trying to drown me 
i m thinking   i m gonna die  
 thunder rumbling 
 i m gonna die  
 i cannot believe
this is how i m going to die  
i can see my blood bubbling up 
mixing with the sunlight
shining through the water 
and i think   wow   
that s really pretty  
and everything slows down 
and i see its pincer
through my shoulder 
and i decide
i don t want that in there anymore 
so i pull it out 
and he lets me go 
and more than that  i can tell   
it can t find me 
it doesn t even know where to look 
and it dawned on me   
fear is not real 
the only place that fear can exist
is in our thoughts of the future 
it is a product of our imagination 
causing us to fear things
that do not at present
and may not ever exist 
that is near insanity  kitai 
now  do not misunderstand me 
danger is very real 
but fear is a choice 
we are all telling ourselves a story

you did your best 
you have nothing more to prove

what was your mistake 
trusting me 
depending on me 
thinking that i could do this 
i am giving you an order   
to turn around

you wouldn t give any other ranger
that order 
you are not a ranger

what was i supposed to do 
what did you want me to do 
she gave me an order 
she said no matter what

was i supposed to just come out

what do you think  cadet 
what do you think
you should have done 
because that is all that matters 
what do you think
you should have done 
and where were you  
she called out for you 
she called your name
