kitai ive heard stories of earth
a paradise
until we destroyed it
the founding of the united
ranger corps 1000 years ago
was a global military effort
an evacuation of earth
the rangers would lead the settlement
of mankinds new home
nova prime
but we were not alone
the aliens released the ursa
screeching
monsters bred to kill humans
technically blind
the ursa sees humans
based on pheromones
we secrete when frightened
they literally smell our fear
humankind was again
in danger of extinction
and again turned to the rangers
for the answer
that answer came in the form of
the prime commander cypher raige
the original ghost
he is believed to be
so completely free of fear
that to an ursa he is invisible
this phenomena is known
as ghosting
this isnt a race cadet
man raige
your test scores are very impressive
in the classroom
you are an outstanding ranger
but in the field you collapse
im not advancing you
you may try again next year
sir i am dedicated have studied
and display conduct
becoming of a ranger sir
i request that the commander
reconsider his assessment sir
cadet

he watched you read that book
with senshi his entire life
hes reading that book now
hes reaching for you
dont get me wrong i respect
everything youve done
but you have a son in the other
room that you do not know
he blames himself
for what happened to senshi
he thinks its his fault
hes drowning
and he does not need
a commanding officer
he needs a father
pack your bags youre
coming with me to iphitos
faia this was a really good decision
now go make some good
memories together
you take it easy on your father

they surprised us
sent ships dropped those things
an ursa
man were taking it to
iphitos for ghost training
you want to see if you can ghost
man ghosting is when you dont
have a trace of fear in you
most guys freeze
thats your cerebral cortex
looking for an answer it doesnt have
see even your brain knows
youre screwed
your blood is filling
with adrenaline now
whether you know it or not
your hearts beating faster
its getting a little
harder to breathe
your neurobiological system
is telling you to run
but your knees
are too weak to move
and its too late anyway
the pores on your skin
have already opened up
secreting an imperceptible amount
of pheromones into the air
and all you can think about
is when its going to kill you
chuckles
senshi
roars
she sees you kid heh heh
attention on deck
kitai back to
your seat now
rangers go redcon1
secure all cargo
chattering
behind your seat theres a life suit
put it on strap in full harness
yes sir
good evening general
captain
whats the last known position
of the closest asteroid storm
categoryfour
asteroid formation
two thousand kilometers to starboard
at plusfourfive declination
i detected graviton vibrations
in the hull
but you detected how
graviton buildup could be a precursor
to mass expansion
that storm could be on us in minutes
but sir mass expansion
is one in a million
if we try to navigate out
the pull of our own graviton weight
could set the thing off
lets just hold course
and hope im wrong
just out of interest sir
how often are you wrong
my wife would give a very interesting
answer to that question
rapid beeping
graviton counts decreasing
eight hundred parts per million
six hundred and fifty
well sir theres a first time
for everything
rumbling
people clamoring
klaxon blaring
cypher turn into it match bearing
dad
shes a dead stick engines offline
were losing her
can you travel us out of here
where
the anchorage lycia its closest
negative sir we cannot
wormhole travel in the middle of this
do it

its not possible
the computer might have defaulted
back to a known demarcation point
no not here
travel us again

inside
theres an emergency beacon
silver
like a saucer bring it to me
groans
cypher consolidate inventory up
grunts
general cypher raige
we crashlanded
two confirmed survivors
kitai
the emergency beacon you brought me will
fire a distress signal deep into space
but it is damaged
there is another one
in the tail section of our ship
this is us here
that is the tail
somewhere in this area
its approximately 100 kilometers
from here
we need that beacon
do you understand
both my legs are broken
one very badly
you are going to retrieve that beacon
or we are going to die
do you understand
repeat what i just said to you
i have to go retrieve the beacon
or were going to die
you have air filtration inhalers
you need to take one now
the fluid will coat your lungs
increasing oxygen extraction
allowing you to breathe comfortably
in the environment
you have six vials
at your weight that should be 20 to 24 hours each
thats more than enough
your life suit and backpack
are equipped
with digital and virtual imaging
so i will be able to see
everything that you see
and what you do not see
i will guide you
it will be like im right there with you
take my cutlass
its the c40
the full 22 configurations
kitai
every single decision you make
will be life or death
this is a classone quarantined planet
everything on this planet
has evolved to kill humans
do you know where we are
no sir
this is earth
the ursa
three possibilities the first and most
likely is that it died in the crash
the second and less likely is that it is
injured very badly and still contained
the third and least likely is
that it is out
we will proceed however in
anticipation of the worstcase scenario
every movement will be
under protocol escape and evade
if hes out there
i will see him long before
he gets anywhere near you
do you understand
yes sir
do exactly as i tell you
and we will survive
cypher kitai calm down
take a knee
root yourself

dad
dad
im here
how did you do it
how did you first ghost
out for a run
alone
something were never
supposed to do
ursa decamos right in front of me
i go for my cutlass
it shoots its pincer
right through my shoulder
next thing i know
were over the cliff falling
30 meters straight down
into the river
we settle onto the bottom
its on top of me
but its not moving
and i realize
hes trying to drown me
im thinking im gonna die
thunder rumbling
im gonna die
i cannot believe
this is how im going to die
i can see my blood bubbling up
mixing with the sunlight
shining through the water
and i think wow
thats really pretty
and everything slows down
and i see its pincer
through my shoulder
and i decide
i dont want that in there anymore
so i pull it out
and he lets me go
and more than that i can tell
it cant find me
it doesnt even know where to look
and it dawned on me
fear is not real
the only place that fear can exist
is in our thoughts of the future
it is a product of our imagination
causing us to fear things
that do not at present
and may not ever exist
that is near insanity kitai
now do not misunderstand me
danger is very real
but fear is a choice
we are all telling ourselves a story
and that day mine changed
cypher fourteen kilometers to the falls
thats our midway checkpoint
kitai im reading you
