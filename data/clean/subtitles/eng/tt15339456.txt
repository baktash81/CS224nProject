whats that
i want to start
with some questions
oh got it
is it hard for you
has it been hard
for you since
mmm
not in the way that i think you
would think it would be but
uh its pretty much
common knowledge
that it takes at least 20 shells
to have a community
that thats about the minimum
that you need to survive so
yeah
i think at first
i was thinking
were not gonna make it
but sometimes you just have
to disregard those rules
and think well actually
the rule is
that i want to be
having a good life
and stay alive and
and not just survive
but have a good life
tell me about
whats life like now
it me uh
i appreciate
its different beauties
but it its not the way
i wouldve done things
if i was still in the group
but theyre not here
so thats why i have
the electric mixer
ready
mmmhmm
tada
i mean
i dont want my voice in it
well thats up to you
so stop asking me
questions is what im saying
oh oh okay
do your parents work
have you ever met a chef
what happens if you break this
have you ever eaten a raspberry
um and what was that like
are you gonna ask me questions
hello
oh man this is weird
i dont want my voice in it
how am i supposed
to ask you questions
there are actually
only two of us now
myself
and my grandmother
nana connie
back when the man
and the woman lived here
there were a lot of us
more sounds and smells
and uh things to say
cause there were
more people to talk to
there a stage
all right
ah up
these days its quieter
rolling
give me some levels
give give you some levels
like
just like talk
a little bit like oh uh
hello my name is
darn it

ive done that
my name is marcel
and im partially a shell
as you can see on my body
but i also have shoes
and um a face
so i like that about myself
and i like myself
and i have a lot of
other great qualities as well
that was perfect
okay

classical music played for them

this is my bread room
uh its a bedroom
but i sleep on a piece of bread

like the concept of having a dog
oh god i can smell his face
but i just tie a hair
to a piece of lint
and i drag it around
i love you
come on come on
thats it
sometimes people say
that my head is too big
for my body
and then i say
compared to what
sometimes if i dont have
a way to itch my itch

i just stand there
i just let it get me

while theyre making it
mmm
no
thats sort of a way
to put it yeah
no i just am making
a little video portrait
about marcel
yeah
a a film
uh yeah
its like the truth kind of
its a
and its the truth about marcel
i mean i hope so
i guess he could really spin it
and make me look like a total
so this is your garden
out here huh
yes
beautiful
thank you
thank you for the aromas
my house was very popular
i had lots of friends
and if you told me then
many years ago
that i wouldve spent
so much time in a garden
i wouldve said
are you kidding
okay you see these ones
you can feel them
theyre not quite ripe
but in a few days
they would be
it wasnt easy
i didnt know anything
about farming
because when the couple
still lived here
there was always food
in the pantry in the kitchen
there were stacks
here and there
but when they went away
the food disappeared
so i had to taught myself
how to farm
planting harvesting
shes always been
a pretty tough cookie
everything has a function
with her
theres no one button
thats there for decoration
you know what i mean
mmmhmm
shes just like a backhoe
but i will say you can
really see her tender side
when shes working
with the bugs
is she okay
yeah shes okay
shes a little loopy
she had a little bit too much
uh nectar
vino fiore right franny
my community found the bugs
to be deeply unlikeable
okay well put her
here in the sun
and in a few seconds
shell be dry
but connies
made friends with many of them
and in return they actually
help her with the gardening
at first
found them a little yucky
but now i see their beauty
i cannot stand this thing
because they turn the soil
they break it
its wonderful to have them
his whole body looks
like his pants are off
it reminds me
of whoopi goldberg
in sister act
how she helps them
to do graffiti
in a meaningful way
or something and
oh there she goes
oops
ow ow ow
shes gone
uh sort of
oh wow
what is uh
what is this
hmm
whats that
what are you doing now
with marcel
oh im making a movie
uh
a documentary
about marcel
yeah
a documentary uh a film
yeah
ah marcel
you remember nan
we were just talking about it
its a movie
and were doing it
together but
what i just said before
thats what you
and we just joked about it
yes
its the truth
but its the truth about me
she has lost a small piece
of a very large puzzle
nan
nana
once or twice a week
ill find her in here
snoozing in
the laundry basket and
is it bad for her to be in here
yeah its not
the safest place to be
you know my cousin
fell asleep in a pocket
and thats why
i dont like the saying
everything comes out
in the wash
because sometimes it doesnt
or sometimes it does
and theyre just like
a completely different person
cause after that
my cousin would
just sit by the window
and wait for fire trucks
to go by
guess what i use
to tie my skis to my car
what
a hair
guess what my
marcel the shell with shoes on
guess
guess what my skis are
what
toe nails from a man
wait hold on
so youre telling me that
84 different people have
just watched
yeah isnt that cool
yeah
i mean geez
what
just wow
what do you
do when you get bored
uh i move around
i could tell hes
performing a little bit for you
you know
mmmhmm
da da da da
youre giving him a stage
its good for him
one two
the stage makes him feel good
playful he needs that
he hasnt been able to get that
since the others
were taken from us
okay so do you just want me
to start at the beginning
i dont actually know
how it started
but the man and the woman
started to yell at each other
more often than they would
talk to each other
youd just hear
these big noises from the sky
and my cousins house
fell down this one time
when the office door
got slammed
we started
to have a shelter plan
we all go to the sock drawer
and so everyone
will be safe there
this was a sunday
and everybody gets together
and we all watch 60 minutes
as a community
60 minutes the
yeah so this is
where we were
and
every week all of you
yeah we love it
we just call it the show
thats how much we love it
lesley
whos lesley
lesley show
she likes lesley stahl
im lesley stahl
she blows cases wide open
and shes got class
tonight on 60 minutes
but
we could tell
that something was the matter
because the clock
started ticking
and it was just
the two of us there
it was a big one
and we had
we had no warning
what we think is that
everybody scooted
into the sock drawer and uh
and the man just
dumped all the drawers
into a suitcase
and then he left
and thats
thats how they got moved
i
oh
do you want a tissue
yeah
do you mind if i just
plop into it real quick
sure
shoot
this can be our last thing
okay
its always what they say
on the days
when you have
a really keen sense
of being lost
or losing something
that it
it often feels like
the sun shines the brightest
and then the next day
there was a really sunny day
with a good breeze
and i just remember thinking
if i was somebody else
i would really be
enjoying this
mmmhmm
whoa geez
okay here it is
so tell me a little bit
about who you put on here
i put first and foremost
my parents catherine and mario
next to each other with a heart
my brother is here and here
and i put my music teacher
the maestro
wow
yeah
i love that one
it sounds like taps
do you know that
yeah do you want
to hear taps
sure
do you feel angry
uh i just feel angry
that we didnt have
a better goodbye
who would you say goodbye to
id like to say goodbye
to my neighbors the costas
goodbye the costas
even though we had
a language barrier
you were my neighbors
you always liked to garden
goodbye richard you were
the worst singer in our class
but i loved how you let me
cut you in line
goodbye anka
your sense of timing
is one of the worst
bye sandra
you were my favorite author
goodbye mrs kim
the time that you ate
a pepper flake
and it made you fly
into the wall
was one of the funniest
yet most serious accidents
any of us ever witnessed
and you bore it
with great grace and bravery
goodbye brad
thank you so much
for rolling that marble
into my bread room
i still keep it to this day

okay now jump really hard

marcel the shell
its a youtube video
my name is marcel
and im partially a shell
my name is marcel
and im a shell as you can see

i
it goes so deep and
they got tattoos

i kind of regret this tattoo
here it is
its like a snail
um i just saw it online
but it was like super puffy
the day after
and i dont know why
and the tattoo guy
couldnt say why
and then
a couple of months later
i found out that i
today im going to be
popping popcorn
with a magnifying glass
so right now we have
theres all these people
and and were all
looking at the same thing
and were all doing
the same thing
were watching the guys
its beautiful and
and it feels like
i dont even know
how to describe it
it feels like something
move move move
its really lovely
are you okay

what does it taste like
oh my gosh
youre gonna love it
so good isnt it
its all been really fun
and having
all this happen and
and uh
you know its so big feeling
and its so nice
um
let it go let it go
the other part of it
is i think i find
my mind wandering a bit
just thinking
what would my family think
and really noticing
that theyre not here
to share it with me
i do wonder what
what my dad would say
what my mom would say
and yeah
i think theyd like it a lot
oh there she goes
oh beautiful
hmm
there must be
so many others like me
its impossible
that there wouldnt be
and not just my family
theyre out there
somewhere out there
every time i do this
that dog goes totally crazy
he sees something
truly elegant in the sky
and this is his reaction
what a sad type of idiot
wow this is
well yeah i dont
think thats gonna yield much
no right but
probably
you know
whats the matter
do you think
they could be out there
uh i mean
maybe
all right i think thats it
we are live streaming
and do i look at you
or should i look
right into the thing
me
quick uh no the camera
its gonna take a picture
okay well
hi everybody
its marcel from before
and im recording this video
because im looking
for my family
they were last seen
with this man
his name is mark
they disappeared from the house
owned by a woman named larissa
here it is
what we do is manage properties
that are on the shortterm
rental market
so if somebodys
out of town for a long time
and just wants to rent a place
for a while we do that
so would you give me her number
if theres a problem
with the property
i can send someone out
but i cant give you
any personal information
uhhuh hey have you
ever eaten a raspberry
hello
darn it
just go for it
this is what they
look like uh right here
and here and here
um i made this
just to give you a sense
of who to be on the lookout for
sorry i think i need
a little help here
dean
hmm
oh dean come on
because of what youre doing
its exciting
its a good scene
you could
you could still film it
you can just put
the thingy on the thing
how would you do it
if i wasnt here
theres a lot of times
where i just dont get stuff
that i need
you are here thats actually
what the truth of it is
yeah but i dont
want to be in it
thats like defeats
the whole point of this
you know dean
have you ever thought that
your life might be
a bit less lonely
and a bit more integrated
if you took the time
to connect with somebody
and not just make videos
about them
thank you
and lastly this picture here

that mark drove away in
it is a teal mishibibi

we got to go
follow for more
celebrity homes
just keep going
huh

are they here to help
mmm
uh
dont feel that
this is the task force
i was hoping for
theres so much nothing
shes the best
she what
but my dad has pink shoes
so did my grandfather
so cute
ugh peace
uh yeah obviously peace
like
what a weird thing
to try to test
to see if someone else is into
like of course im into peace
no sorry
im a real war person
no war actually
i sign all
my personal letters war
let the battle begin
marcel
ugh
you know theres
there is nothing in here
about finding them
its still a group of people
but its an audience
its not
its not a community
theres
man
oh what about the car
what do you mean
mark drove away in a teal car
so we can go look for it
like if we find the car
yeah
i dont think thats like
thats not the way to
wow okay so it actually
doesnt even seem that big
i mean its big
but what we just need to do
is get up high
and then maybe
well be able to spot his car
mmm
whats like your mantel
like when i need to
look out over the whole rug
i get up high
i get up on the mantel
do you see what im saying
cause i can see
yeah no i got it
yeah
great so well just head up
to the top of this thing
and then
well be able to see it
i dont think
well necessarily be able
to see it
i actually disagree
i dont think
its a good idea because
if were if we dont
have like a plan
then were just
sort of flying blind
and we might just
waste a lot of time
going around in circles
just put that there
whats that for its
just in case we get in a fight
were not
gonna get in any fights
you said it was dangerous
out there
its dangerous in a different way
so and you know what else
i should probably
bring this match
you dont need that
uh just give me
one more minute
i need some sort of a helmet

youve got
a little bit of a raisin

sorry but dont stand
right in front of it
finally this is the sparkler
what you do is you light

as a flare all right
why would i need it thats
if you need to signal for help
and deans gonna leave you
his phone just in case
what no im not
who will see the flare
you know what now that
im thinking about it

me too
she probably felt tired
especially after
being very excited
have you ever done that before
like when theres a party
in your house
sometimes its easiest to rest
when you go off by yourself
and you can still hear
the noise of the party
and you feel safe knowing that
so many people are around
yeah
that you can have a rest
mmmhmm

a vibrant past

oh okay
hey dean hey marcel
this is shari from 60 minutes
um i wanted to let you know
that the interview went great
weve been looking
at the footage
and im wondering
if you would be willing to do
another day of shooting with us
so um
weve made some discoveries
that id love to share with you
its kinda all happening fast
so if you could get back to me
as soon as you get this message
i would really appreciate it
um hope to talk
to you soon bye
good things
come in small packages
an old idea but one youll
see tonight in a new light
in the only interview hes given
since becoming
an internet phenom
marcel the shell
shares his unique perspective
on what we take for granted
he adds new meanings
to the simplest of ideas
marcel a 1 inchtall shell
reminds us of
the true value of community
the transformative power
of friendship
and the most ingenious use
for a tennis ball
but if you wanna make sure
that your parking space is
like perfectly flat
because otherwise its not
gonna be where you left it
and and i dont have
the model
for years marcel
and his grandmother connie
shared this old house
with their pet lint alan
and an everchanging array
of human guests
i just stay
out of their way and
and stay out of sight
and it worked
but all that changed
when an amateur filmmaker
moved in
so kind of on all the time
and so i felt like
i could just roll
and roll and roll
um dean what were
your first impressions
uh i guess
i was impressed with his um
pizzazz
his spark you know
wow
uh pfft
no i i like it
and maybe you needed
needed the connection
needed the friendship
yeah maybe you needed
the friendship
marcel how long has it been
since youve seen your family
well i dont do the clock
the way that you guys
do the clock
right
uh but i think
im watching the changes
in the trees and
the flowers that have bloomed
and the blossoms
that have fallen
the buds that have come
and bloomed again
so i i couldnt tell you
but i uh
the space in my heart gets
bigger and louder every day
mmm dean
do you know how long
it was two years
two years
yeah
oh thats nice to know
given all the new
information marcel shared with us
and he had just like
the same kind of man face
like two eyes
that kind of thing
a mouth and all the teeth
we were able
to track down larissa geller
we found her here
in the highlands of guatemala
working for
an environmental ngo
geller then returned home
and helped us locate this man
her former boyfriend
mark booth
i dont even wanna do this youre
really putting me in a tough spot here
all right ill see you soon
come on
okay bye
this is ridiculous
wait are you still
after some
brief introductions
this is mark
hey sorry
its kind of messy
im just sort of
so i was cleaning earlier
right
the search efforts began
i mean i dont know
this is
i dont even know
where else to look
i honestly dont know what
to do i dont know the area
this is definitely the bag
so that that is good news
im not gonna get im not
gonna start to feel down
and then
marcel heard a familiar sound
yeah and then
you just came over
what our crew heard
was an argument
you were on all of the emails
but what marcel heard
was the sounding
of an alarm
im a child
yes
oh dur the sock drawer
did we check the sock drawer
an alarm he knew would send
any shells into a shelter plan
geez its over here
hey guys over here
over here i need a boost
hey i need to get to the top
yeah yeah yeah yeah
open the top drawers somebody
be careful
be very very careful
open open careful
what followed
was something we rarely see
a family reuniting
marcel was always a performer
he always wanted to um
catherine  mario parents
always wanted to be on stage
make people happy and smile
mmm
and as his mother
sorry
oh mom
oh im sorry
yeah i told you youre gonna
get right into the real stuff
oh yeah okay
uh well we can do this thing
pick it up later or
lets talk about something else

i was thinking
about something else
and thats us in a nutshell
yeah i just
i just was being
most of the innovations

them have really taken off

when youre young

all the time
marcel im being patient

to be patient

each of you
oh well then i accept
one two three
come on
marcel come on lets go
were going ice skating
were going
on the ice skating rink
yeah i saw you skating before
it is different now after
living alone for so long
i find that sometimes
being in a big group is
this is what i wanna
be doing i want to slide down
good i didnt know
that thats what you were
trying to do i thought
you were asking me how i
can be
overwhelming to me
you guys theres
i need to learn
i needed somewhere
that i could come and just
i found myself coming down
here more and more
such a lovely smell
from the dryer sheets
and i i like it because
theres a window
that is always opened
a little crack there
i would stand there
and sometimes id tell her
things ask for advice
or just let sounds
come out of my mouth
and one day i was just sitting
and the wind blew in
and it blew just over the top
of my head in such a way
and the wind blew over
and it made
a beautiful whistling sound
what kind of noise is it
wait shh shh listen
can you hear it
thats it
thats going through my shell
it felt just like her
to lead me to a place
where i would experience
something new and special
it connected me
how i felt like to everything
because if i wasnt there
the sound never would exist
and i felt like
everything was in pieces
and then i stood there
and suddenly
we were one large instrument
i like to go there a lot
because it reminds me
that im not
just one separate piece
rattling around in this place
but that im part of a whole
and i truly enjoy
the sound of myself
connected to everything
im gonna let him out
are you ready
all right
release the hounds
come on do it
im actually really excited
to see him
here it comes
hi bud oh booboo
