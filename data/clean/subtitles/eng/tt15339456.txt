what s that 
i want to start
with some questions 
oh  got it 
is it hard for you 
has it been hard
for you since   
mmm   
not in the way that i think you
would think it would be  but   
uh  it s pretty much
common knowledge
that it takes at least 20 shells
to have a community 
that that s about the minimum
that you need to survive  so   
yeah 
i think at first
i was thinking
we re not gonna make it 
but sometimes you just have
to disregard those rules
and think   well  actually 
the rule is
 that i want to be
having a good life
 and stay alive  and   
and not just survive 
but have a good life 
tell me about
what s life like now 
it    me  uh   
i appreciate
its different beauties 
but it    it s not the way
i would ve done things
if i was still in the group 
but they re not here 
so  that s why i have
the electric mixer 
  ready 
  mmm hmm 
ta da 
i mean 
i don t want my voice in it 
well  that s up to you 
so  stop asking me
questions is what i m saying 
oh  oh  okay 
do your parents work 
have you ever met a chef 
what happens if you break this 
have you ever eaten a raspberry 
um  and what was that like 
are you gonna ask me questions 
hello 
oh  man  this is weird 
i don t want my voice in it 
how am i supposed
to ask you questions 
there are actually
only two of us now 
myself   
   and my grandmother 
nana connie 
back when the man
and the woman lived here 
there were a lot of us 
more sounds and smells
and  uh  things to say
 cause there were
more people to talk to 
  there    a stage 
  all right 
ah  up 
these days  it s quieter 
rolling 
give me some levels 
give    give you some levels 
like   
just  like  talk
a little bit  like  oh  uh   
  hello  my name is   
  darn it 
it s not the first time
i ve done that 
my name is marcel 
and i m partially a shell
as you can see on my body 
but i also have shoes 
and  um  a face 
so  i like that about myself 
and i like myself 
and i have a lot of
other great qualities as well 
that was perfect 
okay 
is this the wild tone right now 
  yes 
  ugh 
just stay still for 30 seconds 
how long you gonna   
what are you trying to do
with all this 
um   
i m making  like 
a little documentary
that i might put online 
  online 
  yeah 
eh  you lost me 
ugh 
are you okay 
itchy  are you recording 
yeah 
right now 
yeah 
oh 
well  what should i be doing 
just  well  don t do anything 
just do whatever
you d normally be doing 
like if i weren t here 
where d you get the rope 
this 
uh  it    i    i ll show you 
i come to the bathroom 
i get these curly hairs 
they re the strongest
 cause you have to uncurl it 
but  um  then you can see
it s really long and strong 
but   
hey  what are you laughing at 
we call  em hardy hairs 
this is the arboretum 
a collection of trees
that a community keeps alive 
but i do like to talk to them 
and plants like to have
classical music played for them 
mozart and brahms 
it helps them grow faster 
this is my bread room 
uh  it s a bedroom 
but i sleep on a piece of bread 
so i   
whoa  sorry 
he s just saying hi 
i actually
like the concept of having a dog 
oh  god  i can smell his face 
but i just tie a hair
to a piece of lint 
and i drag it around 
i love you 
come on  come on 
that s it 
sometimes  people say
that my head is too big
for my body 
and then i say 
 compared to what  
sometimes  if i don t have
a way to itch my itch 
the only thing i can do is
i just stand there 
i just let it get me
and i just   
i just have to scream it out 
he s your best friend 
don t you know any other
guys or   
cool 
hmm  i never get it
the first time 
nope 
oh  dang it 
oh  go  go  go

is this an inhaler 
it s like    it s like a slide
or something   
like  i don t even actually
know what it this is 
where did you get that from 
from one of the people
that stayed here for a night 
why 
did you take anything from me 
mmm   
what is wrong with you 
i didn t know

and disturb
the entire environment 
she doesn t 
she s doing dishes right now 
she s the harbinger
of the vacuum 
i can t tell her to go home 
i mean  that s her
scheduled cleaning 
but why

to clean 
oh  that s you  oh  who s she 
oh    i don t   
oh  wow  wait  what

into like a computer hotel 
sort of  yeah 
why did you decide   
why are you here 
i had to move
out of my old place 
so i m staying here
until i find a new one 
why did you have to move out 
uh  that s personal 
okay 
you never talked to anyone

aw  dang it 
i got to go check on nana connie
if this lady s gonna
be running the vacuum 
this is the rover  ow 
it s a good thing i don t

hopefully  she s right
around the corner here 
and there she is

  yeah  i know 
  i just brought him by 
  you re making what 
a documentary 
it s like   
oh  it s like a movie 
but nobody has any lines 
and nobody even knows what it is
while they re making it 
mmm   
no 
that s sort of a way
to put it  yeah 
no  i just am making
a little video portrait 
  about marcel 
  yeah 
  a    a film 
  uh  yeah 
it s like the truth  kind of 
it s a   
and it s the truth about marcel 
i mean  i hope so 
i guess he could really spin it 
and make me look like a total   
so  this is your garden
out here  huh 
  yes 
  beautiful 
thank you 
thank you for the aromas 
my house was very popular 
i had lots of friends 
and if you told me then 
many years ago 
that i would ve spent
so much time in a garden 
i would ve said 
 are you kidding  
okay  you see these ones 
you can feel them 
they re not quite ripe 
but in a few days 
they would be 
it wasn t easy 
i didn t know anything
about farming 
because when the couple
still lived here 
there was always food 
in the pantry  in the kitchen 
there were stacks
here and there 
but when they went away
the food disappeared 
so  i had to taught myself
how to farm 
 planting  harvesting    
she s always been
a pretty tough cookie 
everything has a function
with her 
there s no one button
that s there for decoration 
  you know what i mean 
  mmm hmm 
she s just like a backhoe 
but i will say you can
really see her tender side
when she s working
with the bugs 
is she okay 
yeah  she s okay 
she s a little loopy 
she had a little bit too much 
uh  nectar 
vino fiore  right  franny 
my community found the bugs
to be deeply unlikeable 
okay  we ll put her
here in the sun 
and in a few seconds 
she ll be dry 
but connie s
made friends with many of them 
and in return  they actually
help her with the gardening 
   at first 
found them a little yucky
but now i see their beauty 
i cannot stand this thing 
because they turn the soil 
they break it   
it s wonderful to have them 
his whole body looks
like his pants are off 
it reminds me
of whoopi goldberg
in sister act 
how she helps them
to do graffiti
in a meaningful way
or something  and   
oh  there she goes 
  oops 
  ow  ow  ow 
she s gone 
uh  sort of 
oh  wow 
what is  uh   
what is this 
  hmm 
  what s that 
what are you doing now
with marcel 
oh  i m making a movie 
uh   
a documentary 
  about marcel 
  yeah 
a documentary  uh  a film 
yeah 
ah  marcel 
you remember  nan 
we were just talking about it 
it s a movie 
and we re doing it
together  but   
  what i just said before 
  that s what you   
and we just joked about it 
  yes 
  it s the truth 
but it s the truth about me   
she has lost a small piece   
   of a very large puzzle 
nan 
nana 
once or twice a week 
i ll find her in here 
snoozing in
the laundry basket and   
is it bad for her to be in here 
yeah  it s not
the safest place to be 
you know  my cousin
fell asleep in a pocket 
and that s why
i don t like the saying 
 everything comes out
in the wash  
because sometimes it doesn t 
or sometimes it does 
and they re just like
a completely different person 
 cause after that 
my cousin would
just sit by the window
and wait for fire trucks
to go by 
guess what i use
to tie my skis to my car 
what 
a hair 
guess what my   
marcel the shell with shoes on
guess   
guess what my skis are 
what 
toe nails from a man 
wait  hold on 
so  you re telling me that
84 different people have
just watched 
yeah  isn t that cool 
yeah 
i mean    geez 
what 
just    wow 
what do you
do when you get bored 
uh  i move around 
i could tell he s
performing a little bit for you 
  you know 
  mmm hmm 
da  da  da  da 
you re giving him a stage 
it s good for him 
one  two   
the stage makes him feel good 
playful  he needs that 
he hasn t been able to get that
since the others
were taken from us 
okay  so do you just want me
to start at the beginning 
i don t actually know
how it started 
but the man and the woman
started to yell at each other
more often than they would
talk to each other 
you d just hear
these big noises from the sky 
and my cousin s house
fell down this one time
when the office door
got slammed 
we started
to have a shelter plan 
we all go to the sock drawer 
and so everyone
will be safe there 
this was a sunday 
and everybody gets together 
and we all watch 60 minutes
as a community 
60 minutes  the   
yeah  so  this is
where we were   
  and   
  every week  all of you 
yeah  we love it 
we just call it  the show  
that s how much we love it 
lesley 
who s lesley 
lesley show 
she likes lesley stahl 
i m lesley stahl   
she blows cases wide open 
and she s got class 
   tonight on 60 minutes 
but   
we could tell
that something was the matter
because the clock
started ticking   
   and it was just
the two of us there 
it was a big one 
and we had   
we had no warning 
what we think is that
everybody scooted
into the sock drawer  and  uh   
and the man just   
   dumped all the drawers
into a suitcase 
and then he left 
and that s   
that s how they got moved 
i   
oh   
do you want a tissue 
yeah 
do you mind if i just
plop into it real quick 
sure 
shoot 
this can be our last thing 
okay 
it s always what they say
on the days
when you have
a really keen sense
of being lost
or losing something 
that it   
it often feels like
the sun shines the brightest 
and then the next day 
there was a really sunny day
with a good breeze 
and i just remember thinking 
 if i was somebody else 
 i would really be
enjoying this  
mmm hmm 
whoa  geez 
okay  here it is 
so  tell me a little bit
about who you put on here 
i put  first and foremost 
my parents  catherine and mario 
next to each other with a heart 
my brother is here and here   
   and i put my music teacher 
the maestro 
wow 
yeah 
i love that one 
it sounds like taps 
do you know that 
yeah  do you want
to hear taps 
sure 
do you feel angry 
uh  i just feel angry
that we didn t have
a better goodbye 
who would you say goodbye to 
i d like to say goodbye
to my neighbors  the costas 
goodbye  the costas 
even though we had
a language barrier 
you were my neighbors 
you always liked to garden 
goodbye  richard  you were
the worst singer in our class 
but i loved how you let me
cut you in line 
goodbye  anka 
your sense of timing
is one of the worst 
bye  sandra 
you were my favorite author 
goodbye  mrs  kim 
the time that you ate
a pepper flake
and it made you fly
into the wall
was one of the funniest
yet most serious accidents
any of us ever witnessed 
and you bore it
with great grace and bravery 
goodbye  brad 
thank you so much
for rolling that marble
into my bread room 
i still keep it to this day 
yep  and that

marcel   
marcel the shell with shoes on 
 when the kush hit    
 kush   what is kush 
i   
it goes so deep  and   
they got tattoos 
it s just so many people  i   
i kind of regret this tattoo 
here it is 
it s like a snail 
um  i just saw it online 
but it was like super puffy
the day after 
and i don t know why 
and the tattoo guy
couldn t say why 
and then 
a couple of months later 
i found out that i   
today  i m going to be
popping popcorn
with a magnifying glass 
so right now we have   
there s all these people 
and    and we re all
looking at the same thing 
and we re all doing
the same thing 
we re watching the guys   
it s beautiful  and   
and it feels like   
i don t even know
how to describe it 
it feels like something 
move  move  move 
it s really lovely 
are you okay 
yes  yes  i m okay  i m okay 
so  are you going to eat it 
you can eat this stuff 
yeah  dude 
what does it taste like 
oh  my gosh 
you re gonna love it 
so good  isn t it 
it s all been really fun 
and having
all this happen  and   
and  uh   
you know  it s so big feeling 
and it s so nice 
um   
let it go  let it go 
the other part of it
is i think i find
my mind wandering a bit
just thinking 
what would my family think 
and really noticing
that they re not here
to share it with me 
i do wonder what   
what my dad would say 
what my mom would say 
and  yeah   
i think they d like it a lot 
oh  there she goes 
oh  beautiful 
hmm 
there must be
so many others like me 
it s impossible
that there wouldn t be 
and not just my family 
they re out there 
somewhere out there 
every time i do this 
that dog goes totally crazy 
he sees something
truly elegant in the sky 
and this is his reaction 
what a sad type of idiot 
wow  this is   
well  yeah  i don t
think that s gonna yield much 
no  right  but   
  probably 
  you know   
what s the matter 
do you think
they could be out there 
uh  i mean   
maybe 
all right  i think that s it 
we are live streaming 
and do i look at you 
or should i look
right into the thing 
me 
quick  uh  no  the camera 
it s gonna take a picture 
okay  well   
hi  everybody 
it s marcel from before 
and i m recording this video
because i m looking
for my family 
they were last seen
with this man 
his name is mark 
they disappeared from the house
owned by a woman named larissa 
here it is 
what we do is manage properties
that are on the short term
rental market 
so if somebody s
out of town for a long time
and just wants to rent a place
for a while  we do that 
so would you give me her number 
if there s a problem
with the property 
i can send someone out 
but i can t give you
any personal information 
uh huh  hey  have you
ever eaten a raspberry 
hello 
darn it 
just go for it 
this is what they
look like  uh  right here 
and here and here 
um  i made this
just to give you a sense
of who to be on the lookout for 
sorry  i think i need
a little help here 
dean 
hmm 
oh  dean  come on 
because of what you re doing 
it s exciting 
it s a good scene 
you could   
you could still film it 
you can just put
the thingy on the thing 
how would you do it
if i wasn t here 
there s a lot of times
where i just don t get stuff
that i need 
you are here  that s actually
what the truth of it is 
yeah  but i don t
want to be in it 
that s  like  defeats
the whole point of this 
you know  dean 
have you ever thought that   
your life might be
a bit less lonely
and a bit more integrated
if you took the time
to connect with somebody
and not just make videos
about them 
thank you 
and lastly  this picture here
shows the car
that mark drove away in 
it is a teal mishibibi 
  mitsubishi 
  mitsi ibitsy 
  and   
  mitsubishi 
what is it 
mitsubishi 
mitsubatbitsubisy 
please leave any tips
or any helpful comments
in the section below 
thank you  have a great day 
update  guys 
i think we found it 
it s marcel s house 
it s marcel shell s house 
do you think you can
get in there right now 
  oh  someone  s coming 
  go 
we got to go 
follow for more
  celebrity homes 
  just keep going 
huh 
are they   
are they here to help 
mmm   
uh   
don t feel that
this is the task force
i was hoping for 
there s so much nothing 
 she s the best  
 she   what 
but my dad has pink shoes 
so did my grandfather 
so cute 
ugh  peace 
uh  yeah  obviously peace 
like   
what a weird thing
to try to test
to see if someone else is into 
like  of course i m into peace 
no  sorry 
i m a real war person 
no  war actually 
i sign all
my personal letters   war  
 let the battle begin 
marcel  
ugh 
you know  there s   
there is nothing in here
about finding them 
it s still a group of people 
but it s an audience 
it s not   
it s not a community 
there s   
man 
oh  what about the car 
what do you mean 
mark drove away in a teal car 
so we can go look for it 
like  if we find the car   
yeah 
i don t think that s like   
that s not the way to   
wow  okay  so it actually
doesn t even seem that big 
i mean  it s big
but what we just need to do
is get up high 
and then maybe
we ll be able to spot his car 
mmm   
what s  like  your mantel 
like  when i need to
look out over the whole rug 
i get up high 
i get up on the mantel 
do you see what i m saying 
 cause i can see   
yeah  no  i got it 
yeah 
great  so we ll just head up
to the top of this thing 
and then
we ll be able to see it 
i don t think
we ll necessarily be able
to see it 
i actually disagree 
i don t think
it s a good idea because
if we re    if we don t
have  like  a plan 
then we re just 
sort of  flying blind 
and we might just
waste a lot of time
going around in circles 
just put that there   
what s that for  it s
just in case we get in a fight 
we re not
gonna get in any fights 
you said it was dangerous
out there 
it s dangerous in a different way 
so    and you know what else 
i should probably
bring this match 
you don t need that 
uh  just give me
one more minute 
i need some sort of a helmet 
all right 
so you ve got the book 
you ve got
a little bit of a raisin 
which i really don t think
you re gonna finish 
but you can go to town 
go to town 
also  you have
two drips of   
look over here 
what 
you have two drips of water 
you got an led flashlight
in case the power goes out 
you just got to step on it
like this  see 
see how it    whoa 
what 
sorry  but don t stand
right in front of it 
finally  this is the sparkler 
what you do is you light
this end on fire 
and then you step back 
this can act
as a flare  all right 
why would i need it  that s
if you need to signal for help 
and dean s gonna leave you
his phone just in case 
what  no  i m not 
who will see the flare 
you know what  now that
i m thinking about it 
why don t we just
put the colander over you now
if you want 
all right  how s that 
you must let me out of here 
do you want
alan in there with   
  oh  my god 
  it s okay 
i m so sorry

how many of those
do you take  don t take a lot 
i m not taking 
 cause i don t know how   
when i m gonna get another one 
this is how i live 
we just had to work so hard
just to do this 
just to find
new ways of doing things
and learning
how to survive on our own 
and i guess it s   
i don t wanna end up
with less    than what i have 
i can t make
this decision for you  but   
no  you re not  i ve already
made it for myself 
   this is a really good way to find them 
  i said no 
he s no fun to be around  is he 
do    do you have
any corner pieces over there 
i want you to do it 
no  nan  no  and we already   
we told them no 
but don t you want
to meet lesley stahl 
we need quiet  nana 
we don t need a lot of people
coming in here and   
you don t   
you don t need quiet for me 
i don t want quiet 
oh 
nope 
i think you should do it 
you know  we re just
flying blind  i don t   
i don t even know what we re
supposed to be making here 
what is this even a picture of 
do you have any blue pieces 
he seems   
he s bound up  isn t he 
mmm 
i think he s afraid of
change 
scary 
especially after
what we went through 
but life s not
gonna go on unless   
if you don t 
if you don t open up  right 
do you know that  dean 
heh  heh  heh 
who among us hasn t wished   
   we could read
someone else s mind 
know exactly
what they re thinking 
well  that s impossible 
of course   
i want him to   
i want him to dive in life 
you know 
mmm hmm 
i m not gonna
be here forever  hmm 
you know what i mean 
uh  yeah  i think
he s just worried that   
maybe he ll feel   
he ll sort of lighten up
when you re feeling better 
better 
yeah 
feeling better 
better  better  better  hmm 
t t t t t tch  better 
connie 
nan 
huh 
it s weird because i did think
i heard her up  listen   
what the   
nan 
are you   
look how fun this is  look 
  you re just out here 
  look  i had forgotten how fun   
yeah  how long
have you been out here 
look  i can   
oh  what is going on right   
nan  you re really   
i have to work on my aim 
but look  look  look 
yeah  i see that 
i ve been trying to get it 
i never understood the words 
but i could do it with   
dean  yeah 
i don t wanna
get ahead of myself 
but she seems to suddenly
have a lot more energy 
do you know what that is 
  it s the   
  they play that
  before the sports 
  yeah  before sports 
it means
the sports are starting 
what kind of sports
do you watch 
they like running after balls
or squash them 
kicking 
put them over  like  a net
sometimes  they do that 
but the net is a hole  so
it comes right out 
right  so it s just like 
why do you put it back in 
  it s really strange 
  i do notice 
i think  that she s definitely
been eating better 
mmm  my favorite 
nope  not for you 
bup  nan  you really   
did you just eat
that whole thing 
oh  yes  of course 
i love shish kebab

why did you
divorce her  was your wife   
she s great 
we just grew apart 
you okay 
i m totally fine 
are you sure 
maybe you should be resting or   
nan  maybe we ll think of   
who decided to leave 
  you or her 
  it was pretty mutual 
you don t fool me 
it s never mutual 
and she s    she s got
some of her color back 
you re broken 
you re making
  this documentary to   
  oh  my   
so you don t
have to think of her 
is that why 
 cause he s heartbroken 
are you heartbroken  dean 
he s laughing  so maybe
he s not so heartbroken 
look at her 
she s just completely
bounced back  it s like   
completely 
  100  
  wow

those genes

to the toilet
and sits on the rim 
nan 
  you checked her room  yeah 
  no 
yeah  do you want    i mean 
should we go over   
oh  yeah  yeah 
next   
hmm 
i m glad i got to meet her 
me  too 
she probably felt tired 
especially after
being very excited 
have you ever done that before 
like  when there s a party
in your house 
sometimes it s easiest to rest
when you go off by yourself
and you can still hear
the noise of the party 
and you feel safe knowing that
so many people are around   
yeah 
   that you can have a rest 
mmm hmm 
that s good  and now this one 
she was exactly what you would
want a grandmother to be 
she had a   
a vibrant past 
and a colorful personality 
and she didn t get sanded down
by life

i don t know 
you re it  baby 
oh  okay 
hey  dean  hey  marcel 
this is shari from 60 minutes 
um  i wanted to let you know
that the interview went great 
we ve been looking
at the footage
and i m wondering
if you would be willing to do
another day of shooting with us 
so  um 
we ve made some discoveries
that i d love to share with you 
it s kinda all happening fast 
so if you could get back to me
as soon as you get this message 
i would really appreciate it 
um  hope to talk
to you soon  bye 
good things
come in small packages   
   an old idea  but one you ll
see tonight in a new light 
in the only interview he s given
since becoming
an internet phenom 
marcel the shell
shares his unique perspective
on what we take for granted 
he adds new meanings
to the simplest of ideas 
marcel  a 1 inch tall shell 
reminds us of
the true value of community 
the transformative power
of friendship 
and the most ingenious use
for a tennis ball 
but if you wanna make sure
that your parking space is 
like  perfectly flat 
because otherwise  it s not
gonna be where you left it 
and    and i don t have
the model   
for years  marcel
and his grandmother connie
shared this old house
with their pet lint  alan 
and an ever changing array
of human guests 
i just stay
out of their way and   
and stay out of sight 
and it worked 
but all that changed
when an amateur filmmaker
moved in 
   so kind of on all the time 
and so  i felt like
i could just roll
and roll and roll 
um  dean  what were
your first impressions 
uh  i guess
i was impressed with his  um 
pizzazz   
     his spark  you know 
  wow 
uh  pfft 
no  i    i like it 
and maybe you needed   
needed the connection 
needed the friendship 
yeah  maybe you needed
the friendship 
marcel  how long has it been
since you ve seen your family 
well  i don t do the clock
the way that you guys
do the clock 
right 
uh  but i think
i m watching the changes
in the trees and
the flowers that have bloomed
and the blossoms
that have fallen 
the buds that have come
and bloomed again 
so i    i couldn t tell you 
but i  uh   
the space in my heart gets
bigger and louder every day 
mmm  dean 
do you know how long 
it was two years 
  two years 
  yeah 
oh  that s nice to know 
given all the new
information marcel shared with us   
   and he had just  like
the same kind of man face 
like two eyes 
that kind of thing 
a mouth and all the teeth 
   we were able
to track down larissa geller 
we found her here
in the highlands of guatemala
working for
an environmental ngo 
geller then returned home
and helped us locate this man 
her former boyfriend 
mark booth 
i don t even wanna do this  you re
really putting me in a tough spot here   
all right  i ll see you soon 
   come on 
okay  bye 
this is ridiculous 
wait  are you still   
after some
brief introductions   
  this is mark 
  hey  sorry 
it s kind of messy 
i m just sort of   
  so i was cleaning earlier 
  right 
   the search efforts began 
i mean  i don t know 
this is   
i don t even know
where else to look 
i honestly don t know what
to do  i don t know the area 
this is definitely the bag 
so that    that is good news 
i m not gonna get    i m not
gonna start to feel down   
and then
marcel heard a familiar sound 
yeah  and then
you just came over   
what our crew heard
was an argument

of an alarm

come on 
marcel  come on  let s go 
we re going ice skating 
we re going
on the ice skating rink 
yeah  i saw you skating before 
it is different now after
living alone for so long 
i find that sometimes
being in a big group is   
this is what i wanna
be doing  i want to slide down 
good  i didn t know
that that s what you were
trying to do  i thought
you were asking me how i   
   can be
overwhelming to me 
you guys  there s   
i need to learn 
i needed somewhere
that i could come and just   
i found myself coming down
here more and more 
such a lovely smell
from the dryer sheets 
and i    i like it because
there s a window
that is always opened
a little crack there 
i would stand there 
and sometimes i d tell her
things  ask for advice 
or just let sounds
come out of my mouth 
and one day  i was just sitting 
and the wind blew in 
and it blew just over the top
of my head in such a way 
and the wind blew over 
and it made
a beautiful whistling sound 
what kind of noise is it 
wait  shh  shh  listen 
can you hear it 
that s it 
that s going through my shell 
it felt just like her
to lead me to a place
where i would experience
something new and special 
it connected me
how i felt like to everything 
because if i wasn t there 
the sound never would exist 
and i felt like
everything was in pieces 
and then i stood there 
and suddenly 
we were one large instrument 
i like to go there a lot
because it reminds me
that i m not
just one separate piece
rattling around in this place 
but that i m part of a whole 
and i truly enjoy
the sound of myself
connected to everything 
i m gonna let him out 
are you ready 
all right 
release the hounds 
come on  do it 
i m actually really excited
to see him 
here it comes 
hi  bud  oh  boo boo

oh  you smell 
oh  my goodness

i switched him to wet food 
and it s made
his breath go crazy 
it is a very dense 
very rich aroma 
  arthur
