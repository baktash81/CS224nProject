so  for some  this story begins
on the shores of france 
two men  once enemies  whose
paths first  crossed in battle 
now face different roads
in their journey as friends 
tarik 
this won t be the same without you 
what will i do with myself
when you re not praying five times a day 
do exactly the same thing you
would do when i was praying 
that s impossible   cause i
was stealing your food 
come with me to england 
come with me to spain  we ll
find el cabillo together 
we ll continue our adventures 
i can t  the only adventure
i seek at the moment
are two head of cattle
and an acre of farmland 
always the hopeless romantic 
hey 
i hate it when you do that 
others said it began the same day
with the escape of father bernard 
i was going to tie your feet together 
but i want to see you kick 
the shepherd on the run from his flock 
 father bernard shouting 
 crowd shouting 
but most say it began right here in england
with the disappearance of princess lunna
on the eve of her wedding 
 growling 
 growling 
 girl shouts 
 man shouting 
come here 
would you look at this 
i m busy 
 liquid tinkling 
come here  you really need to see this 
maybe the old rope trick 
the old rope trick 
praise god  my son 
you saved my  my   
you are a moor 
narrator  so  tarik headed off to
spain in search for adventure
and the legendary mercenary el cabillo 
whilst george rowed him to england 
the word of god warms the soul 
but good wine warms the belly 
no 
i have to ask you  uh  about  uh   
how did a christian knight
befriend a muslim moor 
that s quite simple  really 
tried to cut my head off 
i was in jerusalem  in the
ruins of a small building
with two arab men  one was dead 
the other was mortally wounded 
i was kneeling over the man
when tarik came into the building 
and why didn t he kill you 
because he realized i wasn t
trying to kill the man 
i was giving him water
to ease his suffering 
the man was tarik s own brother 
so  uh  what are your plans now 
hopefully find a quiet place to settle down 
perhaps find a wife 
but first  i have family to visit 
narrator  here in the forest 
men search for the missing princess 
none more so than lord de gurney 
for he had much to lose 
the king had given him the princess s hand 
and once wed  he would have
the power and riches he coveted 
whether the princess loved him or not 
he would marry her and rule the kingdom 
but no one thought  dragon  
they had long since become legend 
but looking back  this story really began
when george returned to the village of loar 
and our paths crossed for the first time 
are you lost  sir  and where is your horse 
i m not lost  and i have no horse 
i m here to find sir robert 
he ll be old now 
he s still there  and he s
still old  i m wryn 
george 
very pleased to meet you  wryn 
sir robert 
oh  i ll take you to him 
thank you  kind sir 
 laughs 
you be careful with that lance  boy 
 knocking at door 
george  hello  is there anybody home 
my eyes may be weak  but even after 15 years
i know the voice of my own
son  come here  my boy 
i never gave up hope  i knew you d come back 
so often i dreamt i was there 
fighting alongside of you 
 knocking at door 
sir robert  may we come in 
yes  yes  come in  my son 
the hero  prepare a feast 
bulchar  shall we cook him first
or eat him on the hoof 
i don t know  bulchar 
he looks a little tough 
he might need a little tenderizing 
so you are the famous el cabillo 
i was hoping you could teach me something 
if you re looking
for a teacher  you ve
made a very poor choice 
i only have 4 lessons  and sadly
my students always seem to fail 
get this man a weapon 
this better be worth my while 
lesson number 1   always
expect the unexpected 
 laughs 
and i thought this was going to be easy 
oh  it s gonna be easy all right 
 shouts 
lesson number 2   never take
your eyes off your opponent 
lesson number 3   never
underestimate your opponent 
well  moor  that s the best you got 
our lessons are almost over 
 shouts 
lesson number 4 
always cheat 
 men laughing 
best stick with your bow  son 
is it true that the muslims eat the
heart and liver of the knights they kill 
no  no  they only eat the heart 
the liver they feed to the horses 
 all laugh 
give them no mind  wryn 
wryn  i wish i d been there with you 
what s that 
it s a curious thing  isn t it 
it was given to me by a muslim friend 
a muslim friend  surely your jest 
no  father 
it looks like the devil s pitchfork 
then that s what i should call it  a pitch 
where will adventure take you next  my son 
well  father  i    i want to settle down 
nonsense  settle down 
you ve got two perfectly good legs 
my blood running through your
veins  the blood of conquest 
oh  father  i was thinking of
trying to find some land 
perhaps north of the grampians 
still a hopeless romantic 
you d be wiser to go east  fewer brigands 
and no dragons 
you re still telling tall stories
of dragons  father  huh 
not tall stories  facts  dragons 
the most fearsome creatures
who ever walked this earth 
and there s still one out
there  as you know by this   
the lance 
the other end of it is still stuck
fast inside of her  yes 
aye  and one day  lad  you ll
go bring that half back to me 
i think you may finally
be ready for this gift 
something i ve been saving for you 
a dragon horn 
made from a claw from its foot 
makes a sound only a dragon can hear 
and you saw this dragon  sir robert 
with your own two eyes 
with my own two legs  to be more precise 
whatever you say  father 
i appreciate this gift 
but my days of conquest are over 
to england 
 growls 
gently  gently  all right 
put it down  there we go 
now  when you arrive in crail  find
king edgaar  he s a good man 
edgaar will recognize that dragon
horn i gave you and know i sent you 
will he have some land 
if that s what you seek  but i
know what lies inside you 
here  farewell  mother 
george 
goodbye  father 
fare ye well  all of you 
come 
 horses neigh 
if anyone here were half the man i am 
we might still have a princess 
 horse neighs 
okay  come on  everyone  there s
another way round we can go 
ouch 
woman  he could chop my firewood 
ouch 
man  see the two headed goats 
just one tin sovereign 
 loud talking and laughing 
men  oh 
 prisoner shouting 
 loud thump 
see what you think about that 
nothing like a drop of ale to wash
the dust of the road from your throat 
you re right there  sir  i ll
tell you something  too 
the finest ale this side of the
grampians  thank you 
could you tell me where i
might find king edgaar 
the king  uh  well 
normally he d be  he d be right
over there enjoying a drink 
the king  here 
oh  yes  yes  yes  yes 
when i say my ale is fit
for a king  i mean it 
i was told he may have
some land he could sell 
i m afraid you ve had a long journey 
and it may have been wasted 
you see  the thing is  three days ago
the king got word that his
daughter disappeared 
not been out of the house  i doubt
he will be  til she s found 
it s a bad business 
i have some time to kill 
anyone wanting to buy land around here 
must have a fair few coins in his purse 
not as many as you think  friend 
my friends here would all
like another tankard of ale 
let s just check those coins
again  see if we can t   
i don t think you want any trouble 
i wouldn t mind some 
garth  be very careful what you wish for 
lord de gurney 
i suggest you remember your place 
batley  my lord  he put me up
to it  it was all his big idea 
get out of here 
lord de gurney 
george of loack 
i can arrange a meeting with the
king if you like  after you 
thank you  my lord 
what news  lord de gurney 
none yet  sire  but my men
and i will continue to search 
was there no sign of her at all 
no  sire 
but i am convinced it was the picts 
picts  those savages 
they could do anything to
her  anything at all 
mark my words  sire  i will
get her back unharmed 
she is your daughter  but she s
also my betrothed 
then i will join you  for princess
lunna i d follow the devil himself 
sire  i fear it might be
a little too dangerous   
any man who joins in the search
for my daughter has my blessing 
 clears throat 
um  perhaps  my liege  i
may be of some assistance 
my lord  may i introduce sir   
my lord  if i may be so bold 
this is my introduction 
the dragon horn 
how did you come by this  is sir robert dead 
oh  no  no  my good lord  he s old but well 
and prays for your good health and long life 
come here  come closer 
i d know those eyes anywhere  you must be   
george  yes  i m son of sir robert 
nothing could delight me more than to
know that the son of my old comrade in arms
is joining the search  there is a
reward  you know  money is no object 
no  my lord  i seek only one thing 
just a small parcel of land  enough for
a cottage  a garden  two head of cattle 
your modesty touches me 
do you think it s too late 
sire  i m sure she s fine 
i ll wager there isn t a pict
within a day s ride of her 
 sneezes 
it must be the horses 
 man shouts 
so  we took the better half a day
to get around a tree  did we 
if i had a coin for every time you were
late  i could pave this country in gold 
i m sorry  sir  it took a little
longer than we thought 
we have no time for chitchat  d arcy 
we have to make camp by daybreak 
let s see what england has to offer us 
let s go 
would you care for some liquorice 
thank you 
 laughs 
it must be an acquired taste 
and has the princess lunna
acquired the taste 
i do believe she has 
then you re destined to be together 
is there a princess in your life 
no 
no  all the women i ve come across
are more trouble than they re worth 
 laughs 
then you most certainly
have not met my lunna 
she is as gentle and agreeable as a lamb 
i should look forward to
making her acquaintance 
oh 
dismount 
i have scoured these woods for
tracks  and i found none 
so  the picts have wings 
no  they have boats 
they came from the water while the
princess was in the lake 
and they will never suspect
we have them  too 
we do 
i see nothing but trees 
and from trees come boats 
all right  you men dismount 
fell the timber here 
you men from here rear ward  take your
horses and drag the poles to the lake 
and you  give me another roll of liquorice 
care for another  george 
no  no  you keep it for yourself  my lord 
stand aside 
yes  my lord 
shall we 
garth  appears we may have some company 
 men shouting 
george  take this with you 
this is getting us nowhere 
having fun 
can i borrow this 
thank you 
elm s gone looking for trouble 
can you look after these 
i don t need you  just your ax 
ax and you shall receive 
 shouts 
no  come back  my sword 
you all right  elm 
i surely had them on the run 
no  you nearly got yourself killed 
you re lucky i saw you leave 
not that lucky  i m afraid 
 shouting 
come on 
come on  now get up 
get out of here 
whoever you are  we consider you a friend 
please  show yourself 
i know this young archer 
wryn 
if you don t show yourself 
i ll slice up your liver
and have it for dinner 
wryn  you wouldn t really eat
my liver  would you 
i ve half a mind to do exactly
that  now come down here 
george  what are you doing here 
you looked like you could use some help 
we were in a bit of a bind 
i m wryn from loar 
elmendorf of crail  good to
meet you  young wryn 
i ve heard of loar 
do you mind 
now we have to take this child back to loar 
you can t take me back 
you need me  i saved your life 
the boy does have a point 
have you both taken leave of your senses 
this journey is far too dangerous
to be undertaken by a child 
we can take him as far as the
abbey of saint germain  near torgyle 
well  you leave us little choice now 
wonderful  let s get back to the camp
and we ll retrieve the cart
and princess lunna s things 
and then i won t have to ride
that infernal horse any longer 
come on 
i swear  i swear  we haven t
got anything of value here 
your eyes tell me you re lying 
my mouth s telling the truth 
honestly  we ve got nothing 
go on 
no  no  please  don t hang me upside down 
get nose bleeds 
i can smell a lie like horses
smell water  do it 
no  no  look   
even the king s daughter s disappeared 
she was the only valuable thing we had 
wait 
a princess 
yeah 
a ransom 
yeah  a great big ransom  apparently 
a knight s gone looking for her 
he didn t want the reward  all
he wanted was    what was it 
oh  yeah  a little parcel of
land and two head of cattle 
what a fool  eh  you d take the
money  wouldn t you 
let s find the princess  string him up 
what  no  that s no fair 
no  i m getting a nose bleeding 
i knew i would  i told them 
wryn  george 
those picts weren t so tough after all 
i m sure they didn t fare any better
against lord de gurney  either 
 buzzing 
what is that 
how old is it 
ten days 
yuk 
maybe a fortnight 
anything wrong 
no  no 
just thinking we need to move on 
we ll stop here 
the sky is clearing  be
able to see the stars soon 
my father once said if i was worthy enough 
they d name one of those after me 
what s that  over there 
it s a fire 
we should break camp 
wryn  what are you doing  stay here 
stay here 
oy 
useless 
 hissing 
 meowing 
try that again  and there s
another one where that came from 
get away from that 
no  you get away 
princess lunna  thank god you re
safe  you ve no idea wha   
george  princess lunna 
this is the little lamb we ve come to find 
oh  elm  i knew you d come 
subdue this fool  this one 
holding the sword which is too large for him 
no  no  no  princess  you don t understand 
your father sent this fool 
this gentleman  sir george  to find you 
oh 
very well  but no one
is going to harm this egg 
what kind of egg is that 
it s a dragon s egg  and its name is smite 
may i touch it 
wryn  you stay put 
i m getting you out of here  and
then i m gonna destroy that thing 
you re not getting me anywhere  i was
doing perfectly well until you showed up 
really 
because you look very cold
and extremely hungry to me 
i ve got something for you 
wryn  come and help me 
sh  don t speak to me 
i wasn t planning on it 
if you came to kill a dragon 
you came to the wrong place 
i came to find you 
where there s a baby  there s a mother 
adelaide died 
adelaide 
that s what i called her 
she had a terrible wound 
two days ago  she just crawled off
into the lake and didn t come back 
smite may be the last dragon god ever
creates  and i intend to protect him 
oh 
so  you are hungry 
perhaps 
i might just have something for you 
i d eat anything 
ugh 
it s liquorice  garth told me   
garth  he doesn t know the
first thing about me 
that s the worst substance i ve ever eaten 
very well put 
lunna  i brought some of your things
from the campsite  there you are 
and i ve brought you a
special piece of venison 
oh  elm  you always were so thoughtful 
wryn  thank you 
hey 
you scared me 
sorry 
it s gonna be a long day tomorrow 
better get some rest 
elm 
you know we can t let it live  don t you 
i don t suppose we   
no 
i ll do the dirty work 
mmm 
tell me wryn 
do you hope one day to be a
hired killer like sir george 
i d like to be a knight if that s
what you re asking  it sounds like fun 
nothing fun about killing 
wryn  it s very dirty 
deeply unpleasant 
and not something i recommend
to anyone at all 
what about you  george 
aren t you so in the business of killing 
i hardly call it a business 
my father must be paying you a fortune 
if you can call an acre of land and
two head of cattle a fortune  then yes 
how curious  a knight who doesn t seek fame 
a mercenary who doesn t seek fortune 
why did you follow this path 
i had no choice 
my path was set down
for me before i was born 
you don t have a choice now 
no  i have a duty 
a duty of honor 
to honor my father  to honor my oath 
perhaps that doesn t make much sense
to a spoiled little princess 
most of us can t be quite as
frivolous as we might like 
but i suppose that  too 
for a girl like you 
is rather difficult to understand 
then i don t suppose you
understand me at all 
elm  are you sure we can t
push the cart up the hill 
i m afraid not  it s far too steep 
then you must promise me to be very careful 
i promise 
should we clear a path in there 
elm  oh  no  not now 
i hope nothing happens to it 
i ve never seen a real dragon 
oh  no  don t you dare 
as the daughter of the king  for the last
time i order you not to harm this egg  ugh 
that s twice  i cannot believe
you ve done that again 
enough is enough 
 shouts 
one day you ll thank me for this 
lunna  i m not leaving without smite 
 men shouting 
the riders are coming 
i m not leaving without him 
george  oh  hang it all 
all right  all right 
but if that thing slows us down 
i swear to you  you ll be the only
one in england wearing dragon skin shoes 
understood 
yeah 
why me 
 all huff and puff 
lunna  elm 
 strains 
elm  are you alright 
george 
 shouts 
lunna  george  watch out for the trees 
ohh   
darling  are you all right 
i think i m fine  thank you 
my little sweetheart 
you brought the egg right to the cart 
thank you  elm 
it would be nice if someone else noticed 
all right  you ve got to get
smite into the cart 
the cart happens to be full of your dresses 
now it ll fit 
i suppose we d better get the egg 
uh huh 
let s go 
ah 
wryn  have you ever seen one of these 
wow  it s better than a bucket of water 
torgyle s about a day s ride from here 
they ll run us down long before then 
thanks to that  we re going
slower than a snail s pace 
maybe we should head towards the mountains 
we have to stay near the
lake in case it hatches 
 growling 
and that might be soon 
 growling 
smells like a princess 
an interesting relic  it
could be worth something 
i ll tell you when i ve sold it 
we re going north 
mountain path 
lake path 
which way 
we need to buy some time 
we can t tell which way
they went  should we split up 
we have to 
take four men and    wait  there 
very clumsy  they make this too easy 
wryn  it s that sound again 
he s not going to stay in there much longer 
this blanket isn t big enough 
i don t suppose we could use your   
no  i don t suppose we could 
 egg growling 
what is this 
they took the lake road 
come on 
i still can t believe you re here 
what s this  have you kidnapped the king 
 nun shouts 
lunna  cousin  calm down 
concentrate  say  rabbits and radishes  
it works 
she s all right  let her go 
i was trying to say
that you re smothering me 
sorry  i couldn t risk being heard 
what is that 
dear cousin  we have a small problem 
it s a big problem  it s a small dragon 
that s about to hatch 
it s a dragon s egg 
woman  sister angela 
is it you causing all this commotion 
and who  may i ask  are your visitors 
mother margaret  this is my beloved
cousin  the princess lunna 
oh  my good lord  what
in heaven s name is that 
it s a dragon s egg  mother superior 
what  but    wh    how is that possible 
i thought they d been extinct
for hundreds of years 
it may be the last of its kind 
i feel compelled to take it to safety
where it can be no harm to anyone 
and where may that be 
i understand her point  mother  but
i fear there is no such place 
it s my belief that this
egg should be destroyed 
i m afraid i agree with you  sir 
sister angela  your friends
are very welcome here 
but that creature  whatever
it is  certainly is not 
see that it is dispatched
as soon as possible 
please  mother margaret 
it s for the best  only god
knows what havoc it will cause
when it hatches  now  sir 
man  actually 
i am of a different opinion 
george  i don t believe my eyes 
you know each other 
we did some boating together at one time 
now these are your friends 
mother margaret and i met many  many 
many years ago 
one  many  would ve been quite sufficient 
and so  this is your path
to peace and tranquility 
i got a little sidetracked 
it would ve been a little less dangerous
if i d gone after el cabillo with tarik 
mother margaret 
something is not evil just because
we don t understand it 
besides  the princess has a unique understanding of creation 
i  for one  am going to listen to her 
but  father bernard 
and as someone else who has a big heart 
i think you should listen to her  as well 
very well  on your own head be it 
but no one else  except for those
of us here  can know about it 
it must hidden in the stables  til
morning  and it must be gone by then 
it will be  i promise 
oh  oh  forgive me  mother 
that s quite all right  child 
restraint is a virtue only
thrust upon the elderly 
may god be with you 
wryn 
sir 
your poor tunic  it s ruined 
we can find something more appropriate
for you when we get inside 
he s a rather handsome
escort  isn t he  cousin 
i don t know what you mean 
what 
um  the tie of my dress   
would you just   
yes  of course 
just tuck it in here 
 tapping 
princess lunna  they told
me you d arrived safely 
my lord 
my lord de gurney  good to see you again 
george 
where did your adventures take you 
most likely on the same
roads that you ve traveled 
i see you ve caught the prize 
it s really not important who
found her  just that she s safe 
now we can take her back to
her father together 
aren t you forgetting something  george 
forgetting what 
our little secret 
oh  no  no  it s really
not what you re thinking 
could you excuse us while we have a word 
do not let me interfere 
thank you  a word 
i m not giving that egg 
you d think they were married 
the way they re carrying on 
lunna 
lunna 
i am so relieved that you
returned to me safe and sound 
are you relieved that i m safe 
or are you relieved we can finally
move forward with your plans 
that you re safe  of course  why 
don t you even wonder what happened to me 
i d a lot of time to think while
i was away  and i ve come to a conclusion 
i will not marry you 
you can t be serious 
your father promised me your hand 
i don t love you  i never did 
 laughs 
lunna 
this is not only about love 
this is about the solvency of our kingdom 
when i marry  it will be about love 
this is about him  isn t it 
i made my decision long before i met george 
you just weren t listening 
elm 
when will they be wed 
lunna and garth  soon  very soon 
george  there s something you must know 
since the crusades  our kingdom
has suffered a great deal 
kind edgaar felt the need
for a strong successor 
someone who may not be as benevolent as he 
one who could unify our people 
garth is that man 
and the king asked his daughter
to marry him  she agreed 
because  unlike what you thought 
she s not selfish and spoiled 
and preserving this egg  well 
it s the first thing she s ever done
that she wasn t told to do 
it is about time 
sorry  sir 
there s been a development
that i had not counted on 
so i must expedite my plan 
the troops are camped about half a
day s ride from here  what can i do 
i need you to get the troops
to dunmeade by midmorning 
i will meet you there with the priest 
and when he s performed the ceremony 
we can move on the old king 
now  i have some work to do here 
so you ll bring the men 
and  d arcy  do not be late 
yes  sir 
 mother superior praying in latin 
utter a word  and it ll be your last 
put these on 
 praying continues 
mo   
what in heaven   
george  come on 
it s lord de gurney  he s taken
princess lunna and father bernard 
i think they were tied 
where 
to the horse 
no  where did he take them 
the road to dunmeade 
i ll get the cart 
i m not taking it  it ll slow us down 
i m the servant of the princess 
i vowed to protect her 
all right  all right 
you protect the egg  i ll
rescue the princess 
now  go  go 
you d better try and secure it 
it won t sit still 
well  do something 
i did it 
wryn  elm 
we ll take him with us 
no  no 
let me go 
this is not what i had
in mind for our wedding 
but since you would not cooperate 
this is where it s going to be 
now  move 
you see  that s not consent  i won t do it 
oh  really 
kill me if you want  i don t fear death 
dearly beloved  we are gathered here today   
yah 
do you  garth de   
i do 
do you  princess   
she does 
i swear you ll regret this  i don t
love you  i don t even like you 
i agreed to our engagement
only to serve my father 
and a proud father he ll be 
he ll go to the grave knowing his
kingdom is in good hands 
come on 
once we re wed  i will be king 
and you will be my   
well  george  just in time 
we need a witness 
the only witnessing i ll be
doing is your certain death 
unless you unhand her 
i ll not only unhand her  i ll
 un arm  her   un leg  her 
and possibly behead her 
unless you put down that sword 
now  let s continue  priest  i ve had
enough of these rude interruptions 
 egg growls 
the riders  the riders 
they re not far behind me 
captain d arcy s arrived on time
