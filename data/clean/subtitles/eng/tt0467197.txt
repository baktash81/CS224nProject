there s an army of bodies under this river 
criminals  people who ran out of time 
out of friends 
next time they drag this river
they will find me on the bottom with the rest of them 
and there won t be anyone left to say i was different 
i could feel the dead down there 
just below my feet 
reaching up to welcome me as one of their own 
it was an easy mistake to make 
all the cold investigations in the city are collected up
and delivered over here to us 
and we call each of the witnesses 
to see if they have anything to add to their original statements 
and if they can t 
then we send the file back to the original precinct for follow up 
don t get your hopes up though 
this is the cold case office 
once you ve been through the file and come up empty  you bring it here 
max here handles all our files 
if it hits his desk  the case is officially dead 
so what if there s no phone number for a witness 
  should i do a follow up in person 
  no  no  we don t do that kind of stuff down here 
i don t understand  then how   
how am i supposed to solve the unsolvable murder mystery and redeem myself 
  man  internal affairs   
  stop 
alright  trust me  there s a tragic story behind
why i m standing here giving you this tour 
we all did something  so just save it 
what do you say  we grab a beer after work or something 
  so what s his story 
  there is none 
  but back there you said   
  listen 
his wife and kid were murdered 
they never found the guy  that s the story 
remember when you were a kid
 and you d hold your breath when you went past the graveyard 
just leave that man alone 
yo  homey  that s a really nice watch 
kinda reminds me of the one i lost 
you didn t lose it  you pawned it up on 128th a few hours ago 
ask doug  he was there with you

from the dawn of time
great generals have always known the one fundamental truth of warfare 
morale wins battles 
thanks to the breakthroughs made by aesir pharmaceuticals
the military of tomorrow will be able to unlock the limitless potential
insde every soldier 
introducing valkyr  the strength of freedom 
that s what this is about  a drug 
how is your experience of combat improved
since taking the drug valkyr 
well  i m never scared for starters 
describe to me  if you will 
how is valkyr winning the war on terror 
you face down a group of insurgents and instead of fear
you re filled with peace  i guess 
it s like something s watching over you from above 
you feel like you have wings 
so when you say you feel stronger  more secure  more capable 
definitely  it s just whatever it takes to win the war out there 
you feel indestructible  nothing can stop me 
i can face anything 
have you noticed any side effects 
i can only speak for myself and no 
i apologize 
  you wanna do it again

what was i supposed to do  michelle kept nosing around 
some boxes from the dead project went missing 
she mentionned it to me without knowing what it really meant  i had to   
i had to talk to her 
show her my side before she took it to someone else 
before that night   
the things that went wrong for me seemed impossible to do anything about 
michelle was the first problem in my life 
small enough to reach out and stop 
once that happened
i realized i could use the strength of my hands
to keep one thing from being taken away from me 
at the time michelle stopped screaming that night 
i d learned the most amazing lesson 
i could keep doing this my entire life 
i was a new person that night 
and from there 
figuring out how to put the drug on the street 
how to make use of lupino and the rest of them 
it was easy 
but only because of michelle 
the first problem i really solved for myself 
ok  enough 
enough of this shit 
bb 
it s not like we didn t see it coming 
sullen  withdrawn  max just never seemed the same after the tragedy 
grab me some of that rope
