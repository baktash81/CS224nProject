theres an army of bodies under this river
criminals people who ran out of time
out of friends
next time they drag this river
they will find me on the bottom with the rest of them
and there wont be anyone left to say i was different
i could feel the dead down there
just below my feet
reaching up to welcome me as one of their own
it was an easy mistake to make
all the cold investigations in the city are collected up
and delivered over here to us
and we call each of the witnesses
to see if they have anything to add to their original statements
and if they cant
then we send the file back to the original precinct for followup
dont get your hopes up though
this is the cold case office
once youve been through the file and come up empty you bring it here
max here handles all our files
if it hits his desk the case is officially dead
so what if theres no phone number for a witness
should i do a followup in person
no no we dont do that kind of stuff down here
i dont understand then how
how am i supposed to solve the unsolvable murder mystery and redeem myself
man internal affairs
stop
alright trust me theres a tragic story behind
why im standing here giving you this tour
we all did something so just save it
what do you say we grab a beer after work or something
so whats his story
there is none
but back there you said
listen
his wife and kid were murdered
they never found the guy thats the story
remember when you were a kid
and youd hold your breath when you went past the graveyard

what are you doing here

cuff him
what was i supposed to do michelle kept nosing around
some boxes from the dead project went missing
she mentionned it to me without knowing what it really meant i had to
i had to talk to her
show her my side before she took it to someone else
before that night
the things that went wrong for me seemed impossible to do anything about
michelle was the first problem in my life
small enough to reach out and stop
once that happened
i realized i could use the strength of my hands
to keep one thing from being taken away from me
at the time michelle stopped screaming that night
id learned the most amazing lesson
i could keep doing this my entire life
i was a new person that night
and from there
figuring out how to put the drug on the street
how to make use of lupino and the rest of them
it was easy
but only because of michelle
the first problem i really solved for myself
ok enough
enough of this shit
bb
its not like we didnt see it coming
sullen withdrawn max just never seemed the same after the tragedy
