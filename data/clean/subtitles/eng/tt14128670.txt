between kimi and products
like siri or alexa
well sharon i will tell you
the difference between kimi and those
other products you mention
by name people
its our people and their level
of excellence that sets us apart
the voice interpolation on kimi
is a perfect example
we dont have an algorithm trying to
figure out what you said or what you meant
we have actual people
analyzing kimi requests
so we can continually update our
understanding of how you communicate
who you are what you want
so youre listening
to everything
no not at all we are flagging miscommunication
so kimi can better understand you
and we do this every day
think of it this way kimi understands
you better today than it did yesterday
because of our people
is that efficient
its actually the fastest way to get
better fast if that makes any sense
the bottom line is
its working
you pushed for the amygdala
corporation to go public
the idea the timing mostly yours
how are you feeling
i feel great
ive been saying since i was
brought in two years ago
kimi is the future
of this company
it just seemed obvious to me
and the board agrees
but talk to me in a week after the
ipo if youll give me the time
i absolutely will
bradley hasling ceo of the amygdala
corporation thank you for joining us

a week before the ipo
i thought it might
have been a crime
delete it
did you hear me
i thought it might have been a crime
yeah the devices
pick up things lots of things
and our policy
is its not our business
arent we legally obligated

angela we do not want our own arkansas
i think this might
have been sexual assault

based on my
very strong feeling
okay just skip this one
i cant do that i clear my list
