between kimi and products
like siri or alexa 
well  sharon  i will tell you
the difference between kimi and those
other products you mention
by name  people 
it s our people and their level
of excellence that sets us apart 
the voice interpolation on kimi
is a perfect example 
we don t have an algorithm trying to
figure out what you said or what you meant 
we have actual people
analyzing kimi requests
so we can continually update our
understanding of how you communicate 
who you are  what you want 
so you re listening
to everything 
no  not at all  we are flagging miscommunication
so kimi can better understand you 
and we do this every day 
think of it this way  kimi understands
you better today than it did yesterday
because of our people 
is that efficient 
it s actually the fastest way to get
better fast  if that makes any sense 
the bottom line is 
it s working 
you pushed for the amygdala
corporation to go public 
the idea  the timing  mostly yours 
how are you feeling 
i feel great 
i ve been saying since i was
brought in two years ago 
kimi is the future
of this company 
it just seemed obvious to me 
and the board agrees 
but talk to me in a week  after the
ipo  if you ll give me the time 
i absolutely will 
bradley hasling  ceo of the amygdala
corporation  thank you for joining us

delete it 
did you hear me 
i thought it might have been a crime 
yeah  the devices
pick up things  lots of things
