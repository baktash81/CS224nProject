moments so dear
five hundred twentyfive thousand
six hundred minutes
how do you measure
measure a year
in daylights in sunsets
in midnights in cups of coffee
in inches in miles
in laughter in strife
in five hundred twentyfive thousand
six hundred minutes
how do you measure
a year in the life
how about love
how about love
how about love
measure in love
seasons of love
seasons of love
five hundred twentyfive thousand
six hundred minutes
five hundred twentyfive thousand
journeys to plan
five hundred twentyfive thousand
six hundred minutes
how do you measure
the life of a woman or a man
in truths that she learned
or in times that he cried
in bridges he burned
or the way that she died
its time now to sing out
though the story never ends
lets celebrate
remember a year in the life of friends
remember the love
oh you got to
you got to remember the love
you know that love is a gift
from up above
share love give love spread love
measure measure your life in love
seasons of love
seasons of love
measure your life
measure your life in love
december 24th 1989 9 pm
eastern standard time
from here on in
i shoot without a script
see if anything comes of it
instead of my old shit
no get out of here hey
i said get off the window
how do you document real life
when real lifes getting more
like fiction each day
headlines bread lines
blow my mind
and now this deadline
eviction or pay
rent
how do you write a song
when the chords sound wrong
though they once sounded
right and rare
when the notes are sour
where is the power
you once had to ignite the air
were hungry and frozen
some life weve chosen
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
last years rent
last years rent
heiio
hey guess whos back in town
its coiiins man
throw down the key cooi
hey
you got a iight man
yeah
give me that shit
come here man
get that son of a bitch
pick his ass up come on
how do you start a fire
when theres nothing to burn
and it feels like somethings stuck
in your flue
how can you generate heat
when you cant feel your feet
and theyre turning blue
and theyre turning blue
you light up a mean blaze
with posters
and screenplays
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
last years rent
last years rent
how do you stay on your feet
when on every street
its trick or treat
and tonight its trick
welcome back to town
oh i should lie down
everythings brown
and uhoh i feel sick
where is he
getting dizzy
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
last years rent
the music ignites the night
with passionate fire
the narration crackles and pops
with incendiary wit
zoom in as they burn the past
to the ground
and feel the heat
of the futures glow
how do you leave the past behind
when it keeps finding ways
to get to your heart
it reaches way down deep
and tears you inside out
till youre torn apart
rent
how can you connect in an age
where strangers landlords lovers
your own blood cells betray
what binds the fabric together
when the raging shifting winds
of change keep ripping away
draw a line in the sand
and then make a stand
use your camera to spar
use your guitar
when they act tough
you call their bluff
were not gonna pay
were not gonna pay
were not gonna pay
last years rent
this years rent
next years rent
rent rent rent rent rent
were not gonna pay rent
cause everything is rent
hey

find glory
beyond the cheap colored lights
one song
before the sun sets
glory
on another empty life
time flies
time dies
glory
one blaze of glory

find glory
in a song that rings true
truth like a blazing fire
an eternal flame
find one song
a song about love
glory
from the soul of a young man
a young man
find the one song
before the virus takes hold
glory
like a sunset
one song
to redeem this empty life
time flies
and then no need
to endure anymore
time dies

cause her cold eyes can burn
yet you yearn and you churn
and rebound
i think i know what you mean
the tango maureen
the tango maureen
has she ever pouted her lips
and called you pookie
never
have you ever
doubted a kiss or two
this is spooky
did you swoon
when she walked through the door
every time so be cautious
did she moon over other boys
more than moon
im getting nauseous
whered you iearn to tango
with the french ambassadors
daughter in her room at miss porters
and you
with nanette himmeifarb
the rabbis daughter
at the scarsdaie jewish
community center
its hard to do this backwards
you shouid try it in heeis
she cheated
she cheated
maureen cheated
fuckin cheated
im defeated
i should give up right now
gotta look on the bright side
with all of your might
id fall for her still anyhow
when youre dancing her dance
you dont stand a chance
her grip of romance makes you fall
so you think might as well
dance a tango to hell
at least ill have tangoed at all
the tango maureen
gotta dance till your diva is through
you pretend to believe her
cause in the end
you cant leave her
but the end it will come
still you have to play dumb
till youre glum and you bum
and turn blue
why do we love when shes mean
and she can be so obscene

it wasnt cause i didnt
i know
i should tell you
i should tell you
i should tell you i love you
who do you think you are
leaving me alone with my guitar
hold on theres something
you should hear
it isnt much but it took all year
your eyes
as we said our goodbyes
cant get them out of my mind
and i find
i cant hide
from your eyes
the ones that took me by surprise
the night you came into my life
where theres moonlight
i see your eyes
howd i let you slip away
when im longing so to hold you
now id die for one more day
cause theres something
i should have told you
yes theres something
i should have told you
when i looked into your eyes
why does distance make us wise
you were the song all along
and before the song dies
i should tell you
i should tell you
i have always loved you
you can see it in my eyes
mimi
mimi
i was heading
towards this warm
white iight
and i swear
angei was there
and she iooked good
she said
turn around girifriend
and iisten to that boys song
youre drenched
her fevers breaking
there is no future
there is no past
thank god this moments
not the last
theres only us
theres only us
theres only this
theres only this
forget regret
forget regret
or life is yours to miss
no other road
no other way
no day but today
i cant control
will i lose my dignity
my destiny
will someone care
i trust my soul
will i wake tomorrow
my only goal
is just to be
from this nightmare
without you
theres only now
the hand gropes
theres only here
the ear hears
give in to love
the pulse beats
or live in fear
life goes on
no other path
but im gone
no other way
cause i die without you
no day but today
i die without you
no day but today
i die without you
no day but today
i die without you
no day but today
i die without you
