moments so dear
five hundred twenty five thousand
six hundred minutes
how do you measure
measure a year 
in daylights  in sunsets
in midnights  in cups of coffee
in inches  in miles
in laughter  in strife
in five hundred twenty five thousand
six hundred minutes
how do you measure
a year in the life 
how about love 
how about love 
how about love 
measure in love
seasons of love
seasons of love
five hundred twenty five thousand
six hundred minutes
five hundred twenty five thousand
journeys to plan
five hundred twenty five thousand
six hundred minutes
how do you measure
the life of a woman or a man 
in truths that she learned 
or in times that he cried 
in bridges he burned 
 or the way that she died 
 it s time now to sing out
though the story never ends
let s celebrate
remember a year in the life of friends
remember the love
oh  you got to
you got to remember the love
you know that love is a gift
from up above
share love  give love  spread love
measure  measure your life in love
seasons of love
seasons of love
measure your life
measure your life in love
december 24th  1989  9 p m  
eastern standard time 
from here on in 
i shoot without a script 
see if anything comes of it   
   instead of my old shit 
no  get out of here  hey 
i said  get off the window 
how do you document real life
when real life s getting more
like fiction each day 
headlines  bread lines
blow my mind
and now this deadline
eviction or pay
rent
how do you write a song
when the chords sound wrong 
though they once sounded
right and rare
when the notes are sour
where is the power
you once had to ignite the air 
 we re hungry and frozen
 some life we ve chosen
 how we gonna pay 
 how we gonna pay 
 how we gonna pay
 how we gonna pay
 last year s rent 
 last year s rent 
 heiio 
 hey  guess who s back in town 
it s coiiins  man 
throw down the key  cooi 
hey 
 you got a iight  man 
 yeah 
 give me that shit 
 come here  man 
get that son of a bitch 
pick his ass up  come on 
how do you start a fire
when there s nothing to burn
and it feels like something s stuck
in your flue 
how can you generate heat
when you can t feel your feet
 and they re turning blue 
 and they re turning blue 
you light up a mean blaze
 with posters
 and screenplays
 how we gonna pay 
 how we gonna pay 
 how we gonna pay 
 how we gonna pay 
 how we gonna pay
 how we gonna pay
 last year s rent 
 last year s rent 
how do you stay on your feet
when on every street
it s trick or treat
and tonight it s trick 
welcome back to town
oh  i should lie down
everything s brown
and  uh oh  i feel sick
 where is he 
 getting dizzy
 how we gonna pay 
 how we gonna pay 
how we gonna pay 
how we gonna pay
last year s rent 
the music ignites the night
with passionate fire
the narration crackles and pops
with incendiary wit
zoom in as they burn the past
to the ground
and feel the heat
of the future s glow
how do you leave the past behind
when it keeps finding ways
to get to your heart 
it reaches way down deep
and tears you inside out
till you re torn apart
rent
how can you connect in an age
where strangers  landlords  lovers
your own blood cells betray 
what binds the fabric together
when the raging  shifting winds
of change keep ripping away 
draw a line in the sand
and then make a stand
 use your camera to spar
 use your guitar
when they act tough
you call their bluff
we re not gonna pay
we re not gonna pay
we re not gonna pay
last year s rent
this year s rent
next year s rent
rent  rent  rent  rent  rent
we re not gonna pay rent
 cause everything is rent

i handle this quietly
you can t quietiy wipe out
an entire tent city   
   then watch it s a wonderful life

and write songs 
you need somewhere to do it
it s what we used to dream about
think twice before you pooh pooh it

glory
one song before i go
glory
one song to leave behind
find one song
one last refrain
glory
from the pretty boy front man
who wasted opportunity
one song
he had the world at his feet
glory
in the eyes of a young girl
a young girl
find glory
beyond the cheap colored lights
one song
before the sun sets
glory
on another empty life
time flies
time dies
glory
one blaze of glory
one blaze of glory
glory
find glory
in a song that rings true
truth like a blazing fire
an eternal flame
find one song
a song about love
glory
from the soul of a young man
a young man
find the one song
before the virus takes hold
glory
like a sunset
one song
to redeem this empty life
time flies
and then no need
to endure anymore
time dies

 this is weird
 it s weird
 very weird
 fuckin  weird
i m so mad that
i don t know what to do
fighting with microphones
freezing down to my bones
and to top it all off
i m with you
feel like going insane 
got a fire in your brain 
and you re thinking
of drinking gasoline 
 as a matter of fact
 honey  i know this act
it s called the tango  maureen
the tango  maureen
it s a dark  dizzy merry go round
 as she keeps you dangling
 you re wrong
 your heart she is mangling
 it s different with me
and you toss and you turn
 cause her cold eyes can burn
yet you yearn  and you churn
and rebound
i think i know what you mean
 the tango  maureen
 the tango  maureen
has she ever pouted her lips
and called you   pookie   
never 
have you ever
doubted a kiss or two 
this is spooky
did you swoon
when she walked through the door 
every time  so be cautious
did she moon over other boys 
 more than moon
 i m getting nauseous
where d you iearn to tango 
with the french ambassador s
daughter in her room at miss porter s 
and you 
with nanette himmeifarb 
the rabbi s daughter   
   at the scarsdaie jewish
community center 
it s hard to do this backwards 
you shouid try it in heeis 
 she cheated
 she cheated
 maureen cheated
 fuckin  cheated
i m defeated
i should give up right now
gotta look on the bright side
with all of your might
i d fall for her still  anyhow
when you re dancing her dance
you don t stand a chance
her grip of romance makes you fall
 so you think    might as well  
   dance a tango to hell  
  at least i ll have tangoed at all  
the tango  maureen
gotta dance till your diva is through
you pretend to believe her
 cause in the end
you can t leave her
but the end  it will come
still you have to play dumb
till you re glum and you bum
and turn blue
why do we love when she s mean 
and she can be so obscene

 only blue
 lonely blue
 lonely blue
within me  blue
without you
without you
the hand gropes
the ear hears
the pulse beats
without you
the eyes gaze
the legs walk
the lungs breathe
 the mind churns
 the mind churns
 the heart yearns
 the heart yearns
 the tears dry
 the tears dry
without you
 life goes on
 life goes on
 but i m gone
 but i m gone
  cause i die without you
 i die
without you
without you
 without you
 without you
it s right   
   that today s haiioween 
it was angei s favorite hoiiday 
i knew we d hit it off
the moment we met 
there was this skinhead
that was harassing her   
   and she just waiked
right up to him and said 
  i m more of a man
than you ii ever be   
   and more of a woman
than you ii ever get   
and then there was this time   
   he waiked up
to this group of tourists   
   and they were petrified   
   because  a  they were
obviousiy iost   
   and  b  had probabiy never spoken
to a drag queen before in their iives 
and he    
she   
   just offered to escort them
out of aiphabet city   
   and then iet them
take a picture with her   
   and then said she d heip them
find the circie line 
so much more originai
than any of us 
you d find an oid tabiecioth
on the street and make a dress   
   and then the next year 
sure enough   
   they d be mass producing
them at the gap 
you aiways said how iucky
you were that we were aii friends   
   but it was us  baby   
   who were the iucky ones

you ll never share real love
until you love yourself

i can t believe this family must die

dive into work
drive the other way
that drip of hurt
that pint of shame
goes away
just play the game

thank god this moment s
not the last
 there s only us

 there s only this
 there s only this
 forget regret
 forget regret
or life is yours to miss
no other road
no other way
no day but today
 i can t control
 will i lose my dignity 
 my destiny
 will someone care 
 i trust my soul
 will i wake tomorrow
my only goal
 is just to be
 from this nightmare 
 without you
 there s only now
 the hand gropes
 there s only here
 the ear hears
 give in to love
 the pulse beats
 or live in fear
 life goes on
 no other path
 but i m gone
 no other way
  cause i die without you
 no day but today
 i die without you
 no day but today
 i die without you
 no day but today
 i die without you
 no day but today
 i die without you
