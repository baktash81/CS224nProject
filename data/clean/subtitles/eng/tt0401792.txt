she only goes stiff for a moment 
care for a smoke 
sure 
i ll take one 
are you as bored by that crowd as i am 
i didn t come here for the party 
i came here for you 
i ve watched you for days 
you re everything a man could ever want 
it s not just your face 
your figure  or your voice 
it s your eyes 
all the things i see in your eyes 
what is it you see in my eyes 
i see a crazy calm 
you re sick of running 
you re ready to face what you have to face 
but you don t want to face it alone 
no 
i don t want to face it alone 
the wind rises electric 
she s soft and warm
and almost weightless 
her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes 
i tell her that everything will be all right 
that i ll save her from whatever
she s scared of and take her far  far away 
i tell her i love her 
the silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot 
i hold her close until she s gone 
i ll never know
what she was running from 
i ll cash her check in the morning 
just one hour to go 
my last day on the job 
early retirement 
not my idea 
doctor s orders 
heart condition 
 angina   he calls it 
i m polishing my badge and getting myself
used to the idea of saying goodbye to it 
it  and the 30 odd years
of protecting and serving and tears
and the blood and terror
and triumph it represents 
i m thinking about eileen s slow smile 
about the thick  fat steaks
she picked up at the butcher s today 
and i m thinking about
the one loose end i haven t tied up 
a young girl who s out there somewhere 
helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic 
damn it  hartigan  i won t let you do this 
you re gonna get yourself killed 
you re gonna get us both killed 
i won t let you  i m warnin  you 
let go of my coat  bob

they can kill me  too 
i ain t puttin  up with that  i m gettin 
on the horn and calling for backup 
sure  bob 
we ll just wait 
sit on our hands while that roark brat gets
his sick thrills with victim number four 
victim number four 
nancy callahan  age 11 
and she ll be raped
and slashed to ribbons 
and that backup that we re waitin  on
will just so happen to show up
just late enough for roark
to get back to his us senator daddy 
take a deep breath  hartigan 
settle down and think straight 
you re pushin  60
and you got a bum ticker 
you ain t savin  anyone 
you got a great attitude  bob

taking you home really soon 
but first 
we re going to introduce you to somebody 
he s a very nice man 
halfway to the warehouse where
weevil said they took her  and it hits 
icked spot of indigestion 
at least that s what i pray it is 
   lighthearted
and momentary digression 
the briefest indulge ment
in automotive pleasure 
for cheap thrills 
such short lived durability  mr  shlubb 
you would risk engender ating ill will
on the part of our employers 
burt shlubb and douglas klump  
two any dirty job there is thugs
with delusions of eloquence 
this jaguar you so pinheadedly covet  
temporarily remanded
to our custody though it may be  
remains the property
of the son of senator roark 
gotta keep this quiet 
take  em down fast 
a single dent 
the merest scratch thereupon 
and the before mentioned consequences
of which i so recently made mention

catch your breath

but it won t slow down 
get over it 
she needs you

but you ve got nothing to be scared of 
all we re gonna do is have a nice little talk 
that s all  just a nice talk 
just you and me

he likes to hear  em scream 
i ve seen his victims
and their twisted little faces 
all wide mouthed and bug eyed  frozen
in their last horrible moment of living 
no screams 
either i m just in time  or i m way too late 
it s nothing  barely a flesh wound 
on your feet  old man 
roark

skinny little nancy

once the backup gets here 
run home  nancy

don t listen to him 
he s a crazy man 
  what a tough man you are 
  you stay right where you re at 
you shoot your partner in the back   
then you try to scare a little girl 
maybe i ll pull my spare rod  plug you
a couple of times  show you how it s done 
we could ve worked something out 
but you ve blown that 
sit down or i ll blast you in half 
  you re so slow  you ll never stop me 
  sit down 
you ll never be able to stop me 
i finally sit down 
just like you told me to 
the sirens are close now 
she ll be safe 
things go dark 
i don t mind much 
getting sleepy 
it s ok 
she ll be safe 
an old man dies 
a little girl lives 
fair trade 
the night is hot as hell 
it s a lousy room
in a lousy part of a lousy town 
i m staring at a goddess 
she s telling me she wants me 
i m not gonna waste one more second
wondering how i ve gotten so lucky 
i want you 
she smells like angels ought to smell 
the perfect woman 
the goddess 
i need you 
goldie 
she says her name is goldie 
three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big 
and that cold thing
happens to my stomach 
and i realize goldie s dead 
not a mark on her 
you d have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers
aren t moving like they would
if she was breathing 
she was murdered
and i was right here when it happened 
lying next to her 
stone drunk  just like she was 
damn it  goldie  who were you
and who wanted you dead 
who were you
besides an angel of mercy 
giving a two time loser like me
the night of his life 
it sure as hell wasn t my looks 
so why the sleazy saloon 
why the kindness  goldie 
the cops   they re telling me too much 
showing up before anybody
but me and the killer
could know there s been a murder 
somebody paid good money
for this frame 
no reason at all to play it quiet 
no reason to play it any way but my way 
whoever killed you is gonna pay  goldie 
open up  police 
i ll be right out 
i don t know why you died  goldie 
i don t know why and i don t know how
i never even met you before tonight 
but you were a friend and more
when i needed one 
and when i find out who did it 
it won t be quick and quiet
like it was with you 
it ll be loud and nasty   my kind of kill 
and when his eyes go dead 
the hell i send him to
will seem like heaven
after what i ve done to him 
i love you  goldie 
claire 
now  don t worry  lucille 
i was just grazed 
  you got any beers around this place 
  no way am i giving you any alcohol 
besides  it s not what
you came here for anyway  is it 
no 
go ahead 
you re worse without  em 
thanks 
you re the best 
lucille s my parole officer 
she s a dyke  but god knows why 
its that body of hers
she could have any man she wants 
the pills come from a girlfriend
who s a shrink 
she tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared 
haven t seen you like this in a while 
  got in a fight with some cops 
  didn t happen to kill any of them  did ya 
not that i know of  but they know they ve
been in a fight  that s for damn sure 
how the hell do you suppose
i m gonna square this with the board 
there ain t no squaring it 
not this time 
this isn t some barroom brawl 
or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone 
hey  hey 
this is big 
  settle down  marv  take another pill 
  hey  there ain t no settlin  down 
this is blood for blood  and by the gallons 
this is the old days and the bad days 
the all or nothing days 
they re back 
there s no choices left 
and i m ready for war 
prison was hell for you  marv 
it s gonna be life this time 
hell s waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you re here 
but i m out now 
it took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it 
but i m out 
i know exactly what i gotta do 
so you were scared 
weren t you  goldie 
somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it 
so you hit the saloons  the bad places 
looking for the biggest 
meanest lug around and finding me 
well  i m gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you 
and i m gonna give him the hard goodbye 
walk down
the right back alley in sin city   
  leave your hands off nancy 
    and you could find anything 
that coat looks like baghdad 
so does your face 
take off 
he s new here  marv 
he didn t know 
kadie s is my kind of joint 
nancy s just getting started with her gig 
but already the crowd s breathing hard 
plenty of nights i ve drooled over nancy 
shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me 
but that s not what i m lookin  for tonight 
what ll it be  marv 
a shot and a brew  shellie 
and keep  em comin  
sure  honey 
you take it slow  now 
most people think marv is crazy 
he just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century 
he d be right at home
on some ancient battlefield 
swinging an ax into somebody s face 
or in a roman arena
taking a sword to other gladiators like him 
they d have tossed him girls
like nancy back then 
show s over  dickwad 
drink up 
now  that s one fine looking coat
you re wearing there 
your killin  days are over 
you over the hill  do gooder son of a bitch 
i love hit men  no matter what
you do to them  you don t feel bad 
  take it off 
  what 
a fine coat like that 
and you re bleeding all over it 
all right  it s all yours 
oh  god 
it wasn t you losers who killed goldie 
the guy who did that 
he knew what he was doing 
so tell me  man 
who sent you 
i don t hear you giving me any names 
so i guess when i shot you in the belly
i aimed a little too high 
you keep holding out on me like this 
and i m gonna have to get really nasty 
it was telly   
telly stern passed me the order 
he runs the tables over
to the triple ace club 
thanks again 
then the damnedest thing happens 
for a second  i smell the angel smell
that belonged to my goldie 
just need my medicine  is all 
bastard 
you re gonna pay for what you did to me 
feel like talking  louie 
how many got paid off
for the frame  louie  huh 
how many for the kill 
it was connelly 
he set me up 
he ll never talk 
i don t know about you 
but i m havin  a ball 
connelly talks 
they all talk 
and what have been
your sins  my son 
well  padre 
i don t want to keep you up all night 
so i ll just fill you in on the latest batch 
these here hands of mine 
they got blood all over  em 
you re speaking figuratively 
when i need to find something out 
i just go out and look for somebody
that knows more than me 
and i go and i ask them 
sometimes  i ask pretty hard 
by way of a  for instance  
i killed three men tonight 
tortured  em first 
you might say i been
working my way up the food chain 
first two were minnows  
small time messengers 
but it was connelly  the money man 
who fingered you  padre 
dear lord  man 
this is a house of god 
just give me a damn name 
  roark 
  you really are pushing your luck  padre 
feeding me garbage like that 
it can t be that big 
there s a farm
at north cross and lennox 
it s all there 
find out for yourself 
and while you re at it 
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for 
worth dying for 
worth killing for 
worth going to hell for 
amen 
his keys say the padre drove a mercedes 
or at least that s what they re
passing off as a mercedes these days 
modern cars  
they all look like electric shavers 
goldie 
goldie 
it couldn t be goldie 
it s my own fault  and nobody else s 
that i got confused 
i ve been having so much fun
i forgot to take my medicine 
that wasn t goldie back there 
goldie s dead 
and that s the whole reason
that i ve been doing what i ve been doing 
when you got a condition 
it s bad to forget your medicine 
the cold thing  it creeps into my gut
and tells me one more time it won t let go 
this is a bad place  this farm 
people have died here   
   the wrong way 
i don t want to fight  pooch 
i got no gripe with you 
easy  boy 
no way i was gonna use
my gun on you  buddy 
it s whoever owns you i m curious about 
because there s blood on your breath 
and i think i know what kind 
so i sniff around to see what s buried 
here we go 
it s impossible 
nobody can sneak up on me 
i go blind 
not a sound  nobody s that quiet 
nobody except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago 
it was you  you bastard 
you killed her 
you killed goldie 
it was   
i blew it  goldie 
i found your killer 
but he was better than me 
too quiet  too quick 
a killer born 
why didn t he finish the job 
he keeps the heads 
he eats the rest 
  lucille 
  it s not just that wolf of his 
the wolf just gets scraps 
bones 
it s him 
he eats people 
  he cooks them like they were steaks 
  let s get you warm 
just like they were steaks 
now he s got both of us 
it s all right 
take a nice  slow breath 
just look at the heads on the wall 
the heads on the wall 
the heads on the wall 
son of a bitch 
he kept smiling that damned smile 
he made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers 
  he made me watch 
  oh  jesus 
he made me watch 
christ  i could use a cigarette 
dames 
sometimes all they gotta do is let it out 
and a few buckets later 
there s no way you d know 
you ve brought us
some big trouble this time  marv 
whoever s behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department 
any leads 
one guy i talked to told me
it was roark running the show 
whoever it is  he knew i was checking out
that hooker almost before i did 
  what hooker 
  the one you ve been obsessing over 
the dead one 
goldie 
i didn t know she was a hooker 
doesn t make any difference
about anything 
  but i didn t know that 
  she was high class stuff 
she must have shown you quite a time 
quiet 
there s a car coming 
kevin 
all i ve got is a face    and a name 
i ll see you later  kevin 
let s go 
they re done checking the house 
they re coming this way 
bastards 
i ll show them 
you re not gonna get
either of us killed  marv 
no  don t shoot 
please 
listen to me 
i m his parole officer 
he s unconscious and unarmed 
so there s no need to kill him 
captain  the target   there s no sign of him 
here s a sign 
that there is one
damn fine coat you re wearing 
i keep coming back to that cop i just killed
and what he told me 
i was pretty steamed about
what he d done to lucille 
so i took my time
with that son of a bitch 
it wasn t till i showed him
all those pieces of himself that he said it 
just a name
patrick henry roark  man of the cloth 
could ve become president 
but he chose to serve god 
along the way  he happened to become
the most powerful man in the state 
he s brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing 
he even made his rotten brother
a us senator without breaking a sweat 
and here he s gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker 
i m getting used to the idea 
more and more  i m liking the sound of it 
then it hits me like a kick in the nuts 
what if i m wrong 
i ve got a condition 
i get confused sometimes 
and with lucille dead 
i can t get my medicine 
what if i ve imagined all of this 
what if i ve finally turned into what
they ve always said i was gonna turn into 
a maniac 
a psycho killer 
can t kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to 
i ve gotta know for sure 
the merchandise is on display
by the time i make my way to old town 
for an hour or so 
i asked around about goldie 
i don t get any answers 
but i know i m bound to 
lucille said goldie was a hooker 
and if she was  she has roots here
friends  maybe even family 
you can t be goldie 
goldie s dead 
goldie 
yeah  sure  right 
i haven t eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now 
no wonder i m seeing things 
bastard 
he s crazy 
hit him again  wendy 
harder 
wait a minute 
why did she call you wendy 
because that s my name  you ape 
goldie was my sister 
my twin sister 
i guess she was the nice one 
goldie and the other six   where are they 
what did you do to them 
you crazy goddamn broad 
just take a look at this mug 
would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you 
none of you would  but goldie 
and she only did because
she thought i could protect her 
and i ll bet those cops didn t do a damn
thing about those other girls  did they 
but as soon as they had me for a fall guy 
they showed up  guns blazing 
but they didn t get me  and i ve been killing
my way to the truth ever since 
so  go ahead  doll 
shoot me now 
or get the hell out of my way 
nuts 
ok  i m glad we got all that sorted out 
  what the hell 
  i tied those knots  that s my specialty 
you sat there and took it 
when you could ve taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to 
well  sure  i thought i might be able
to talk some sense into you 
and i probably would have had
to paste you one 
and i don t hurt girls 
i need a pair of handcuffs 
what style do you want 
i got a collection 
just give him the ones
you got with you  gail 
it was a farm boy named kevin
who killed goldie 
but it was cardinal roark
who was behind it  and i don t know why 
i know that sounds crazy 
no  it doesn t 
goldie worked the clergy 
just like that  a whopper of a puzzle piece
falls smack in my lap 
i m too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet 
but she fires up two cigarettes and hands
me one  and i taste her lipstick on it 
and suddenly  my heart s pounding
so loud i can t hear anything else 
i want to reach over and touch her
and taste goldie s sweat one more time 
but she isn t goldie 
yeah  yeah 
this ll do 
i m also gonna be needing a dozen
two foot lengths of this rubber tubing   
and a spool of razor wire   
and a pair of those special gloves
that ll let me handle the wire 
beefing up
the old home security  huh 
you can bet your ass 
she was my sister 
so i m in this one to the end 
but why are you willing to go up against
roark for someone you barely knew 
she was nice to me  gave me
something i didn t even know existed 
i wasn t never even able to buy a woman 
you know  the way i look 
i take my mind off her
and i crawl back inside myself 
it s almost killing time 
and i d better get sharp 
i check the list
rubber tubing  gas  saw 
gloves  cuffs  razor wire  hatchet 
gladys and my mitts 
  we re close enough  pull over 
  yes  marv 
keep the engine runnin  
if i m not back in 20 minutes  you get
the hell outta here and don t look back 
kill him for me  marv 
kill him good 
i won t let you down  goldie 
heading downstairs to the kitchen 
getting himself a midnight snack 
and i can guess what kind 
come on  you son of a bitch 
damn  he s slick 
is that the best you can do  creep 
that s right 
get personal  get close  i can take it 
i got you  you little bastard 
let s see you hop around now 
i try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs 
my muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come 
let me do it  marv 
she was my sister  let me finish him 
you wasn t supposed
to come down here  wendy 
oh  but i want to   
i m sorry  kid 
but i haven t even started with this creep 
and i don t want you watching the rest 
it ll give you nightmares 
god  i gotta tell you  i m good and bushed 
and it s not that fight of ours
that did me in  either 
it s all that sawing and tying 
it s not as easy as it looks 
could have been a real mess around here
if i didn t have that tubing for tourniquets 
i gotta admit 
there was a spurt or two 
to get the scent in the air 
to get that friend of yours to come running 
well  what do you know 
look who s here 
here he comes 
that s a good dog 
he doesn t scream 
not even when the mutt s had its fill
and kevin s guts
are lying all over the place 
somehow the bastard is still alive 
still staring at me 
not even when i grab the saw
and finish the job 
he never screams 
i put in a call to kadie s
and ask nancy to get her clothes on
and meet me at her place 
she says   yes   like always 
hey  nancy  you got any beers 
sure  marv 
who s the babe 
there isn t much of anything
nancy wouldn t do for me 
not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up
and i straightened him out but good 
it really gets my goat
when guys rough up dames 
so  what do you want me to do with her 
well  your best bet is
drive her all the way up to sacred oaks 
what about you 
are you leaving town 
hell  no 
i like it here 
i hot wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit
so as not to get any attention 
my head starts to clear 
things start to make sense 
i owe you  goldie 
i owe you one and i m gonna pay up 
so  if going after roark
means dying  win or lose  
hell  i ll die laughing
if i know i ve done this one thing right 
quiet as a grave out here 
no sign of target 
all right  keep a lookout 
  kevin 
  what s left of him  anyways 
the dog ate the rest 
oh  my god 
you monster 
you demon 
don t scream or i ll plug you 
he had the voice of an angel 
yet he spoke only to me 
and he s dead now
because of one stupid whore 
it s not a real good idea for you to talk
about goldie that way while i m around 
when he came to me   
he was a tormented boy 
tormented by guilt 
i tried to counsel him 
but the eating   it filled him with white light 
tearful  he swore to me
that he felt the touch of god almighty 
what the hell do you know 
i know it s pretty damn weird to eat people 
he didn t just eat their bodies 
he ate their souls 
and i joined in 
they were all whores 
nobody cared for them 
nobody missed them 
and then your goldie
almost ruined everything 
she stayed in public places 
and then with you 
you were so convenient 
you d broke a man s jaw that very night 
who would believe a thug like you 
kevin killed her 
i ordered the police in for you 
but you wouldn t be caught 
you wouldn t stop 
and now he s dead and you re here to   
eliminate me 
will that give you satisfaction  my son 
killing a helpless old fart 
the killing  no 
no satisfaction 
everything up until the killing will be a gas 
kevin   
we re going home 
you can scream now if you want to 
it s beautiful  goldie 
it s just like i promised  only better 
and when his eyes go dead 
the hell i sent him to must seem like
heaven after what i ve done to him 
  freeze 
  oh  my god 
jerks 
they should ve shot me in the head 
and enough times to make sure 
it s so stupid 
everybody knows what s coming 
but they go through the motions anyway 
what a waste of time 
months fall off the calendar
while i breathe and eat through tubes 
night after night  i wait for somebody
to come and finish me off 
after a while 
i realize it s not gonna be so easy as that 
i m on my feet for about ten minutes
before the cops kick them out
from under me 
they don t ask me any questions 
they just keep knocking the crap out of
me and waving a confession in my face 
and i keep spitting blood all over it
and laughing at how many fresh copies
they come up with 
then along comes this worm assistant
district attorney who turns the recorder off
and says if i don t sign their confession 
they ll kill my mom 
i break his arm in three places
and i sign it 
from then on 
it s the circus everybody wants it to be 
they nail me for the works  
not just the people i did kill 
but even lucille and the girls
that roark and kevin ate 
and even goldie 
the judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence 
midnight and my death
are only a few hours away 
when i get my first surprise in 18 months 
my only visitor 
i m ready for anything but that scent 
i got  em for you good 
didn t i  goldie 
oh  i m sorry  wendy 
i got confused again 
just seeing you like this 
you can call me goldie 
she smells like angels ought to smell 
the perfect woman 
the goddess 
goldie 
she says her name is goldie 
they fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal 
they even throw in a brew 
it s the first i ve had since back at nancy s 
then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it 
and it s about damned time 
if you ask me 
 yea  though i walk through the valley
of the shadow of death     
would you get a move on 
i haven t got all night 
you heard the man 
hit it 
is that the best you can do  you pansies 
he s gone 
forget it  man 
you can bang on that door
all night if you want to 
there is no way in hell i m letting you in 
i can t believe
you re doing this to me  shellie 
everything we ve shared  
it has to mean something to you 
ha  it meant plenty 
plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to flirt with a waitress
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises 
i know you re angry  baby 
and i forgive you for that
without you even asking me to 
there s a difference
between getting honked off
at a guy who s generally not so bad 
and finding out that you ve been
sweet talked by a total jerk loser
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn t even tell you about
every time he gets drunk 
which is way too often 
especially the kind of total jerk loser
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man 
that hurt  shellie 
it s one thing for you to play hard to get 
but don t go trying to cut my nuts off 
i am impossible to get 
do yourself a favor  jackie boy 
and get help  like a shrink 
get help and get lost 
just open the door 
go ahead and open the door  shellie 
i ll take care of this 
just open the door and you ll see
how wrong you ve been about me 
oblige him  shellie 
i m ready for him 
no  if he knew that you were here with me 
you don t know how bad this could get 
this clown s got a big  mean drunk on 
and he s got four friends
out there in the hall 
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is 
hey  i could swear i heard somebody
in there with you just now 
somebody  jackie boy 
it s a regular african love fest in here 
  i m no racist 
  i mean  i got me all five starters 
and half the bench of
the basin city blues keeping me company 
you feel like taking them on 
you are teasing me  baby 
some of my best friends   
but you re really pushing my buttons 
and the whole time
you ve been doing me like this 
i ve been too polite to point out
that at any time i want to 
i could kick this damn door to splinters 
ok  baby  you know what i can do 
  you know what i can do  one  two   
  all right  then

troops  make yourself at home

none of these bozos got lives 
they gotta hang out with you 
you re gonna love this  baby 
you re gonna call up some of your friends
who work the saloon 
with you and the bunch of us 
we re gonna hit every joint in town 
and it s gonna be great 
i ain t calling up nobody 
that s a man s shirt 
and i m sure as hell it ain t one of mine 
you got somebody s love stink all over you 
you ve been with another man
and you ve been with him tonight 
  who is he 
  he s superman 
he flew out the window
just as soon as he heard you were coming 
 cause you scared him so bad 
you think
i have no feelings at all 
if you re gonna slug me 
just go ahead and get it over with 
you sick bastard 
there you go 
lying about me again 
right in front of my friends 
i have never hit a woman in my life 
that s showing her  man 
you goddamn bastard 
you goddamn coward 
baby  we re all here to have a good time 
i gotta take a leak 
wish you d dropped by earlier  jackie boy 
then you could ve met my boyfriend 
could ve seen what a real man looks like 
there you go  after my nuts again 
but i forgive you 
i m a generous guy 
he is generous 
but that temper of his   
you never should have
picked on him like you did 
my temper you don t have to worry about 
shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or i ll cut your little pecker off 
i ve been told 
hey  baby 
i don t hear you making those calls 
answer me 
i don t need this grief 
hi  i m shellie s new boyfriend
and i m out of my mind 
you ever so much as talk to shellie again 
you even think her name 
and i ll cut you in ways
that ll make you useless to a woman 
you re making a big mistake  man 
a big mistake 
yeah 
you already made a big mistake yourself 
you didn t flush 
troops  get outta here 
no questions  damn it 
no questions 
now 
dwight  what in the devil
did you do to him 
i just gave him a taste of his own medicine 
i don t think he ll be bothering you again 
  how s your jaw 
  i ve been slapped around worse 
dwight  he was from a while back 
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours 
and it was only  cause i felt sorry for him 
and it was only once 
i ve done some dumb things 
seeing as how
i m one of those dumb things 
i can t give you
too hard a time about that  shellie 
but this guy  he s a menace 
he might kill somebody if i don t stop him 
i ll call you later 
no  don t go 
shellie shouts something
i can t quite make out
over the racket of a passing police  copter 
  stop 
  it sounds like  stop   but i can t be sure 
it s a chance i shouldn t be taking 
but i can t just go home and forget about it 
and let jackie boy and his pals
find their fun 
they re a pack of predators and they re
out for blood tonight   a woman s blood 
damn it  dwight 
damn it 
you fool 
you damned fool 
i cut my caddy across the park
to pick up jackie boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill 
i m speeding 
that s a good way to get yourself noticed 
and if you re a murderer with a new face
who s one fingerprint check away from
the fast track to the gas chamber like i am 
the last thing you want
is to get noticed 
i don t have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop  and even if i did 
there s always the outside chance
he s one of the honest ones 
do i try to talk my way out of this 
or do i take this cop down and risk it all 
then jackie boy saves me
a great  big  steaming pile of trouble 
watch it  jack 
cops 
they re right on our ass 
not for long 
not where we re headed 
my gut tightens up 
jackie boy s leading us
straight to old town 
the cop shuts off his siren 
he knows he s not the law 
not in old town 
the ladies are the law here 
beautiful and merciless 
if you ve got the cash
and you play by the rules 
they ll make all your dreams come true 
but if you cross  em  you re a corpse 
hey  baby 
hop in  sugar 
we ll get you there 
sweetheart  i work the day shift
and it s been a long day 
besides  i don t do group jobs 
get in the car  baby 
we ll just talk  it ll be nice 
i don t do talk jobs  either 
babydoll 
i ve had me one hell of a bad day 
i ve been beat up every time i turn around 
but the day i get turned down by a hooker
when i got good 
hard earned cash to pay her with   
well   
there s only so much a man can take 
go try the alamo over on dillon street 
that s the alamo  not the amigo 
the amigo s a fag joint 
are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all 
that s far enough  dwight 
we ve been on top of these peckerwoods
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them 
everything s under control 
enjoy the show 
there s no use arguing with her 
the ladies are their own enforcers 
so  how s the barmaid 
you know  the one that never shuts up 
not right now  gail 
wound up a little tight  aren t we 
that s your whole problem  dwight 
you worry too much 
that  and your lousy taste in women 
these days  anyway 
damn it  gail 
not right now 
those clowns down the way  
they some of the barmaid s boyfriends 
one of them thinks he is 
he s outta control 
i followed them here to make sure
he didn t hurt any of the girls 
us helpless little girls 
all kinds of death is about to hit
less than 20 yards ahead of us 
and still it s hard to take my eyes off her 
us girls are safe as we can be  lancelot 
those boys in that chrysler
are one mistake away
from seeing what miho can do 
and she s been aching for some practice 
she guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roof s edge 
  deadly little miho 
  you re running out of alley  cowboy 
turn around  save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief 
you re a sassy little thing 
you ain t hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats 
the trap is set 
locked and ready to spring 
so what  they re scum 
they deserve what s coming 
so why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong 
they haven t killed anybody i know about 
it got pretty bad at shellie s place 
but they didn t kill anybody 
and they won t 
why this rotten feeling 
something shellie said 
i can t place it 
ok  ok  ok  i sounded off
a little more than i should have 
  i m a little on edge 
  over the edge 
it s not a woman you need 
it s a good night s sleep 
you couldn t handle a woman 
the state you re in 
she s saying you ain t got
what it takes  jack 
you wanna see it 
you wanna see what i got 
i ve seen all shapes  all sizes 
you seen this one 
get in the car 
oh  sugar  you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life 
oh  god  no 
this is crazy 
out of nowhere  for no reason at all 
go ahead 
  he s got the drop on her 
  he s got squat 
he s dead 
he s just too damn dumb to know it 
i got you right where i want you 
this is a career ending wound  whore 
  and there s gonna be hell to pay 
  watch your step  jackie boy 
this isn t funny 
don t anyone laugh 
i got friends you can t imagine 
every one of you is gonna burn 
hang it up 
she s just playing with you 
  you re only making it worse 
  you shut the hell up 
don t pull the trigger 
she blocked the barrel  it ll backfire 
i told you to shut up 
i can t see 
what s happening 
i can t see 
i can t hear anything 
for god s sake  miho  finish him 
make it quick  will you 
she doesn t quite chop his head off 
she makes a pez dispenser out of him 
then it s straight to business   stretching
the corpses out on the alley floor
and going through their pockets 
divvying up cash when they find it 
i m fishing around in jackie boy s pants 
his wallet is packed 
mastercard  discover 
platinum american express 
and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties
that i m not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets 
then i find an atom bomb 
jackie boy 
you son of a bitch 
there was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket 
i couldn t quite make out what she said 
i thought shellie said  stop   
she said  cop   
detective lieutenant jack rafferty 
iron jack  the papers call him 
a goddamn hero cop 
it s held for years  the shaky truce 
the cops get a slice of the profits and free
entertainment when they throw a party 
the girls get to administer
their own brand of justice 
they get to defend their own turf 
if a cop blunders into the neighborhood
and he s not shopping for what the girls
are selling  they send him packing 
but they send him back alive 
that s the rules 
that s the truce 
the cops stay out 
that keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out 
old town will be left wide open 
it ll be war 
the streets will run red with blood  
women s blood 
the cops 
the mob 
things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be 
the hell they will 
we got guns 
we ll fight the cops and the mob
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us 
  we ll go to war 
  don t be stupid 
you wouldn t stand a chance 
get me a car 
make sure it s a hardtop
with a decent engine 
i ll hide the bodies 
did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here 
the cops know rafferty came here 
they ll check the river 
they ll check the sewer 
they ll find him
and come gunning for us 
i ll haul the bodies to the pits 
the cops won t check the pits 
get that gun out of my face or i ll smack ya 
who do you think you are  giving orders 
  you got what you wanted out of us 
  shut up  gail 
you got what you wanted out of me 
and you were gone 
off playing with that barmaid 
gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us 
miho moves to my back 
one word from gail
and she ll cut me in half 
they ll be watching the roads 
they ll catch you 
it ll be the bad old days all over again 
the pimps  the beatings 
the drugs  the rapes 
they won t be watching the roads  not yet 
they won t  get me a damn hardtop 
if i don t make it  you can have your war 
get that gun out of my face now 
bastard 
i forgot how quick you are 
my warrior woman 
she almost yanks my head clean off 
shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts 
an explosion that blasts away
the dull  gray years
between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine 
a hardtop with a decent engine 
and make sure it s got a big trunk 
i ll always love you  baby 
always    and never 
where d you find that heap 
just look at that trunk 
we ll never fit  em all in 
gail  unless there s something else
you want me to do 
you think maybe i could go home 
all this blood and stuff s got me kind of
feeling like maybe i m gonna hurl 
sure  becky  go home 
but don t you talk to anybody 
not even your mom 
they ll never fit in that trunk 
not like this  they won t 
miho 
dry your hair as soon as you get home 
you ll catch cold if you don t 
hey  becky 
gail said no calls 
i just want to hear my mom s voice 
i won t tell her nothing 
please  don t say nothing to gail 
hey  mom 
dizzy dames 
what were they thinking  sticking me
with a beat up bucket of bolts like this 
we were barely able to get the trunk
to stay closed as it was 
we packed it so tight 
there wasn t anything we could do
but pile jackie boy in right next to me 
out where anybody who cares to look
will see him 
go ahead  take one of his cigarettes 
it ll help 
it s got you smoking there  bud 
you shut the hell up  jackie boy 
you re dead 
i m just imagining this  so shut the hell up 
well  it tells you something
about your state of mind  don t it 
it s got you hearing things 
it s got your nerves shot 
it s got you smoking 
you know it s true 
nobody ever really quits 
a smoker s a smoker
when the chips are down 
  and your chips are down 
  i m fine  you shut the hell up 
will you look at that 
those hookers let you down 
what are you gonna do
when you run outta gas  call aaa 
you sucker for the babes  you 
you ain t even gonna make it to the pits 
you shut the hell up 
i ll make it 
not unless you keep
your eyes on the road  sugar pie 
watch it 
this is great 
just like being in a buddy movie 
shut up 
boy  you re screwed 
it s over 
you re flushed 
this time  i can t bring myself
to tell him to shut up 
sure  he s an asshole 
sure  he s dead 
sure  i m just imagining that he s talking 
none of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right 
i don t have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop 
not in this heap 
pull over 
the only question left
is whether i m gonna kill him or not 
tough call 
for all i know 
he s an honest cop  regular guy 
a working stiff with a mortgage 
a wife and a pile of kids 
my hand moves all on its own 
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer 
  i don t know what to do 
  you better stop  you re making him mad 
whatever you say 
your friend here   
party a little too hard tonight 
i m the designated driver 
well  you re driving with a busted tail light 
i ll let you off with a warning 
what next 
the tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits 
i shove the t bird the rest of the way 
a few minutes  more work
and it ll all be over 
jackie boy
will go into the damn tar pits 
i ll catch a train out of sacred oaks 
go home and call it a   
no more questions  dallas 
do what i say 
clear the streets 
we re in lockdown 
we re not selling any tail in old town 
not tonight 
don t struggle 
you ll only hurt yourself 
your cause is lost 
we know everything 
soon the corpse of detective rafferty
will be in our possession 
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered 
there ll be arrests 
there ll be deaths 
my employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood 
you will all be slaves 
nothing can stop this 
but it is within your power
to save many lives
by facilitating the process of transition 
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of old town 
son of a bitch 
i know you 
i have suffered your kind before  
the dregs of sin city 
i serve a new master now 
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well 
now  get dressed and shed a tear
for dwight mccarthy if you must 
because  by now  he is surely dead 
you don t know him 
my man will find a way 
he always finds a way 
i can t fathom
these americans always whining
and going on about how they got it so bad 
this is a fine  grand country 
guiding light of the modern world  it is 
low taxes  land of opportunity 
where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we re getting for this 
sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches
without shite to show for it 
yeesh 
you find something  murphy 
looks to be a poor  dead cop s badge 
it s all bent up 
what s this stuck in it 
bloody hell 
it s the bullet 
you son of a bitch 
bastard 
they weren t cops  these four 
they were mercenaries 
and if they were hired
by who i think they were 
the bad times haven t even started yet 
and everything seemed
to be going so well 
remember  we don t have to
deliver every last inch of the man  brian 
you got a good point there  ronnie 
lend me your knife 
should i take a nap
while i m doing all this waiting 
i m at the bone  all right 
there we go 
have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life 
we ll be back for the three of you 
and if anyone happens by 
use your imagination  ok 
silence  now 
no air to breathe 
only the horrid  oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils 
let it in 
let it fill your lungs 
they were counting on you
and you blew it 
skinny  steely fingers at my wrist 
miho  you re an angel 
you re a saint 
you re mother teresa 
you re elvis 
you re god 
and if you d shown up ten minutes
earlier  we d still have jackie boy s head 
dwight  they got gail 
it s a cinch 
you got yourselves a spy in old town 
a stoolie who sold you out to the mob 
we gotta find out who it is and rescue gail 
but first  we gotta get
our hands on jackie boy s head
before it gets to wherever it s going
and this whole situation blows wide open 
miho  i hope to hell
you left one of  em alive enough to talk 
i let him know i m not fooling around 
we talk 
stay smart 
stay cool 
it s time to prove to your friends
that you re worth a damn 
sometimes  that means dying 
sometimes  it means killing
a whole lot of people 
there they are 
what do we do 
we stop  em  dallas 
jackie boy s head is so close to me
i could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there 
get the head 
i got it 
suck on this  you stupid slag 
i can t tell if miho is alive or dead 
but i m on my feet and every ounce of me
wants to get some killing done 
you want the head now  sweetheart 
so come down and get it 
brave lad 
i could ve put a bullet
straight down your ear just now 
if i hadn t got me revolver
all wet and useless 
you got the drop on me  love 
i m as helpless as a baby 
i got to come clean with you  sweetheart 
it was an outright lie i was giving ya
about me revolver being wet 
you see  i m not too fond of shootin  
it s my preference to blow things up 
once you blast the roof off a pub
and seen all the parts flying off people 
a little bang bang s
never gonna match the sight of that 
and here s me  with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote 
but it s me knife i ll be doing you with 
you killed me mates 
someone shoulda told ya   never give
an irishman good cause for revenge 
deadly little miho 
you won t feel a thing
unless she wants you to 
she twists the blade 
he feels it 
i tell miho what we re gonna do
and how we re gonna do it 
i grab poor dallas s car phone and make
the most important call of my life 
first  we gotta rescue gail 
then comes the kill 
the big  fat kill 
do we just gotta stand here
and watch this 
what  are you kidding me  man 
i could watch old manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it 
i mean  the man s an artist 
only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject 
your skin is perfect 
your nerves  responsive 
beautiful 
just give them what they want  gail 
  becky 
  it s over  gail 
there s no fighting them 
dwight s dead 
they got what s left of that cop we killed 
the mob s gonna turn it over to the police
chief  the cops are gonna mow us down 
we gotta cut a deal 
you little bitch 
you sold us out 
i didn t have no choice 
they was gonna hurt my mom 
you gotta cut a deal with these people 
it s selfish  you holding out like this 
you re gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason 
it wasn t your mom 
we could have protected her
and you know it 
it was the money  you stupid little bitch 
sure  there s money  sure  you could ve
moved my mom into old town
and let her know
that her daughter s a goddamn whore 
breaks your heart  doesn t it 
they offered me what you couldn t
never offer me   a way out 
i had to watch out for my own neck 
your neck 
your precious  scrawny  little neck 
you re crazy  you could have
ripped my throat out  you crazy whore 
schutz  fetch my blades 
  stuka  kill this one 
  no  i was promised 
stupid little bitch 
you deserve worse 
i knew there was a reason
i got out of bed this morning 
nobody 
i don t see nobody 
will you look at that 
it s right through me  guys  look 
there s something wrapped around it 
some kind of note 
give it to me 
it s poked right through me 
guys  look 
  it s starting to really hurt 
  out back  everyone 
and bring the women 
do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something 
mccarthy  you fool 
guys 
dozens of them  armed to the teeth 
i m outnumbered  outgunned 
but the alley is crooked 
dark and very narrow 
they can t surround me 
sometimes  you can beat the odds
with the careful choice of where to fight 
you can have old town  i don t care 
just give me the woman 
shut up 
dwight  don t do this 
  hey  wait a minute  something s not right 
  shut up  or i ll plug you 
of course  mr  mccarthy 
a fair trade 
she s all yours 
now  if you ll explain to me why
we shouldn t blow both of you to pieces   
dwight  what have you done 
exactly what i had to 
every step of the way 
no  it isn t right 
there wasn t no tape over his mouth 
how come there s tape over his mouth 
where to fight counts for a lot 
cute trick  mccarthy 
but it will do you no good 
but there s nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns 
no 
mccarthy  you shit 
the girls all know the score 
no escape  no surrender  no mercy 
we gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of  em 
every last one 
not for revenge 
not because they deserve it 
not because it ll make
the world a better place 
we need a heap of bloody bodies
so when mob boss wallenquist
looks over his charts of profits and losses 
he ll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of old town 
the valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing
with the pure  hateful 
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter 
and so am i 
the fire  baby 
it ll burn us both 
there s no place in this world
for our kind of fire 
my warrior woman  my valkyrie 
you ll always be mine 
always   
and never 
evenin   officer 
i don t have to introduce myself  do i 
you read the papers 
this being an election year 
you ve seen plenty of my picture 
you know who i am and what i can do 
and i m doin  you  hartigan 
cold and hard  i m doing you 
you blew my son s ear off 
you blew his arm off 
you even blew his nuts and his pecker off 
he s in a coma right now 
they say he may never come out of it 
my boy 
he could ve been the first roark to become
the president of the united states 
but you went and turned him into
a brain damaged  dickless freak 
pullin  that trigger make you feel powerful 
power don t come from a badge or a gun 
power comes from lying 
lying big  and gettin  the whole
damn world to play along with you 
once you got everybody agreeing with
what they know in their hearts ain t true 
you ve got  em by the balls 
there s what 
maybe 500 people in this hospital 
i could pump you full of bullets right now 
and i wouldn t even be arrested 
everyone would lie for me  
everyone who counts 
otherwise  all their own lies  
everything that runs sin city  
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards 
but i want you firm and fit and healthy 
i m even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery 
fix that heart condition of yours 
you re gonna keep on living a long time 
i m gonna make sure of that 
you re gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat  and shooting my boy 
and you re gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison 
disgraced  destroyed   
alone 
your wife 
you tell her the truth and she s dead 
you tell anybody the truth
and they re dead 
they won t let me testify 
i told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like i was crazy 
they talked my parents
into keeping me away 
they said that you d done things
that you didn t do 
i told them that you saved me
from that roark creep 
but they won t even check me out
to see that i m still a virgin 
i m still a virgin  still alive  
thanks to you 
they got it all backwards 
sometimes  the truth
doesn t matter like it ought 
but you ll always remember things right 
that s gonna mean a lot to me 
but stay away  nancy 
they ll kill you if you don t stay away 
don t visit me 
don t write me 
don t even say my name 
maybe you won t let me visit 
but i ll still write to you  hartigan 
i ll sign my letters  cordelia   
that s the name of a really cool
detective in books i read 
i ll write you every week    for forever 
sure  kid 
now  run on home 
it s not safe for you here 
bye  nancy 
i love you 
john hartigan 
mr  law and order 
mr  by the book 
mr  high and mighty 
i gotta give you credit  being such
a straight arrow for so damn many years
without it catching up with you 
it s catching up with you now 
friend of mine 
it s catching up with you but good 
maybe i oughta look at him 
he doesn t look too good 
he s hale and hearty  tammy  see 
he s the picture of health 
that tammy  there   she s fine  isn t she 
i rented her out of old town 
i wanted to show you what you won t
be getting any of  not in prison 
you hear me  hartigan 
if you stop being stupid 
start playing along with us 
you might just get some of tammy 
you see that 
she flinched 
you make her sick 
she heard about you and that little girl 
this is nothing but a price i promised
myself i d pay  and i m paying it 
you don t save a little girl s life  then
turn around and throw her to the dogs 
not in my book  you don t 
they want a confession 
they won t get it 
there was a letter from nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary 
she calls herself  cordelia  
just like she promised 
she makes no mention of anything
that would give her away 
at first  i figure
she ll send another note or two
before her young mind
moves on to better things 
but every thursday  another one arrives 
what a sweet kid 
i do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when i reach for it 
she s the only friend i ve got  
the daughter i never had 
my sweet cordelia 
skinny little nancy callahan 
eight years pass 
then comes a thursday
when i bound from my cot 
excited as a kid at christmas 
only to find myself
staring at the damn floor of my damn cell 
looking for a letter from nancy
that isn t there 
then another thursday with no letter 
is she all right 
did something happen to her 
nothing 
two months now  
not a word from nancy 
did they find her 
did they get to her 
of course 
stupid old man 
do your math 
nancy s 19 years old 
how long did you expect her
to keep writing 
she was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did 
she s forgotten you  old man 
you re alone 
you re all alone 
this guy smells awful  
like bad food 
like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer 
he stinks so bad  i want to throw up 
practically knocked my head off 
the bastard 
when i come to  i see it 
the same kind of envelope
nancy always uses 
but there s no letter inside of it 
there s something soft 
something that ought to be alive  
a hunk of meat and bone
that ought to be the index finger
of the right hand of a 19 year old girl 
how the hell did they find her 
she was so careful 
she never gave away
where she lives or where she works 
i ve got to get out 
i ve got to help her 
nothing else matters  
not my life and not my pride  either 
it s only one final surrender they want 
you got me  roark 
you beat me 
i say everything they want to hear 
just the way they want to hear it 
i tell them i m a twisted 
wretched child molester 
i agree to everything they want from me 
i love you  nancy 
it s a lot of miles into town  hartigan 
  you care for a ride 
  long as you stay in front of me 
prison s made you paranoid 
talk about water under the bridge 
christ 
eight years 
well  if it s any consolation to you   
you made me hate myself 
any word from eileen 
she got remarried four years ago 
she had two kids 
i m sorry  john 
don t be 
i m glad 
eileen always wanted kids 
she ll make a good mother 
like you said  bob  
water under the bridge 
bob and i get on
with our fond farewells to each other 
then i go looking for the only human being
on the planet who means a damn to me  
nancy 
how could they have found out it was you
writing all those letters to me 
how did they find out who you are 
and what have they done to you  baby 
not a sound 
no sign of life 
has roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man 
like a kid poking at a fly
when he s already torn his wings off 
what has he done to nancy 
it s like all she ever does
is read and study and write 
no diary  no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere 
closest thing to a clue
is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon 
it s a long shot 
but maybe she s got some friends there 
a dead end 
nancy wouldn t have anything to do
with a pack of drunks and losers like this 
but if there s anything to be found here 
the faintest lead to wherever nancy is
or whoever kidnapped her
and mutilated her  this is the place 
excuse me  miss  wondering if you
could help me  i m looking for somebody 
cold night like this  everybody s
looking for somebody  stranger 
it s not like that 
her name is nancy 
eyes to the stage  pilgrim 
she s just warming up 
skinny little nancy callahan 
she grew up 
she filled out 
nancy callahan  19 years old 
and here i was 
expecting a skinny little bookworm 
maybe a bit too shy for her own good 
how little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years 
how the hell did they find her 
then it hits me 
they were bluffing 
i ve led them straight to her 
she hasn t spotted you yet 
turn around and walk out the door 
lead the creep outside 
get that beretta away from him somehow 
and kill him 
i m just a horny ex con
watching an exotic dancer 
just a few seconds and she ll be safe 
no  nancy 
don t notice me 
don t recognize me 
there s no time to explain 
i ve made a terrible mistake 
put you in terrible danger 
we need to get out of here
right this second 
whatever you say  hartigan 
let me throw some clothes on 
and here i d figured you d forgotten
all about me  me and my dumb letters 
kept me going 
kept me from killing myself 
hurry up  will you 
  maybe i should drive 
  not a chance 
nobody but me
can keep this heap running 
besides  from the sound of things 
you might have to shoot somebody 
  i don t have a gun 
  under the seat 
it s loaded and it works 
yeah  this ll do 
taken it to the range a couple of times 
kicks like a mule 
hartigan  there s so much
i ve wanted to say to you 
you ve never been far from my thoughts 
i ve lain awake nights  thinking of you 
what are you talking about 
keep driving  nancy 
keep driving and keep the car on the road 
she s counting on you  old man 
what are you doing 
prove you re still worth a damn 
try and keep it on the road  nancy 
he s a decent shot 
he s got skill 
but he s in too much of a hurry 
throwing away bullets
like they were candy 
he doesn t know how to take his time 
aim careful and look the devil in the eye 
stop the car  nancy 
gotta confirm the kill 
  what 
  stop the car  now 
right 
stop the car  confirm the kill 
sorry  i got a little rattled 
it s ok  you did great 
sit tight  i ll be right back 
no 
let me stay close 
nothing can happen to me
when i m with you 
please 
let me stay close 
the stink   i almost gag 
his blood smells
even worse than he does 
  jesus 
  and it s all over the place 
but the creep himself  he s gone 
we re out of time 
the sirens   i used to welcome the sound 
there s nothing to do now
but find a place to hole up for the night 
get nancy calmed down  and figure out
what on earth i m going to do next 
the stink   somehow it stays with us
all the way to the motel 
nancy  i went to your apartment 
your window was thrown wide open 
the rooms looked almost empty 
that s why i was sure
you d been kidnapped 
my window  robbed again 
that s the third time this year 
i swore if i ever saw you again 
i d show you i grew up strong 
but there i was  just like before 
scared and helpless 
  i m such an asshole 
  you should sit down 
you ll feel a little bit better if you sit down 
i ve never been all that good with people 
when it comes to reassuring
a traumatized 19 year old 
i m as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench 
it s always been you  hartigan 
all these years 
it s just nerves
making you say that  nancy 
you re just exhausted 
you need to sleep 
  sleep with me 
  stop it  nancy 
eight years 
why do you think
i kept writing you those letters 
it wasn t just gratitude 
i tried to fall in love with boys 
even thought i did once or twice 
but i was already in love    with you 
that s enough 
jesus christ 
i m old enough to be your grandfather 
  you re just scared 
  i m not scared 
no 
there s wrong and there s wrong
and then there s this 
for god s sakes  you re just a kid 
i love you 
i love you  too 
with all my heart 
cold shower  it helps 
no  nancy 
recognize my voice  hartigan 
recognize my voice 
you piece of shit cop 
i look different 
but i bet you can recognize my voice 
sure 
i recognize your voice  junior 
everything s gone straight to hell 
i ve been suckered
into betraying the only friend i ve got 
and put her in the hands of a murdering
rapist i thought i d put down for good 
suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator 
it s all gone to hell 
klump  it s me 
i got a dead man needs to be fetched 
i want you to set me up for a party 
i ve already got the girl  you dumb shit 
hey  it better be perfect
or i m calling my dad 
my tools better be clean and sharp 
it better be ready 
it better be perfect 
i get to do whatever i want 
however i want  whenever i want it 
my dad   i d love him if i didn t hate him 
he spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet
to grow back that equipment
you blew off from between my legs 
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid 
although  as you can see 
there were some side effects 
i m not complaining  though 
since you ve been gone 
i ve been having the time of my life 
and now you ve led me back
to your darling cordelia 
we all wondered
who wrote all those letters 
she left not a clue 
clever girl 
and so pretty  so pretty 
a little old for my taste 
but i can forgive that just this once 
nancy  don t scream 
whatever he does to you  don t scream 
she ll scream  i m gonna take
all night doing dear old nancy 
and you re gonna die knowing
that it s all your fault 
they ve all screamed  hartigan 
dozens of them   maybe a hundred 
eight years  worth 
every one of them has screamed 
and if there weren t
so many people hereabout 
i would show you how
i m gonna make dear old nancy scream 
it s gonna be one hell of a show 
this is it 
no way to fight it now 
no hope left 
no chance 
this is it 
this is the end 
no 
give it a shot  old man 
keep your neck tight  move 
the window   maybe there s an alarm 
keep your neck tight  goddamn it 
stay conscious 
stay conscious 
no alarm 
the glass  cut the rope 
you can do it 
it is inclement upon me
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness
in selecting such an eye catching
and impractical car to heist  mr  shlubb 
irrelevant to said mission is the following
query  which i now put forth to you 
wherein this most streamlined
and trunkless of transports  
boner inspiring though it may be  
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo 
i can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm 
tell me where roark takes the girls
or i ll cut your damn head off 
in plain english  creep 
the answer you seek is rural 
even agrarian 
the farm 
that s all i need to hear 
every cop on the force
knows about the roark family s farm
and to stay away from it 
shlubb and klump
were packing an arsenal 
once things get loud 
i ll probably have use for the cannons 
but at first  i ll have to play it quiet 
quiet and nasty 
nancy s car  six miles from the farm 
 nobody but me can keep
this heap running    she told me 
good girl 
the car stalled out on that yellow bastard
and you didn t tell him
how to start it up again 
you kept your mouth shut 
i ll bet junior was furious 
i ll bet he slapped you around
something fierce 
but you stayed strong 
you bought a few extra minutes 
there s still a chance  nancy 
don t scream 
i ditch the car a mile or so from the farm
and make my way through the woods 
i m not halfway there when it hits 
my heart 
can t be my heart 
i was cured 
bad cough   blood in it 
doesn t matter now 
i don t have to stay alive
that much longer  anyway 
rotten way to kill a man  but it s quiet 
hate yourself later 
you re only making this worse for yourself 
you stupid cow 
do you think i m tired 
is that it 
do you think i m getting tired 
you re the one who s gonna crack 
you ll crack 
you ll cry and beg 
you ll scream 
oh  yeah  you ll scream 
you big  fat  ugly cow 
you re thinking the whip
was the worst i could do 
that was foreplay 
hartigan was right about you 
you can t get it up unless i scream 
you re pathetic 
you re pathetic 
it s not wise at all
to make fun of me like that 
it brings out the worst in me 
stupid old man 
in too much of a hurry 
damn 
it can t be 
charging in like galahad 
just like i told myself i wouldn t 
stupid old man 
  you tagged him good 
  don t take no chances  perforate the fool 
good advice 
give it up  junior 
it s over 
let her go 
you re dreaming  hartigan 
i get to see your eyes while i fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you 
look at you 
you re about to keel over 
you can t even lift that cannon 
sure  i can 
you gave me a scare there
for a second there  old man 
nancy  i m sorry 
i m taking no chances with you 
first i soften you up 
and then it s showtime 
here it comes 
it s gonna hurt 
you re right about that 
sucker 
i take away his weapon 
both of them 
eight long years  son of a bitch 
after a while  all i m doing is pounding
wet chunks of bone into the floorboards 
so i stop 
so long  junior 
been a pleasure 
i didn t scream  hartigan  not once 
i didn t scream 
i know it  baby 
you grew up strong 
by the time i get her to the car 
nancy stops shaking 
her skin is warm again 
she s herself again 
thanks for remembering my coat 
and for all the little things 
like saving my life  twice 
  you better get rolling 
  you re not coming along 
no  i have friends on their way 
to collect evidence 
i m gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open 
i m gonna clear my name 
i m gonna put senator roark
behind bars where he belongs 
i can t lose you  not again 
you ll never lose me  nancy 
nancy callahan  the love of my life 
shame to lie to her 
i hope she forgives me for it 
get senator roark behind bars 
sure 
and maybe after i ve pulled off
that miracle  i ll go and punch out god 
there isn t a prosecutor in the state
who ll go after senator roark 
i killed his only son 
the bloodline is cut 
roark s lost his goddamn legacy 
he ll use all his power
to get revenge on me 
he ll go after me through nancy 
he ll find her again 
there ll be no end to it 
she ll never be safe 
not as long as i m alive 
there s only one way to beat him 
an old man dies 
a young woman lives 
fair trade 
i love you  nancy 
yes 
oh  mom  don t go on like that 
it s not the city  i could ve gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere 
yeah  just a fracture 
the doctor said it s a clean break 
it should be right as rain in no time 
turn the right corner in sin city
