the wind rises electric
shes soft and warm
and almost weightless
her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes
i tell her that everything will be all right
that ill save her from whatever
shes scared of and take her far far away
i tell her i love her
the silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot
i hold her close until shes gone
ill never know
what she was running from
ill cash her check in the morning
just one hour to go
my last day on the job
early retirement
not my idea
doctors orders
heart condition
angina he calls it
im polishing my badge and getting myself
used to the idea of saying goodbye to it
it and the 30odd years
of protecting and serving and tears
and the blood and terror
and triumph it represents
im thinking about eileens slow smile
about the thick fat steaks
she picked up at the butchers today
and im thinking about
the one loose end i havent tied up
a young girl whos out there somewhere
helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic

hes a very nice man
halfway to the warehouse where
weevil said they took her and it hits
icked spot of indigestion
at least thats what i pray it is
lighthearted
and momentary digression
the briefest indulgement
in automotive pleasure
for cheap thrills
such shortlived durability mr shlubb
you would risk engenderating ill will
on the part of our employers
burt shlubb and douglas klump
two anydirtyjobthereis thugs
with delusions of eloquence
this jaguar you so pinheadedly covet
temporarily remanded
to our custody though it may be
remains the property
of the son of senator roark
gotta keep this quiet
take em down fast
a single dent
the merest scratch thereupon
and the beforementioned consequences
of which i so recently made mention

an old man dies
a little girl lives
fair trade
the night is hot as hell
its a lousy room
in a lousy part of a lousy town
im staring at a goddess
shes telling me she wants me
im not gonna waste one more second
wondering how ive gotten so lucky
i want you
she smells like angels ought to smell
the perfect woman
the goddess
i need you
goldie
she says her name is goldie
three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big
and that cold thing
happens to my stomach
and i realize goldies dead
not a mark on her
youd have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers
arent moving like they would
if she was breathing
she was murdered
and i was right here when it happened
lying next to her
stone drunk just like she was
damn it goldie who were you
and who wanted you dead
who were you
besides an angel of mercy
giving a twotime loser like me
the night of his life
it sure as hell wasnt my looks
so why the sleazy saloon
why the kindness goldie
the cops  theyre telling me too much
showing up before anybody
but me and the killer
could know theres been a murder
somebody paid good money
for this frame
no reason at all to play it quiet
no reason to play it any way but my way
whoever killed you is gonna pay goldie
open up police
ill be right out
i dont know why you died goldie
i dont know why and i dont know how
i never even met you before tonight
but you were a friend and more
when i needed one
and when i find out who did it
it wont be quick and quiet
like it was with you
itll be loud and nasty  my kind of kill
and when his eyes go dead
the hell i send him to
will seem like heaven
after what ive done to him
i love you goldie
claire
now dont worry lucille
i was just grazed
you got any beers around this place
no way am i giving you any alcohol
besides its not what
you came here for anyway is it
no

thanks
youre the best
lucilles my parole officer
shes a dyke but god knows why
its that body of hers
she could have any man she wants
the pills come from a girlfriend
whos a shrink
she tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared
havent seen you like this in a while
got in a fight with some cops
didnt happen to kill any of them did ya
not that i know of but they know theyve
been in a fight thats for damn sure
how the hell do you suppose
im gonna square this with the board
there aint no squaring it
not this time
this isnt some barroom brawl
or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone
hey hey
this is big
settle down marv take another pill
hey there aint no settlin down
this is blood for blood and by the gallons
this is the old days and the bad days
the allornothing days

theres no choices left
and im ready for war
prison was hell for you marv
its gonna be life this time
hells waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why youre here
but im out now
it took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it
but im out
i know exactly what i gotta do
so you were scared
werent you goldie
somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it
so you hit the saloons the bad places
looking for the biggest
meanest lug around and finding me
well im gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you
and im gonna give him the hard goodbye
walk down
the right back alley in sin city
leave your hands off nancy
and you could find anything
that coat looks like baghdad
so does your face
take off
hes new here marv
he didnt know
kadies is my kind of joint
nancys just getting started with her gig
but already the crowds breathing hard
plenty of nights ive drooled over nancy
shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me
but thats not what im lookin for tonight
whatll it be marv
a shot and a brew shellie
and keep em comin
sure honey
you take it slow now
most people think marv is crazy
he just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century
hed be right at home
on some ancient battlefield
swinging an ax into somebodys face
or in a roman arena
taking a sword to other gladiators like him
theyd have tossed him girls
like nancy back then
shows over dickwad
drink up
now thats one finelooking coat
youre wearing there
your killin days are over
you overthehill dogooder son of a bitch
i love hit men no matter what
you do to them you dont feel bad
take it off
what
a fine coat like that
and youre bleeding all over it
all right its all yours
oh god
it wasnt you losers who killed goldie
the guy who did that
he knew what he was doing
so tell me man
who sent you
i dont hear you giving me any names
so i guess when i shot you in the belly
i aimed a little too high
you keep holding out on me like this
and im gonna have to get really nasty
it was telly
telly stern passed me the order
he runs the tables over
to the triple ace club
thanks again
then the damnedest thing happens
for a second i smell the angel smell
that belonged to my goldie
just need my medicine is all
bastard
youre gonna pay for what you did to me
feel like talking louie
how many got paid off
for the frame louie huh
how many for the kill
it was connelly
he set me up
hell never talk
i dont know about you
but im havin a ball
connelly talks
they all talk
and what have been
your sins my son
well padre
i dont want to keep you up all night
so ill just fill you in on the latest batch
these here hands of mine
they got blood all over em
youre speaking figuratively
when i need to find something out
i just go out and look for somebody
that knows more than me
and i go and i ask them
sometimes i ask pretty hard
by way of a for instance
i killed three men tonight
tortured em first
you might say i been
working my way up the food chain
first two were minnows
smalltime messengers
but it was connelly the money man
who fingered you padre
dear lord man
this is a house of god
just give me a damn name
roark
you really are pushing your luck padre
feeding me garbage like that
it cant be that big
theres a farm
at north cross and lennox
its all there
find out for yourself
and while youre at it
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for
worth dying for
worth killing for
worth going to hell for
amen
his keys say the padre drove a mercedes
or at least thats what theyre
passing off as a mercedes these days
modern cars
they all look like electric shavers
goldie
goldie
it couldnt be goldie
its my own fault and nobody elses
that i got confused
ive been having so much fun
i forgot to take my medicine
that wasnt goldie back there
goldies dead
and thats the whole reason
that ive been doing what ive been doing
when you got a condition
its bad to forget your medicine
the cold thing it creeps into my gut
and tells me one more time it wont let go
this is a bad place this farm
people have died here
the wrong way
i dont want to fight pooch
i got no gripe with you
easy boy
no way i was gonna use
my gun on you buddy
its whoever owns you im curious about
because theres blood on your breath
and i think i know what kind
so i sniff around to see whats buried
here we go
its impossible
nobody can sneak up on me
i go blind
not a sound nobodys that quiet
nobody except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago
it was you you bastard
you killed her
you killed goldie
it was
i blew it goldie
i found your killer
but he was better than me
too quiet too quick
a killer born
why didnt he finish the job
he keeps the heads
he eats the rest
lucille
its not just that wolf of his
the wolf just gets scraps
bones
its him
he eats people
he cooks them like they were steaks
lets get you warm
just like they were steaks
now hes got both of us
its all right
take a nice slow breath
just look at the heads on the wall
the heads on the wall
the heads on the wall
son of a bitch
he kept smiling that damned smile
he made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers
he made me watch
oh jesus
he made me watch
christ i could use a cigarette
dames
sometimes all they gotta do is let it out
and a few buckets later
theres no way youd know
youve brought us
some big trouble this time marv
whoevers behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department
any leads
one guy i talked to told me
it was roark running the show
whoever it is he knew i was checking out
that hooker almost before i did
what hooker
the one youve been obsessing over
the dead one
goldie
i didnt know she was a hooker
doesnt make any difference
about anything
but i didnt know that
she was highclass stuff
she must have shown you quite a time
quiet
theres a car coming
kevin
all ive got is a face and a name
ill see you later kevin
lets go
theyre done checking the house
theyre coming this way
bastards
ill show them
youre not gonna get
either of us killed marv
no dont shoot
please
listen to me
im his parole officer
hes unconscious and unarmed
so theres no need to kill him
captain the target  theres no sign of him
heres a sign
that there is one
damn fine coat youre wearing
i keep coming back to that cop i just killed
and what he told me
i was pretty steamed about
what hed done to lucille
so i took my time
with that son of a bitch
it wasnt till i showed him
all those pieces of himself that he said it
just a name
patrick henry roark man of the cloth
couldve become president
but he chose to serve god
along the way he happened to become
the most powerful man in the state
hes brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing
he even made his rotten brother
a us senator without breaking a sweat
and here hes gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker
im getting used to the idea
more and more im liking the sound of it
then it hits me like a kick in the nuts
what if im wrong
ive got a condition
i get confused sometimes
and with lucille dead
i cant get my medicine
what if ive imagined all of this
what if ive finally turned into what
theyve always said i was gonna turn into
a maniac
a psycho killer
cant kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to
ive gotta know for sure
the merchandise is on display
by the time i make my way to old town
for an hour or so
i asked around about goldie
i dont get any answers
but i know im bound to
lucille said goldie was a hooker
and if she was she has roots here
friends maybe even family
you cant be goldie
goldies dead
goldie
yeah sure right
i havent eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now
no wonder im seeing things
bastard
hes crazy
hit him again wendy
harder
wait a minute
why did she call you wendy
because thats my name you ape
goldie was my sister
my twin sister
i guess she was the nice one
goldie and the other six  where are they
what did you do to them
you crazy goddamn broad
just take a look at this mug
would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you
none of you would but goldie
and she only did because
she thought i could protect her
and ill bet those cops didnt do a damn
thing about those other girls did they
but as soon as they had me for a fall guy
they showed up guns blazing
but they didnt get me and ive been killing
my way to the truth ever since
so go ahead doll
shoot me now
or get the hell out of my way
nuts
ok im glad we got all that sorted out
what the hell
i tied those knots thats my specialty
you sat there and took it
when you couldve taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to
well sure i thought i might be able
to talk some sense into you
and i probably would have had
to paste you one
and i dont hurt girls
i need a pair of handcuffs
what style do you want
i got a collection
just give him the ones
you got with you gail
it was a farm boy named kevin
who killed goldie
but it was cardinal roark
who was behind it and i dont know why
i know that sounds crazy
no it doesnt
goldie worked the clergy
just like that a whopper of a puzzle piece
falls smack in my lap
im too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet
but she fires up two cigarettes and hands
me one and i taste her lipstick on it
and suddenly my hearts pounding
so loud i cant hear anything else
i want to reach over and touch her
and taste goldies sweat one more time
but she isnt goldie
yeah yeah
thisll do
im also gonna be needing a dozen
twofoot lengths of this rubber tubing
and a spool of razor wire
and a pair of those special gloves
thatll let me handle the wire
beefing up
the old home security huh
you can bet your ass
she was my sister
so im in this one to the end
but why are you willing to go up against
roark for someone you barely knew
she was nice to me gave me
something i didnt even know existed
i wasnt never even able to buy a woman
you know the way i look
i take my mind off her
and i crawl back inside myself
its almost killing time
and id better get sharp
i check the list
rubber tubing gas saw
gloves cuffs razor wire hatchet
gladys and my mitts
were close enough pull over
yes marv
keep the engine runnin
if im not back in 20 minutes you get
the hell outta here and dont look back
kill him for me marv
kill him good
i wont let you down goldie
heading downstairs to the kitchen
getting himself a midnight snack
and i can guess what kind
come on you son of a bitch
damn hes slick
is that the best you can do creep
thats right
get personal get close i can take it
i got you you little bastard
lets see you hop around now
i try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs
my muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come
let me do it marv
she was my sister let me finish him
you wasnt supposed
to come down here wendy
oh but i want to
im sorry kid
but i havent even started with this creep
and i dont want you watching the rest
itll give you nightmares
god i gotta tell you im good and bushed
and its not that fight of ours
that did me in either
its all that sawing and tying
its not as easy as it looks
could have been a real mess around here
if i didnt have that tubing for tourniquets
i gotta admit
there was a spurt or two
to get the scent in the air
to get that friend of yours to come running
well what do you know
look whos here
here he comes
thats a good dog
he doesnt scream
not even when the mutts had its fill
and kevins guts
are lying all over the place
somehow the bastard is still alive
still staring at me
not even when i grab the saw
and finish the job
he never screams
i put in a call to kadies
and ask nancy to get her clothes on
and meet me at her place
she says yes like always
hey nancy you got any beers
sure marv
whos the babe
there isnt much of anything
nancy wouldnt do for me
not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up
and i straightened him out but good
it really gets my goat
when guys rough up dames
so what do you want me to do with her
well your best bet is
drive her all the way up to sacred oaks
what about you
are you leaving town
hell no
i like it here
i hotwire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit
so as not to get any attention
my head starts to clear
things start to make sense
i owe you goldie
i owe you one and im gonna pay up
so if going after roark
means dying win or lose
hell ill die laughing
if i know ive done this one thing right
quiet as a grave out here
no sign of target
all right keep a lookout
kevin
whats left of him anyways
the dog ate the rest
oh my god
you monster
you demon
dont scream or ill plug you
he had the voice of an angel
yet he spoke only to me
and hes dead now
because of one stupid whore
its not a real good idea for you to talk
about goldie that way while im around
when he came to me
he was a tormented boy
tormented by guilt
i tried to counsel him
but the eating  it filled him with white light
tearful he swore to me
that he felt the touch of god almighty
what the hell do you know
i know its pretty damn weird to eat people
he didnt just eat their bodies
he ate their souls
and i joined in
they were all whores
nobody cared for them
nobody missed them
and then your goldie
almost ruined everything
she stayed in public places
and then with you
you were so convenient
youd broke a mans jaw that very night
who would believe a thug like you
kevin killed her
i ordered the police in for you
but you wouldnt be caught
you wouldnt stop
and now hes dead and youre here to
eliminate me
will that give you satisfaction my son
killing a helpless old fart
the killing no
no satisfaction
everything up until the killing will be a gas
kevin
were going home
you can scream now if you want to
its beautiful goldie
its just like i promised only better
and when his eyes go dead
the hell i sent him to must seem like
heaven after what ive done to him
freeze
oh my god
jerks
they shouldve shot me in the head
and enough times to make sure
its so stupid
everybody knows whats coming
but they go through the motions anyway
what a waste of time
months fall off the calendar
while i breathe and eat through tubes
night after night i wait for somebody
to come and finish me off
after a while
i realize its not gonna be so easy as that
im on my feet for about ten minutes
before the cops kick them out
from under me
they dont ask me any questions
they just keep knocking the crap out of
me and waving a confession in my face
and i keep spitting blood all over it
and laughing at how many fresh copies
they come up with
then along comes this worm assistant
district attorney who turns the recorder off
and says if i dont sign their confession
theyll kill my mom
i break his arm in three places
and i sign it
from then on
its the circus everybody wants it to be
they nail me for the works
not just the people i did kill
but even lucille and the girls
that roark and kevin ate
and even goldie
the judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence
midnight and my death
are only a few hours away
when i get my first surprise in 18 months
my only visitor
im ready for anything but that scent
i got em for you good
didnt i goldie
oh im sorry wendy
i got confused again
just seeing you like this
you can call me goldie
she smells like angels ought to smell
the perfect woman
the goddess
goldie
she says her name is goldie
they fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal
they even throw in a brew
its the first ive had since back at nancys
then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it
and its about damned time
if you ask me
yea though i walk through the valley
of the shadow of death
would you get a move on
i havent got all night
you heard the man
hit it
is that the best you can do you pansies
hes gone
forget it man
you can bang on that door
all night if you want to
there is no way in hell im letting you in
i cant believe
youre doing this to me shellie
everything weve shared
it has to mean something to you
ha it meant plenty
plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to flirt with a waitress
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises
i know youre angry baby
and i forgive you for that
without you even asking me to
theres a difference
between getting honked off
at a guy whos generally not so bad
and finding out that youve been
sweettalked by a total jerk loser
who skips out on a wife
that he doesnt even tell you about
every time he gets drunk
which is way too often
especially the kind of total jerk loser
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man
that hurt shellie
its one thing for you to play hard to get
but dont go trying to cut my nuts off
i am impossible to get
do yourself a favor jackie boy

and it was only cause i felt sorry for him
and it was only once
ive done some dumb things
seeing as how
im one of those dumb things
i cant give you
too hard a time about that shellie
but this guy hes a menace
he might kill somebody if i dont stop him
ill call you later
no dont go
shellie shouts something
i cant quite make out
over the racket of a passing police copter
stop
it sounds like stop but i cant be sure
its a chance i shouldnt be taking
but i cant just go home and forget about it
and let jackie boy and his pals
find their fun
theyre a pack of predators and theyre
out for blood tonight  a womans blood
damn it dwight
damn it
you fool
you damned fool
i cut my caddy across the park
to pick up jackie boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill
im speeding
thats a good way to get yourself noticed
and if youre a murderer with a new face
whos one fingerprint check away from
the fast track to the gas chamber like i am
the last thing you want
is to get noticed
i dont have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop and even if i did
theres always the outside chance
hes one of the honest ones
do i try to talk my way out of this
or do i take this cop down and risk it all
then jackie boy saves me
a great big steaming pile of trouble
watch it jack
cops
theyre right on our ass
not for long
not where were headed
my gut tightens up
jackie boys leading us
straight to old town
the cop shuts off his siren
he knows hes not the law
not in old town
the ladies are the law here
beautiful and merciless
if youve got the cash
and you play by the rules
theyll make all your dreams come true
but if you cross em youre a corpse
hey baby
hop in sugar
well get you there
sweetheart i work the day shift
and its been a long day
besides i dont do group jobs
get in the car baby
well just talk itll be nice
i dont do talk jobs either
babydoll
ive had me one hell of a bad day
ive been beat up every time i turn around
but the day i get turned down by a hooker
when i got good
hardearned cash to pay her with
well
theres only so much a man can take
go try the alamo over on dillon street
thats the alamo not the amigo
the amigos a fag joint
are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all
thats far enough dwight
weve been on top of these peckerwoods
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them
everythings under control
enjoy the show
theres no use arguing with her
the ladies are their own enforcers
so hows the barmaid
you know the one that never shuts up
not right now gail
wound up a little tight arent we
thats your whole problem dwight
you worry too much
that and your lousy taste in women
these days anyway
damn it gail
not right now
those clowns down the way
they some of the barmaids boyfriends
one of them thinks he is
hes outta control
i followed them here to make sure
he didnt hurt any of the girls
us helpless little girls
all kinds of death is about to hit
less than 20 yards ahead of us
and still its hard to take my eyes off her
us girls are safe as we can be lancelot
those boys in that chrysler
are one mistake away
from seeing what miho can do
and shes been aching for some practice
she guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roofs edge
deadly little miho
youre running out of alley cowboy
turn around save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief
youre a sassy little thing
you aint hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats
the trap is set
locked and ready to spring
so what theyre scum
they deserve whats coming
so why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong
they havent killed anybody i know about
it got pretty bad at shellies place
but they didnt kill anybody
and they wont
why this rotten feeling
something shellie said
i cant place it
ok ok ok i sounded off
a little more than i should have
im a little on edge
over the edge
its not a woman you need
its a good nights sleep
you couldnt handle a woman
the state youre in
shes saying you aint got
what it takes jack
you wanna see it
you wanna see what i got
ive seen all shapes all sizes
you seen this one
get in the car
oh sugar you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life
oh god no
this is crazy
out of nowhere for no reason at all
go ahead
hes got the drop on her
hes got squat
hes dead
hes just too damn dumb to know it
i got you right where i want you
this is a careerending wound whore
and theres gonna be hell to pay
watch your step jackie boy
this isnt funny
dont anyone laugh
i got friends you cant imagine
every one of you is gonna burn
hang it up
shes just playing with you
youre only making it worse
you shut the hell up
dont pull the trigger
she blocked the barrel itll backfire
i told you to shut up
i cant see
whats happening
i cant see
i cant hear anything
for gods sake miho finish him
make it quick will you
she doesnt quite chop his head off
she makes a pez dispenser out of him
then its straight to business  stretching
the corpses out on the alley floor
and going through their pockets
divvying up cash when they find it
im fishing around in jackie boys pants
his wallet is packed
mastercard discover
platinum american express
and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties
that im not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets
then i find an atom bomb
jackie boy
you son of a bitch
there was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket
i couldnt quite make out what she said
i thought shellie said stop
she said cop
detective lieutenant jack rafferty
iron jack the papers call him
a goddamn hero cop
its held for years the shaky truce
the cops get a slice of the profits and free
entertainment when they throw a party
the girls get to administer
their own brand of justice
they get to defend their own turf
if a cop blunders into the neighborhood
and hes not shopping for what the girls
are selling they send him packing
but they send him back alive
thats the rules
thats the truce
the cops stay out
that keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out
old town will be left wide open
itll be war
the streets will run red with blood
womens blood
the cops
the mob
things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be
the hell they will
we got guns
well fight the cops and the mob
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us
well go to war
dont be stupid
you wouldnt stand a chance
get me a car
make sure its a hardtop
with a decent engine
ill hide the bodies
did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here
the cops know rafferty came here
theyll check the river
theyll check the sewer
theyll find him
and come gunning for us
ill haul the bodies to the pits
the cops wont check the pits
get that gun out of my face or ill smack ya
who do you think you are giving orders
you got what you wanted out of us
shut up gail
you got what you wanted out of me
and you were gone
off playing with that barmaid
gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us
miho moves to my back
one word from gail
and shell cut me in half
theyll be watching the roads
theyll catch you
itll be the bad old days all over again
the pimps the beatings
the drugs the rapes
they wont be watching the roads not yet
they wont get me a damn hardtop
if i dont make it you can have your war
get that gun out of my face now
bastard
i forgot how quick you are
my warrior woman
she almost yanks my head clean off
shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts
an explosion that blasts away
the dull gray years
between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine
a hardtop with a decent engine
and make sure its got a big trunk
ill always love you baby
always and never
whered you find that heap
just look at that trunk
well never fit em all in
gail unless theres something else
you want me to do
you think maybe i could go home
all this blood and stuffs got me kind of
feeling like maybe im gonna hurl
sure becky go home
but dont you talk to anybody
not even your mom
theyll never fit in that trunk
not like this they wont
miho
dry your hair as soon as you get home
youll catch cold if you dont
hey becky
gail said no calls
i just want to hear my moms voice
i wont tell her nothing
please dont say nothing to gail
hey mom
dizzy dames
what were they thinking sticking me
with a beatup bucket of bolts like this
we were barely able to get the trunk
to stay closed as it was
we packed it so tight
there wasnt anything we could do
but pile jackie boy in right next to me
out where anybody who cares to look
will see him
go ahead take one of his cigarettes
itll help
its got you smoking there bud
you shut the hell up jackie boy
youre dead
im just imagining this so shut the hell up
well it tells you something
about your state of mind dont it
its got you hearing things
its got your nerves shot
its got you smoking
you know its true
nobody ever really quits
a smokers a smoker
when the chips are down
and your chips are down
im fine you shut the hell up
will you look at that
those hookers let you down
what are you gonna do
when you run outta gas call aaa
you sucker for the babes you
you aint even gonna make it to the pits
you shut the hell up
ill make it
not unless you keep
your eyes on the road sugar pie
watch it
this is great
just like being in a buddy movie
shut up
boy youre screwed
its over
youre flushed
this time i cant bring myself
to tell him to shut up
sure hes an asshole
sure hes dead
sure im just imagining that hes talking
none of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right
i dont have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop
not in this heap
pull over
the only question left
is whether im gonna kill him or not
tough call
for all i know
hes an honest cop regular guy
a working stiff with a mortgage
a wife and a pile of kids
my hand moves all on its own
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer
i dont know what to do
you better stop youre making him mad
whatever you say
your friend here
party a little too hard tonight
im the designated driver
well youre driving with a busted tail light
ill let you off with a warning
what next
the tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits
i shove the tbird the rest of the way
a few minutes more work
and itll all be over
jackie boy
will go into the damn tar pits
ill catch a train out of sacred oaks
go home and call it a
no more questions dallas
do what i say
clear the streets
were in lockdown
were not selling any tail in old town
not tonight
dont struggle
youll only hurt yourself
your cause is lost
we know everything
soon the corpse of detective rafferty
will be in our possession
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered
therell be arrests
therell be deaths
my employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood
you will all be slaves
nothing can stop this
but it is within your power
to save many lives
by facilitating the process of transition
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of old town
son of a bitch
i know you
i have suffered your kind before
the dregs of sin city
i serve a new master now
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well
now get dressed and shed a tear
for dwight mccarthy if you must
because by now he is surely dead
you dont know him
my man will find a way
he always finds a way
i cant fathom
these americans always whining
and going on about how they got it so bad
this is a fine grand country
guiding light of the modern world it is
low taxes land of opportunity
where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that were getting for this
sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches
without shite to show for it
yeesh
you find something murphy
looks to be a poor dead cops badge
its all bent up
whats this stuck in it
bloody hell
its the bullet
you son of a bitch
bastard
they werent cops these four
they were mercenaries
and if they were hired
by who i think they were
the bad times havent even started yet
and everything seemed
to be going so well
remember we dont have to
deliver every last inch of the man brian
you got a good point there ronnie
lend me your knife
should i take a nap
while im doing all this waiting
im at the bone all right
there we go
have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life
well be back for the three of you
and if anyone happens by
use your imagination ok
silence now
no air to breathe
only the horrid oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils
let it in
let it fill your lungs
they were counting on you
and you blew it
skinny steely fingers at my wrist
miho youre an angel
youre a saint
youre mother teresa
youre elvis
youre god
and if youd shown up ten minutes
earlier wed still have jackie boys head
dwight they got gail
its a cinch
you got yourselves a spy in old town
a stoolie who sold you out to the mob
we gotta find out who it is and rescue gail
but first we gotta get
our hands on jackie boys head
before it gets to wherever its going
and this whole situation blows wide open
miho i hope to hell
you left one of em alive enough to talk
i let him know im not fooling around
we talk
stay smart
stay cool
its time to prove to your friends
that youre worth a damn
sometimes that means dying
sometimes it means killing
a whole lot of people
there they are
what do we do
we stop em dallas
jackie boys head is so close to me
i could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there
get the head
i got it
suck on this you stupid slag
i cant tell if miho is alive or dead
but im on my feet and every ounce of me
wants to get some killing done
you want the head now sweetheart
so come down and get it
brave lad
i couldve put a bullet
straight down your ear just now
if i hadnt got me revolver
all wet and useless
you got the drop on me love
im as helpless as a baby
i got to come clean with you sweetheart
it was an outright lie i was giving ya
about me revolver being wet
you see im not too fond of shootin
its my preference to blow things up
once you blast the roof off a pub
and seen all the parts flying off people
a little bang bangs
never gonna match the sight of that
and heres me with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote
but its me knife ill be doing you with
you killed me mates
someone shoulda told ya  never give
an irishman good cause for revenge
deadly little miho
you wont feel a thing
unless she wants you to
she twists the blade
he feels it
i tell miho what were gonna do
and how were gonna do it
i grab poor dallass car phone and make
the most important call of my life
first we gotta rescue gail
then comes the kill
the big fat kill
do we just gotta stand here
and watch this
what are you kidding me man
i could watch old manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it
i mean the mans an artist
only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject
your skin is perfect
your nerves responsive
beautiful
just give them what they want gail
becky

theres no fighting them
dwights dead
they got whats left of that cop we killed
the mobs gonna turn it over to the police
chief the cops are gonna mow us down
we gotta cut a deal
you little bitch
you sold us out
i didnt have no choice
they was gonna hurt my mom
you gotta cut a deal with these people
its selfish you holding out like this
youre gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason
it wasnt your mom
we could have protected her
and you know it
it was the money you stupid little bitch
sure theres money sure you couldve
moved my mom into old town
and let her know
that her daughters a goddamn whore
breaks your heart doesnt it
they offered me what you couldnt
never offer me  a way out
i had to watch out for my own neck
your neck
your precious scrawny little neck
youre crazy you could have
ripped my throat out you crazy whore
schutz fetch my blades
stuka kill this one
no i was promised
stupid little bitch
you deserve worse
i knew there was a reason
i got out of bed this morning
nobody
i dont see nobody
will you look at that
its right through me guys look
theres something wrapped around it
some kind of note
give it to me
its poked right through me
guys look
its starting to really hurt
out back everyone
and bring the women
do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something
mccarthy you fool
guys
dozens of them armed to the teeth
im outnumbered outgunned
but the alley is crooked
dark and very narrow
they cant surround me
sometimes you can beat the odds
with the careful choice of where to fight
you can have old town i dont care
just give me the woman
shut up
dwight dont do this
hey wait a minute somethings not right
shut up or ill plug you
of course mr mccarthy
a fair trade
shes all yours
now if youll explain to me why
we shouldnt blow both of you to pieces
dwight what have you done
exactly what i had to
every step of the way
no it isnt right
there wasnt no tape over his mouth
how come theres tape over his mouth
where to fight counts for a lot
cute trick mccarthy
but it will do you no good
but theres nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns
no
mccarthy you shit
the girls all know the score
no escape no surrender no mercy
we gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of em
every last one
not for revenge
not because they deserve it
not because itll make
the world a better place
we need a heap of bloody bodies
so when mob boss wallenquist
looks over his charts of profits and losses
hell see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of old town
the valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing
with the pure hateful
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter
and so am i
the fire baby
itll burn us both
theres no place in this world
for our kind of fire
my warrior woman my valkyrie
youll always be mine
always
and never
evenin officer
i dont have to introduce myself do i
you read the papers
this being an election year
youve seen plenty of my picture
you know who i am and what i can do
and im doin you hartigan
cold and hard im doing you
you blew my sons ear off
you blew his arm off
you even blew his nuts and his pecker off
hes in a coma right now
they say he may never come out of it
my boy
he couldve been the first roark to become
the president of the united states
but you went and turned him into
a braindamaged dickless freak
pullin that trigger make you feel powerful
power dont come from a badge or a gun
power comes from lying
lying big and gettin the whole
damn world to play along with you
once you got everybody agreeing with
what they know in their hearts aint true
youve got em by the balls
theres what
maybe 500 people in this hospital
i could pump you full of bullets right now
and i wouldnt even be arrested
everyone would lie for me
everyone who counts
otherwise all their own lies
everything that runs sin city
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards
but i want you firm and fit and healthy
im even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery
fix that heart condition of yours
youre gonna keep on living a long time
im gonna make sure of that
youre gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat and shooting my boy
and youre gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison
disgraced destroyed
alone
your wife
you tell her the truth and shes dead
you tell anybody the truth
and theyre dead
they wont let me testify
i told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like i was crazy
they talked my parents
into keeping me away
they said that youd done things
that you didnt do
i told them that you saved me
from that roark creep
but they wont even check me out
to see that im still a virgin
im still a virgin still alive
thanks to you
they got it all backwards
sometimes the truth
doesnt matter like it ought
but youll always remember things right
thats gonna mean a lot to me
but stay away nancy
theyll kill you if you dont stay away
dont visit me
dont write me
dont even say my name
maybe you wont let me visit
but ill still write to you hartigan
ill sign my letters cordelia
thats the name of a really cool
detective in books i read
ill write you every week for forever
sure kid
now run on home
its not safe for you here
bye nancy
i love you
john hartigan
mr law and order
mr by the book
mr high and mighty
i gotta give you credit being such
a straight arrow for so damn many years
without it catching up with you
its catching up with you now
friend of mine
its catching up with you but good
maybe i oughta look at him
he doesnt look too good
hes hale and hearty tammy see
hes the picture of health
that tammy there  shes fine isnt she
i rented her out of old town
i wanted to show you what you wont
be getting any of not in prison
you hear me hartigan
if you stop being stupid
start playing along with us
you might just get some of tammy
you see that
she flinched
you make her sick
she heard about you and that little girl
this is nothing but a price i promised
myself id pay and im paying it
you dont save a little girls life then
turn around and throw her to the dogs
not in my book you dont
they want a confession
they wont get it
there was a letter from nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary
she calls herself cordelia
just like she promised
she makes no mention of anything
that would give her away
at first i figure
shell send another note or two
before her young mind
moves on to better things
but every thursday another one arrives
what a sweet kid
i do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when i reach for it
shes the only friend ive got
the daughter i never had
my sweet cordelia
skinny little nancy callahan
eight years pass
then comes a thursday
when i bound from my cot
excited as a kid at christmas
only to find myself
staring at the damn floor of my damn cell
looking for a letter from nancy
that isnt there
then another thursday with no letter
is she all right
did something happen to her
nothing
two months now
not a word from nancy
did they find her
did they get to her
of course
stupid old man
do your math
nancys 19 years old
how long did you expect her
to keep writing
she was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did
shes forgotten you old man
youre alone
youre all alone
this guy smells awful
like bad food
like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer
he stinks so bad i want to throw up
practically knocked my head off
the bastard
when i come to i see it
the same kind of envelope
nancy always uses
but theres no letter inside of it
theres something soft
something that ought to be alive
a hunk of meat and bone
that ought to be the index finger
of the right hand of a 19yearold girl
how the hell did they find her
she was so careful
she never gave away
where she lives or where she works
ive got to get out
ive got to help her
nothing else matters
not my life and not my pride either
its only one final surrender they want
you got me roark
you beat me
i say everything they want to hear
just the way they want to hear it
i tell them im a twisted
wretched child molester
i agree to everything they want from me
i love you nancy
its a lot of miles into town hartigan
you care for a ride
long as you stay in front of me
prisons made you paranoid
talk about water under the bridge
christ
eight years
well if its any consolation to you
you made me hate myself
any word from eileen
she got remarried four years ago
she had two kids
im sorry john
dont be
im glad
eileen always wanted kids
shell make a good mother
like you said bob
water under the bridge
bob and i get on
with our fond farewells to each other
then i go looking for the only human being
on the planet who means a damn to me
nancy
how could they have found out it was you
writing all those letters to me
how did they find out who you are
and what have they done to you baby
not a sound
no sign of life
has roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man
like a kid poking at a fly
when hes already torn his wings off
what has he done to nancy
its like all she ever does
is read and study and write
no diary no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere
closest thing to a clue
is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon
its a long shot
but maybe shes got some friends there
a dead end
nancy wouldnt have anything to do
with a pack of drunks and losers like this
but if theres anything to be found here
the faintest lead to wherever nancy is
or whoever kidnapped her
and mutilated her this is the place
excuse me miss wondering if you
could help me im looking for somebody
cold night like this everybodys
looking for somebody stranger
its not like that
her name is nancy
eyes to the stage pilgrim
shes just warming up
skinny little nancy callahan
she grew up
she filled out
nancy callahan 19 years old
and here i was
expecting a skinny little bookworm
maybe a bit too shy for her own good
how little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years
how the hell did they find her
then it hits me
they were bluffing
ive led them straight to her
she hasnt spotted you yet
turn around and walk out the door
lead the creep outside
get that beretta away from him somehow
and kill him
im just a horny excon
watching an exotic dancer
just a few seconds and shell be safe
no nancy
dont notice me
dont recognize me
theres no time to explain
ive made a terrible mistake
put you in terrible danger
we need to get out of here
right this second
whatever you say hartigan
let me throw some clothes on
and here id figured youd forgotten
all about me me and my dumb letters
kept me going
kept me from killing myself
hurry up will you
maybe i should drive
not a chance
nobody but me
can keep this heap running
besides from the sound of things
you might have to shoot somebody
i dont have a gun
under the seat
its loaded and it works
yeah thisll do
taken it to the range a couple of times
kicks like a mule
hartigan theres so much
ive wanted to say to you
youve never been far from my thoughts
ive lain awake nights thinking of you
what are you talking about
keep driving nancy
keep driving and keep the car on the road
shes counting on you old man
what are you doing
prove youre still worth a damn
try and keep it on the road nancy
hes a decent shot
hes got skill
but hes in too much of a hurry
throwing away bullets
like they were candy
he doesnt know how to take his time
aim careful and look the devil in the eye
stop the car nancy
gotta confirm the kill
what
stop the car now
right
stop the car confirm the kill
sorry i got a little rattled
its ok you did great
sit tight ill be right back
no
let me stay close
nothing can happen to me
when im with you
please
let me stay close
the stink  i almost gag
his blood smells
even worse than he does
jesus
and its all over the place
but the creep himself hes gone
were out of time
the sirens  i used to welcome the sound
theres nothing to do now
but find a place to hole up for the night
get nancy calmed down and figure out
what on earth im going to do next
the stink  somehow it stays with us
all the way to the motel
nancy i went to your apartment
your window was thrown wide open
the rooms looked almost empty
thats why i was sure
youd been kidnapped
my window robbed again
thats the third time this year
i swore if i ever saw you again
id show you i grew up strong
but there i was just like before
scared and helpless
im such an asshole
you should sit down
youll feel a little bit better if you sit down
ive never been all that good with people
when it comes to reassuring
a traumatized 19yearold
im as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench
its always been you hartigan
all these years
its just nerves
making you say that nancy
youre just exhausted
you need to sleep
sleep with me
stop it nancy
eight years
why do you think
i kept writing you those letters
it wasnt just gratitude
i tried to fall in love with boys
even thought i did once or twice
but i was already in love with you
thats enough
jesus christ
im old enough to be your grandfather
youre just scared
im not scared
no
theres wrong and theres wrong
and then theres this
for gods sakes youre just a kid
i love you
i love you too
with all my heart
cold shower it helps
no nancy
recognize my voice hartigan
recognize my voice
you piece of shit cop
i look different
but i bet you can recognize my voice

i recognize your voice junior
everythings gone straight to hell
ive been suckered
into betraying the only friend ive got
and put her in the hands of a murdering
rapist i thought id put down for good
suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator
its all gone to hell
klump its me
i got a dead man needs to be fetched
i want you to set me up for a party
ive already got the girl you dumb shit
hey it better be perfect
or im calling my dad
my tools better be clean and sharp
it better be ready
it better be perfect
i get to do whatever i want
however i want whenever i want it
my dad  id love him if i didnt hate him
he spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet
to grow back that equipment
you blew off from between my legs
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid
although as you can see
there were some side effects
im not complaining though
since youve been gone
ive been having the time of my life
and now youve led me back
to your darling cordelia
we all wondered
who wrote all those letters
she left not a clue
clever girl
and so pretty so pretty
a little old for my taste
but i can forgive that just this once
nancy dont scream
whatever he does to you dont scream
shell scream im gonna take
all night doing dear old nancy
and youre gonna die knowing
that its all your fault
theyve all screamed hartigan
dozens of them  maybe a hundred
eight years worth
every one of them has screamed
and if there werent
so many people hereabout
i would show you how
im gonna make dear old nancy scream
its gonna be one hell of a show
this is it
no way to fight it now
no hope left
no chance
this is it
this is the end
no
give it a shot old man
keep your neck tight move
the window  maybe theres an alarm
keep your neck tight goddamn it
stay conscious
stay conscious
no alarm
the glass cut the rope
you can do it
it is inclement upon me
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness
in selecting such an eyecatching
and impractical car to heist mr shlubb
irrelevant to said mission is the following
query which i now put forth to you
wherein this most streamlined
and trunkless of transports
bonerinspiring though it may be
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo
i can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm
tell me where roark takes the girls
or ill cut your damn head off
in plain english creep
the answer you seek is rural
even agrarian
the farm
thats all i need to hear
every cop on the force
knows about the roark familys farm
and to stay away from it
shlubb and klump
were packing an arsenal
once things get loud
ill probably have use for the cannons
but at first ill have to play it quiet
quiet and nasty
nancys car six miles from the farm
nobody but me can keep
this heap running  she told me
good girl
the car stalled out on that yellow bastard
and you didnt tell him
how to start it up again
you kept your mouth shut
ill bet junior was furious
ill bet he slapped you around
something fierce
but you stayed strong
you bought a few extra minutes
theres still a chance nancy
dont scream
i ditch the car a mile or so from the farm
and make my way through the woods
im not halfway there when it hits
my heart
cant be my heart
i was cured
bad cough  blood in it
doesnt matter now
i dont have to stay alive
that much longer anyway
rotten way to kill a man but its quiet
hate yourself later
youre only making this worse for yourself
you stupid cow
do you think im tired
is that it
do you think im getting tired
youre the one whos gonna crack
youll crack
youll cry and beg
youll scream
oh yeah youll scream
you big fat ugly cow
youre thinking the whip
was the worst i could do
that was foreplay
hartigan was right about you
you cant get it up unless i scream
youre pathetic
youre pathetic
its not wise at all
to make fun of me like that
it brings out the worst in me
stupid old man
in too much of a hurry
damn
it cant be
charging in like galahad
just like i told myself i wouldnt
stupid old man
you tagged him good
dont take no chances perforate the fool
good advice
give it up junior
its over
let her go
youre dreaming hartigan
i get to see your eyes while i fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you
look at you
youre about to keel over
you cant even lift that cannon
sure i can
you gave me a scare there
for a second there old man
nancy im sorry
im taking no chances with you
first i soften you up
and then its showtime
here it comes
its gonna hurt
youre right about that
sucker
i take away his weapon
both of them
eight long years son of a bitch
after a while all im doing is pounding
wet chunks of bone into the floorboards
so i stop
so long junior
been a pleasure
i didnt scream hartigan not once
i didnt scream
i know it baby
you grew up strong
by the time i get her to the car
nancy stops shaking
her skin is warm again
shes herself again
thanks for remembering my coat
and for all the little things
like saving my life twice
you better get rolling
youre not coming along
no i have friends on their way
to collect evidence
im gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open
im gonna clear my name
im gonna put senator roark
behind bars where he belongs
i cant lose you not again
youll never lose me nancy
nancy callahan the love of my life
shame to lie to her
i hope she forgives me for it
get senator roark behind bars
sure
and maybe after ive pulled off
that miracle ill go and punch out god
there isnt a prosecutor in the state
wholl go after senator roark
i killed his only son
the bloodline is cut
roarks lost his goddamn legacy
hell use all his power
to get revenge on me
hell go after me through nancy
hell find her again
therell be no end to it
shell never be safe
not as long as im alive
theres only one way to beat him
an old man dies
a young woman lives
fair trade
i love you nancy
yes
oh mom dont go on like that
its not the city i couldve gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere
yeah just a fracture
the doctor said its a clean break
it should be right as rain in no time
turn the right corner in sin city
