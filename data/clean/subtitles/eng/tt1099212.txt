okay  i think i m warm enough now 
 gasps 
your hand is so cold 
bella  whoa 
what is going on 
my dad s still here 
can you pull in 
edward  that s my father s car on the end 
what is he doing here 
edward  carlisle  what s going on 
waylon forge was found in a boat
out near his place 
  i just examined the body 
  he died 
  how 
  animal attack 
was it the same one that
got that security guard down in mason 
most likely 
  well  it s getting closer to town  then 
  bella  you should go inside 
waylon was your father s friend 
okay 
i ll see you later 
 man chattering on police radio 
  hey 
  hey 
dad  i m really sorry 
i ve known him going on 30 years 
don t worry  we re gonna find this thing 
meantime 
i want you to carry this with you 
  i don t know if you   
  it ll give your old man some peace of mind 
okay 
let s go home 
cold one 
 echoing boom 
 breath trembling 
you re impossibly fast and strong 
your skin is pale white and ice cold 
your eyes change color 
and sometimes you speak
like you re from a different time 
you never eat or drink anything 
you don t go out in the sunlight 
 bella gasps quietly 
how old are you 
seventeen 
how long have you been 17 
a while 
i know what you are 
say it 
out loud 
say it 
vampire 
are you afraid 
 breath trembling 
no 
then ask me the most basic question 
what do we eat 
you won t hurt me 
where are we going 
up the mountain 
out of the cloud bank 
you need to see what
i look like in the sunlight 
 bella panting 
this is why we don t show
ourselves in sunlight 
people would know we re different 
this is what i am 
 gasping 
it s like diamonds 
you re beautiful 
beautiful 
this is the skin of a killer  bella 
i m a killer 
i don t believe that 
that s because you believe the lie 
it s camouflage 
i m the world s most dangerous predator 
everything about me invites you in 
my voice  my face  even my smell 
as if i would need any of that 
 loud whoosh 
as if you could outrun me 
 whooshing 
as if you could fight me off 
i m designed to kill 
i don t care 
i ve killed people before 
it does not matter 
i wanted to kill you 
i ve never wanted a human s blood
so much in my life 
i trust you 
don t 
i m here  i trust you 
 whoosh 
my family 
we re different from others of our kind 
we only hunt animals 
we ve learned to control our thirst 
but it s you  your scent 
it s like a drug to me 
you re like
my own personal brand of heroin 
 whoosh 
why did you hate me
so much when we met 
i did 
only for making me want you so badly 
i still don t know if i can control myself 
i know you can 
i can t read your mind 
you have to tell me what you re thinking 
now i m afraid 
good 
i m not afraid of you 
i m only afraid of losing you 
i feel like you re gonna disappear 
you don t know how long
i ve waited for you 
so the lion fell in love with the lamb 
what a stupid lamb 
what a sick  masochistic lion 
 gentle theme playing 
bella  about three things
i was absolutely positive 
first 
edward was a vampire 
second 
there was a part of him 
and i didn t know
how dominant that part might be 
 horn honks twice 
that thirsted for my blood 
and third 
i was unconditionally and irrevocably
in love with him 
jessica  monte carlo 
that s our prom theme 
gambling  tuxedos  and bond  james bond 
 engine purrs 
oh  my god 
 up tempo rock theme playing 
wow 
 clears throat 
you know  everybody s staring 
not that guy  no  he just looked 
i m breaking all the rules now anyway 
since i m going to hell 
so  does a person have to be dying
to become like you 
no  that s just carlisle 
he d never do this to someone
who had another choice 
so  how long have you been like this 
since 1918 
that s when carlisle found me
dying of spanish influenza 
bella  what was it like 
 yells 
edward  the venom was excruciating 
but what carlisle did was much harder 
not many of us have the restraint to do that 
but didn t he just have to bite 
not exactly 
when we taste
human blood  a sort of frenzy begins 
and it s almost impossible to stop 
bella  but carlisle did 
edward  first with me
and then with his wife  esme 
so is carlisle the real reason
that you don t kill people 
no  he s not the only reason 
i don t want to be a monster 
my family 
we think of ourselves as vegetarians  right 
 cause we only survive
on the blood of animals 
but it s   
it s like a human only living on tofu 
it keeps you strong 
but you re never fully satisfied 
it wouldn t be like drinking your blood 
for instance 
was it other vampires that killed waylon 
yeah 
there are others out there 
and we run into them from time to time 
can the rest of your family
read people s minds like you can 
no  that s just me 
but alice can see the future 
i bet she saw me coming 
alice s visions are subjective 
i mean  the future can always change 
 loud bang 
could you act human 
i mean  i ve got neighbors 
i m gonna take you to my place tomorrow 
thanks 
  wait  like  with your family 
  yeah 
what if they don t like me 
so  you re worried not because
you ll be in a house full of vampires 
but because you think
they won t approve of you 
i m glad i amuse you 
what is it 
complication 
i ll pick you up tomorrow 
hey  come to visit your truck 
looks good  got that dent out 
  yeah 
  actually  we came to visit your flat screen 
first mariners game of the season 
plus jacob here keeps bugging me about

charlie  vitamin r 
well done  chief 
harry clearwater s homemade fish fry 
good man 
any luck with that waylon case 
well  i don t think it was an animal
that killed him 
never thought it was 
so spread the word out at the rez  huh 
keep the kids out of the woods 
will do 
don t want no one else getting hurt  do we 
 slow  exotic theme playing 
 exhales 
whoa

it s so light and open  you know 
what did you expect 
coffins and dungeons and moats 
 chuckles  no  not the moats 
not the moats 
this is the one place we don t have to hide 
 operatic music playing in distance 
i told them not to do this 
man on tv  you add a little bit of olive oil

 speaking italian 
you ve given us an excuse
to use the kitchen for the first time 
i hope you re hungry 
  yeah  absolutely 
  she already ate 
perfect 
yeah  it s just because
i know that you guys don t eat   
of course  it s very considerate of you 
  just ignore rosalie  i do 
  rosalie  yeah 
let s just keep pretending
like this isn t dangerous for all of us 
i would never tell anybody anything 
she knows that 
yeah  well  the problem is 
you two have gone public now  so   
emmett 
no  she should know 
the entire family
will be implicated if this ends badly 
badly  as in   
i would become the meal 
 snickering 
 laughing

i m afraid your hunting activities
have caused something of a mess for us 
our apologies 
we didn t realize the territory
had been claimed 
yes  well  we maintain
a permanent residence nearby 
really 
well  we won t be a problem anymore 
we were just passing through 
the humans were tracking us 
but we led them east 
you should be safe 
excellent 
so 
could you use three more players 
come on  just one game 
sure  why not 
a few of us were leaving 
you could take their place 
we ll bat first 
i m the one with the wicked curveball 
well  i think we can handle that 
we shall see 
 ominous theme plays 
 wind whistling softly 
 sniffing 
you brought a snack 
 snarling 
laurent  a human 
carlisle  the girl is with us 
i think it best if you leave 
i can see the game is over 
we ll go now 
james 
carlisle  get bella out of here 
go 
okay  i ve got it  i ve got it  i m all right 
what  now he s coming after me 
listen to me  james is a tracker 
the hunt is his obsession 
i read his mind 
my reaction on the field set him off 
i just made this his most exciting game ever 
  he s never gonna stop 
  what should we do 
we have to kill him 
rip him apart and burn the pieces 
  where we going 
  away from forks 
  we ll get a ferry to vancouver 
  i have to go home  now 
  you have to take me home 
  you can t go home 
he s just gonna trace your scent there 
it s the first place he s gonna look 
  but my dad is there  we   
  it doesn t matter 
yes  it does 
he could get killed because of us 
just let me get you out of here first 
all right 
it s my dad  we have to go back 
we ll figure a way
to lead the tracker away somehow 
i don t know  but we have to do something 
 sports playing on tv 
  edward  i said leave me alone 
  bella  don t do this  please 
it s over  get out 
hey  hey  hey  hey

charlie  your mom s not even in phoenix 
bella  she ll come home 
i ll call her from the road 
you re not gonna drive home right now 
you can sleep on it 
if you still feel like going in the morning 
  i ll take you to the airport 
  no  i want to drive 
it ll give me more time to think 
i mean  if i get really tired 
i ll pull into a motel  i promise 
look  bella  i know i m not
that much fun to be around 
but i can change that 
we can do more stuff together 
like what 
like watch baseball on the flat screen 
eat at the diner every night 
steak and cobbler 
dad  that s you  that s not me 
bella  come on  i just   
i just got you back 
yeah  and  you know  if i don t get out now 
then i m just gonna be stuck here like mom 
 door slams 
your father s gonna forgive you 
why don t you let me drive 
he won t 
you should ve seen his face 
i told him the same thing
that my mom told him
when she was leaving him 
it s the only way he d let you go 
just don t worry about him now 
he s safe  the tracker s following us 
 loud bang 
 gasps 
  oh  god 
  it s just emmett 
alice is in the car behind us 
 melancholy theme playing 
carlisle  wait 
he came to warn us about james 
this isn t my fight 
and i ve grown tired of his games 
but he s got unparalleled senses 
absolutely lethal 
i ve never seen anything like him
in my 300 years 
and the woman  victoria 
don t underestimate her 
i ve had to fight our kind before 
  they re not easy to kill 
  emmett  but not impossible 
we ll tear them apart and burn the pieces 
i don t relish the thought
of killing another creature 
even a sadistic one like james 
  what if he kills one of us first 
  i m gonna run bella south 
can you lead the tracker away from here 
no  edward 
james knows you would never leave bella 
  he ll follow you 
  alice  i ll go with bella 
jasper and i will drive her south 
i ll keep her safe  edward 
  can you keep your thoughts to yourself 
  yes 
rosalie  esme 
could you put these on
so the tracker will pick up bella s scent 
why  what is she to me 
rosalie  bella is with edward 
she s part of this family now 
and we protect our family 
oh  god  if anything   
what if   
if anything happens  i swear to god   
nothing s gonna happen 
there s seven of us 
and there s two of them 
and when everything s done 
i m gonna come back and get you 
yeah 
bella  you are my life now 
 engines starting 
hey  mom  it s me again 
you must have let your phone die
or something 
i m not in forks  but everything s okay 
and i ll explain it later 
edward  rosalie  mark the tree 
that s good 
 growls 
 inhales deeply 
 gasps 
what is it  what do you see 
 low rumbling 
 fierce growling 
he s figured it out 
the tracker  he just changed course 
  where will it take him  alice 
  mirrors 
a room full of mirrors 
edward said the visions
weren t always certain 
jasper  she sees the course people
are on while they re on it 
if they change their minds 
the vision changes 
okay  so the course that
the tracker s on now
is gonna lead him to a ballet studio 
  you ve been here 
  i took lessons as a kid 
the school i went to
had an arch just like that 
was your school here in phoenix 
yeah 
 phone vibrates 
  edward  are you okay 
  we ve lost the tracker 
the woman s still in the area 
rosalie and esme are going back
to forks to protect your father 
i m coming to get you  then you and i
are gonna go somewhere alone 
and the others will keep hunting 
i ll do whatever it takes
to make you safe again 
 phone vibrating 
hey  mom  i m glad you got my message 
what are you doing home 
bella  bella  bella  where are you 
  calm down  everything s fine 
  bella  bella 
i ll explain everything later 
mom  are you there 
james  forks high school doesn t protect
its students  privacy very well 
it was just too easy for victoria
to find your previous address 
it s a nice house you have here 
i was prepared to wait for you 
but then mom came home after she received
a very worried call from your dad 
and it all worked out quite well 
renee  wait  wait   
don t touch her  don t   
  you can still save her 
  bella  don t 
but you re gonna have to get away
from your friends 
  can you handle that 
  where should i meet you 
how about your old ballet studio 
and i ll know if you bring anyone along 
poor mommy would
pay the price for that mistake 
bella  i d never given much thought
to how i would die 
but dying in the place of someone i love
seems like a good way to go 
i can t bring myself to regret the decisions
that brought me face to face with death 
they also brought me to edward 
renee  bella  bella  bella  where are you 
  mom 
  bella 
  mom 
  there you are 
renee  what are you doing in here 
young bella  everyone makes fun of me 
come on  you re a wonderful dancer 
mom  i suck 
 james laughing 
you do not suck 
that s my favorite part 
you were a stubborn child  weren t you 
  she s not even here 
  no 
james  sorry 
you know  but you really made it too easy 
so to make things more entertaining 
i m gonna make a little film
of our time together 
i borrowed this from your house 
i hope you don t mind 
good 
and
action 
that ll break edward s little heart 
you have   
edward has nothing to do with this 
but he does 
his rage will make for more interesting sport
than his feeble attempt to protect you 
and let s continue 
 growls 
 whooshing 
 bella yells 
 grunting 
 groans 
beautiful  very visually dynamic 
i chose my stage well 
it s too bad he didn t have

alice said that she saw me like you

  her visions change

bella  no one will surrender tonight 
but i won t give in 
i know what i want 
have i found you
flightless bird
grounded
bleeding or lost you
american mouth
 singing  how come i end up where i started
how come i end up where i went wrong
won t take my eyes off the ball again
you reel me out then you cut the string
how come i end up where i started
how come i end up where i went wrong
won t take my eyes off the ball again
first you reel me out
and then you cut the string
you used to be all right
what happened 
did the cat get your tongue
did your string come undone
one by one
one by one
it comes to us all
it s as soft as your pillow
 singing  i dreamed i was missing
you were so scared
but no one would listen
 cause no one else cared
after my dreaming
i woke with this fear
what am i leaving
when i m done here 
so if you re asking me
i want you to know
when my time comes
forget the wrong that i ve done
help me leave behind some
reasons to be missed
don t resent me
and when you re feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
forgetting all the hurt inside
you ve learned to hide so well
pretending someone else can come
and save me from myself
i can t be who you are
when my time comes
forget the wrong that i ve done
help me leave behind some
reasons to be missed
don t resent me
and when you re feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
forgetting all the hurt inside
you ve learned to hide so well
pretending someone else can come
and save me from myself
i can t be who you are
i can t be who you are
 singing  how can i decide what s right
when you re clouding up my mind
i can t win your losing fight
all the time
how can i ever own what s mine
when you re always taking sides
but you won t take away my pride
no  not this time
no  not this time
how did we get here 
when i used to know you so well
but how did we get here 
i think i know
the truth is hiding in your eyes
and its hanging on your tongue
just boiling in my blood
but you think that i can t see
what kind of man that you are
if you re a man at all
well  i will figure this one out on my own
i m screaming i love you so
my thoughts you can t decode
how did we get here 
when i used to know you so well
yeah
but how did we get here 
well  i think i know how
do you see what we ve done
we re gonna make such fools of ourselves
how did we get here 
when i used to know you so well
yeah  yeah  yeah
how did we get here
