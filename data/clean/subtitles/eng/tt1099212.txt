man chattering on police radio
hey

dad im really sorry
ive known him going on 30 years
dont worry were gonna find this thing
meantime
i want you to carry this with you
i dont know if you
itll give your old man some peace of mind
okay
lets go home
cold one
echoing boom
breath trembling
youre impossibly fast and strong
your skin is pale white and icecold
your eyes change color
and sometimes you speak
like youre from a different time
you never eat or drink anything
you dont go out in the sunlight
bella gasps quietly
how old are you
seventeen
how long have you been 17
a while
i know what you are
say it
out loud
say it
vampire
are you afraid
breath trembling
no
then ask me the most basic question
what do we eat
you wont hurt me
where are we going
up the mountain
out of the cloud bank
you need to see what
i look like in the sunlight
bella panting
this is why we dont show
ourselves in sunlight
people would know were different
this is what i am
gasping
its like diamonds
youre beautiful
beautiful
this is the skin of a killer bella
im a killer
i dont believe that
thats because you believe the lie
its camouflage
im the worlds most dangerous predator
everything about me invites you in
my voice my face even my smell
as if i would need any of that
loud whoosh
as if you could outrun me
whooshing
as if you could fight me off
im designed to kill
i dont care
ive killed people before
it does not matter
i wanted to kill you
ive never wanted a humans blood
so much in my life
i trust you
dont
im here i trust you
whoosh
my family
were different from others of our kind
we only hunt animals
weve learned to control our thirst
but its you your scent
its like a drug to me
youre like
my own personal brand of heroin
whoosh
why did you hate me
so much when we met
i did
only for making me want you so badly
i still dont know if i can control myself
i know you can
i cant read your mind
you have to tell me what youre thinking
now im afraid
good
im not afraid of you
im only afraid of losing you
i feel like youre gonna disappear
you dont know how long
ive waited for you
so the lion fell in love with the lamb
what a stupid lamb
what a sick masochistic lion
gentle theme playing
bella about three things
i was absolutely positive
first
edward was a vampire
second
there was a part of him
and i didnt know
how dominant that part might be
horn honks twice
that thirsted for my blood
and third
i was unconditionally and irrevocably
in love with him
jessica monte carlo
thats our prom theme
gambling tuxedos and bond james bond
engine purrs
oh my god
uptempo rock theme playing
wow
clears throat
you know everybodys staring
not that guy no he just looked
im breaking all the rules now anyway
since im going to hell
so does a person have to be dying
to become like you
no thats just carlisle
hed never do this to someone
who had another choice
so how long have you been like this
since 1918
thats when carlisle found me
dying of spanish influenza
bella what was it like
yells
edward the venom was excruciating
but what carlisle did was much harder
not many of us have the restraint to do that
but didnt he just have to bite
not exactly
when we taste
human blood a sort of frenzy begins
and its almost impossible to stop
bella but carlisle did
edward first with me
and then with his wife esme
so is carlisle the real reason
that you dont kill people
no hes not the only reason
i dont want to be a monster
my family
we think of ourselves as vegetarians right
cause we only survive
on the blood of animals
but its
its like a human only living on tofu
it keeps you strong
but youre never fully satisfied
it wouldnt be like drinking your blood
for instance
was it other vampires that killed waylon
yeah
there are others out there
and we run into them from time to time
can the rest of your family
read peoples minds like you can
no thats just me
but alice can see the future
i bet she saw me coming
alices visions are subjective
i mean the future can always change
loud bang
could you act human
i mean ive got neighbors
im gonna take you to my place tomorrow
thanks
wait like with your family
yeah
what if they dont like me
so youre worried not because
youll be in a house full of vampires
but because you think
they wont approve of you
im glad i amuse you
what is it
complication
ill pick you up tomorrow
hey come to visit your truck
looks good got that dent out
yeah
actually we came to visit your flatscreen
first mariners game of the season
plus jacob here keeps bugging me about
seeing you again
great dad thanks
just keeping it real son
charlie vitamin r
well done chief
harry clearwaters homemade fish fry
good man
any luck with that waylon case
well i dont think it was an animal
that killed him
never thought it was
so spread the word out at the rez huh
keep the kids out of the woods
will do
dont want no one else getting hurt do we
slow exotic theme playing
exhales
whoa
this is incredible
its so light and open you know
what did you expect
coffins and dungeons and moats
chuckles no not the moats
not the moats
this is the one place we dont have to hide
operatic music playing in distance
i told them not to do this
man on tv you add a little bit of olive oil
to a nonstick sauté pan
and you want to cook
with the olive oil in mediumhigh heat
what i do i cut this in strips
and then we gonna cut this
is she even italian
her name is bella
im sure shell love it no matter what
rosalie sighs get a whiff of that
singsong here comes the human
bella were making italiano for you
bella this is esme
my mother for all intents and purposes
speaking italian
youve given us an excuse
to use the kitchen for the first time
i hope youre hungry
yeah absolutely
she already ate
perfect
yeah its just because
i know that you guys dont eat
of course its very considerate of you
just ignore rosalie i do
rosalie yeah
lets just keep pretending
like this isnt dangerous for all of us
i would never tell anybody anything
she knows that
yeah well the problem is
you two have gone public now so
emmett
no she should know

a very worried call from your dad
and it all worked out quite well
renee wait wait

from your friends
can you handle that
where should i meet you
how about your old ballet studio
and ill know if you bring anyone along
poor mommy would
pay the price for that mistake
bella id never given much thought
to how i would die
but dying in the place of someone i love
seems like a good way to go
i cant bring myself to regret the decisions
that brought me facetoface with death
they also brought me to edward
renee bella bella bella where are you

i borrowed this from your house
i hope you dont mind

and
action
thatll break edwards little heart

edward has nothing to do with this

his rage will make for more interesting sport
than his feeble attempt to protect you
and lets continue
growls
whooshing
bella yells
grunting
groans

how come i end up where i went wrong
wont take my eyes off the ball again
you reel me out then you cut the string
how come i end up where i started
how come i end up where i went wrong
wont take my eyes off the ball again
first you reel me out
and then you cut the string
you used to be all right
what happened
did the cat get your tongue
did your string come undone
one by one
one by one
it comes to us all
its as soft as your pillow
singing i dreamed i was missing
you were so scared
but no one would listen
cause no one else cared
after my dreaming
i woke with this fear
what am i leaving
when im done here
so if youre asking me
i want you to know
when my time comes
forget the wrong that ive done
help me leave behind some
reasons to be missed
dont resent me
and when youre feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
forgetting all the hurt inside
youve learned to hide so well
pretending someone else can come
and save me from myself
i cant be who you are
when my time comes
forget the wrong that ive done
help me leave behind some
reasons to be missed
dont resent me
and when youre feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
forgetting all the hurt inside
youve learned to hide so well
pretending someone else can come
and save me from myself
i cant be who you are
i cant be who you are
singing how can i decide whats right
when youre clouding up my mind
i cant win your losing fight
all the time
how can i ever own whats mine
when youre always taking sides
but you wont take away my pride
no not this time
no not this time
how did we get here
when i used to know you so well
but how did we get here
i think i know
the truth is hiding in your eyes
and its hanging on your tongue
just boiling in my blood
but you think that i cant see
what kind of man that you are
if youre a man at all
well i will figure this one out on my own
im screaming i love you so
my thoughts you cant decode
how did we get here
when i used to know you so well
yeah
but how did we get here
well i think i know how
do you see what weve done
were gonna make such fools of ourselves
how did we get here
when i used to know you so well
yeah yeah yeah
how did we get here
