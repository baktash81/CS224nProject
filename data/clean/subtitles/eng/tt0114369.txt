both barrels 
a crime of passion 
yeah 
just look at all the passion
on that wall 
this is a done deal 
all but the paperwork 
did the kid see it 
what 
the kid 
what kind of question s that 
we ll be glad to
get rid of you  somerset 
always these questions 
 did the kid see it  
who gives a fuck 
he s dead 
his wife killed him 
the rest is nothing to do with us 
detective somerset 
i m detective mills 
i get in town 20 minutes ago 
they dump me here 
look   
mills 
let s find a bar 
sit and talk   
i d like to get to the precinct 
not much time for
this transition thing 
i had a question 
when we spoke on the phone 
yeah 
  why here 
  i don t follow 
all this effort
to get transferred 
it s the first question
that popped into my head 
same reasons as you 
or the reasons you had
before you decided to quit 
you just met me 
maybe i don t understand
the question 
it s very simple 
you actually fought
to get reassigned here 
  i never saw it done that way 
  thought i d do some good 
be great if we didn t start out
kicking each other in the balls 
  you re calling the shots 
  yes 
i want you to look
and listen  okay 
i wasn t guarding a taco bell 
i worked homicide 5 years 
  not here 
  i understand 
over the next 7 days 
do me a favor and remember that 
yeah  okay 
say it again 
i thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls 
serpico s got to go 
you might want to get rid of   
this crusty  this eye  serpico 
  did you get it 
  got it 
good 
coffee  no 
nothing s been touched 
it s all like i found it 
what time was death established 
like i said 
i didn t touch anything 
but he s had his face
in spaghetti for 45 minutes 
no one bothers with vital signs 
did i stutter 
he ain t breathing unless
he s breathing spaghetti sauce 
  that s how it s done around here 
  i beg your pardon  detective 
but the guy s sitting in a pile
of his own piss and shit 
if he wasn t dead 
he would have stood up by now 
  alright 
  thank you  officer 
thank you 
i wonder   
what was the point
of that conversation 
i don t know 
how many times barney five found
dead bodies that weren t dead 
drop it 
phone guinness 
i think we got a record here 
better homes and gardens 
who said this was murder 
no one 
guy s heart must be
the size of a canned ham 
if this isn t a coronary 
well 
i don t know 
whoops 
how about that 
we had this case once 
guy dead on the ground 
knife in his back 
murder  right 
fuck 
big insurance policy involved 
guy took the tip of the blade 
stuck it in
his own shoulder blades 
he must have screwed up
because there were   
   multiples back there 
  please be quiet 
wait a minute 
what 
we got a bucket here 
what s in it 
my god 
fucking vomit 
any blood in it 
i didn t see any 
help yourself 
are you thinking it s poison 
oh  wonderful  very moody 
think it s poison  somerset 
you girls have got
forensics waiting outside 
we might not fit 
there s room 
light s the problem 
how are you 
detective mills 
go help the officers
question the neighbors 
what 
and send in forensics 
he s dead 
thank you  doctor 
you saw my files 
the things i ve done 
nope 
i did door to doors 
walked the beat  all that shit   
a long time 
  and 
  my badge says   
 detective   same as yours 
look  i made a decision 
i had to consider
the integrity of the crime scene 
not whether you were getting
enough time in the field 
hey  man   
just don t jerk me off 
that s all i ask 
he s been dead   
a long time 
and not from poison 
oh  man 
how can you
let yourself go like this 
it took four orderlies
just to get him on the table 
how d the fat fuck
fit out his door 
it s obvious he was a shut in 
see how big this stomach is 
strange thing is  it stretches 
look  the size of the
cardiac orifice  where the food   
i see that 
but it means nothing to me 
he s got lines of distention
across the duodenum 
the interior wall s ripped open 
this man ate till he burst 
no  he didn t burst all the way 
he was hemorrhaging internally 
there was a hematoma
in the rectus and   
   the abdominal muscles 
  he did die by eating 
yes and no 
what about these bruises here 
i haven t figured that out yet 
gun pressed against his head 
pressed hard enough 
fuck  yeah 
on the front 
flush with the muzzle 
ladies and gentlemen 
we have a homicide 
killer put a bucket under him 
took his time  too 
coroner said
it could ve lasted 12 hours 
victim s throat was swollen 
probably from the effort 
and there was a point
when he passed out 
that s when the killer kicked him 
   and he burst 
  sadistic fucker 
when you want somebody dead 
you drive by and shoot 
you don t risk
the time it takes for this 
unless the act itself
has meaning 
somebody had a problem with
a fat boy and tortured him  simple 
in the grocer bags 
we found two receipts 
so the killer went back   
to the supermarket 
so 
it s his thing 
i ve been out in the rain 
  this is a beginning 
  we ve got   
one dead guy  not three 
no motive 
don t start
that big brain of yours   
cooking on this  alright 
i d like to be reassigned 
whoa 
what are you talking about 
this can t be my last duty 
it ll go on and on 
you re retiring in 6 days 
you ve left
unfinished business before 
the cases were taken
as close as possible to conclusion 
  may i speak freely 
  we re friends here 
it shouldn t be his first case 
i knew it  it s not
my first assignment  you dick 
it s too soon for him 
you can say that shit
to my face  captain 
it s too soon for you 
captain 
can we talk in private 
this is a personal thing   
just shut up  mills 
i don t have anyone else
to put on this 
this is metro 
  you don t just get to swap 
  give it to me 
what 
he wants out  fuck him 
see you  have a nice time 
give it to me 
i ll put you on something else 
go on  mills  just go on 
i m sorry  old buddy 
but it looks like you re stuck
cleaning up the fat man 
quiet down 
alright  calm down  calm down 
quiet down 
here s how it ll work 
i ll answer questions
for 10 minutes only 
ask those questions in a calm 
orderly fashion  or i will leave 
detective 
  can i have a moment 
  no 
i won t discuss the details
of this investigation 
so don t bother asking 
  what you got for me 
  nothing yet  boss 
why don t you guys
go get a coffee 
we have this breaking story 
let s go downtown  where attorney 
eli gould 
was found murdered today 
da martin talbot is taking
questions from reporters 
that s ridiculous and offensive 
there is no conflict 
and any claim there could be
is irresponsible 
now hold on 
i just met with
law enforcement officials 
and they have
their very best men on this 
this will be the definition
of swift justice 
pardon me  george 
  somerset   
  come in 
you heard the news 
nope  haven t heard 
eli gould was found murdered
this morning 
someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death 
wrote the word  greed 
on the floor 
  greed 
  yeah  in blood 
mills is heading the investigation 
excuse me 
don t do that  please 
good for him 
what will you do   
with yourself out there  somerset 
i ll work maybe on a farm 
fix my house 
don t you feel it 
don t you feel that feeling 
you won t be a cop anymore 
that s the whole idea 
i don t think you ll leave 
you can t leave all this 
guy s out walking his dog 
gets attacked 
his watch is taken  his wallet 
and while he s lying on
the sidewalk 
helpless 
his attacker stabs him
in both eyes 
this happened last night 
four blocks from here 
i read about it 
i don t understand anymore 
it s the way it s always been 
  maybe you re right 
  you were made for this work 
you can t deny that 
maybe i m wrong 
coroner sent this for you 
found them in
the fat boy s stomach 
mixed in with the food 
looks like little pieces   
   of plastic 
  set them on that desk 
they were   
fed to him 
lord 
this was found behind the fridge
in the obesity murder scene 
 long is the way 
and hard  that out of hell
leads up to the light  
it s from milton 
 paradise lost 
alright 
i m confused 
it means that
this is a beginning 
this was behind the fridge 
written in grease 
there are 7 deadly sins  captain 
gluttony 
greed 
sloth  wrath 
pride  lust 
and envy 
seven 
hold on 
this is not even my desk 
you can expect 5 more of these 
wait a minute 
i can t get involved in this 
somerset 
he wanted it 
damn 
i m all over it

i knew he was   
   the guy i d marry 
  really 
he was the funniest guy
i d ever met 
really 
it s kind of rare nowadays 
i mean  that level   
of commitment 
don t worry 
i won t wear it to the table 
you know 
no matter how often i see guns 
i can t get used to them 
same here 
  why aren t you married  william 
  tracy   
what the hell    
i was close once 
it just didn t happen 
it surprises me 
it really does 
well   
anyone who spends much time
with me finds me disagreeable 
just ask your husband 
very true 
very  very true 
how long have you lived here 
too long 
how do you like it 
you know 
takes time  settle in 
it ll be good 
you get numb after a while 
there are things to any city 
subway 
it ll go away in a minute 
real estate guy 
fucking piece of    sorry honey 
shows us the place a few times 
i think he s good 
he s efficient 
trace really likes it 
then we wonder why he only
brings us here for 5 minutes 
we found out the first night 
the soothing  relaxing   
vibrating home 
i m sorry 
yeah  alright  laugh it up 
i don t know why you re laughing 
alright  already 
he had to get into the building
before the office closed 
  gould would ve been working late 
  i m certain 
the biggest defense lawyer
in town  infamous  really 
the body was found
on tuesday morning 
the office was closed monday 
he could ve gotten in friday 
laid low till the cleaners left 
then had his way
with gould saturday  sunday 
maybe monday 
look 
gould was bound  right arm free 
he was handed a butcher s knife 
  check out the scale 
  a pound of flesh 
 one pound of flesh 
no more  no less 
no cartilage 
no bone 
only flesh  
 merchant of venice 
didn t see it 
 this task done 
and he would go free  
that chair was   
   soaked with sweat 
  of course 
the killer wanted gould
to take his time 
deciding which cut
to make first 
imagine it 
there s a gun in your face 
which part of your body
is expendable 
the love handle 
cut along the side
of his own stomach 
let s take a fresh look 
the corpse is there  but   
iook through it 
edit out your initial shock 
the trick is to find
one item  one detail   
and focus on it   
till it s an exhausted possibility 
i ll get another beer  beer 
wine  please 
he s preaching 
punishing 
the sins were used
in medieval sermons 
7 cardinal virtues  7 deadly sins 
   used as teaching tools 
  yeah  like in   
   the parson s tale  and dante 
  you read them 
yeah 
parts 
remember in  purgatory 
dante and his buddy
climb up   
the hill and check out
the sinners 
the 7 terraces of purgation 
yeah  right 
but there  pride comes first 
not gluttony 
let s consider the books
as the killer s inspiration 
the sermons were about
atonement for sin 
these murders are like
forced attrition 
forced what 
attrition s when you
regret your sins   
   but not for love of god 
  because of a gun in your face 
no fingerprints 
no 
totally unrelated victims 
and no witnesses 
which i don t get   
because the fucker
had to get back out 
in a major city 
minding your business is a science 
in rape prevention  they tell you
never to cry for help 
always yell  fire  
nobody answers  help  
holler  fire   they ll come 
that s fucked up 
he must have left
another puzzle piece 
thanks for talking this out 
but i got to sleep 
i got to walk the dogs 
this is just to satisfy
my curiosity 
  i m leaving the end of the week 
  shit  no  wait 
gould s wife was out of town 
  so this means she saw something 
  what if it s a threat 
i put her in a safehouse 
she wasn t happy about it 
what if it isn t
what she s seen 
but what she s supposed to
and hasn t yet 
yeah  okay  what 
i don t know 
but that s the one thing 
i ll sign us in 
gotta see mrs  gould 
mrs  gould 
mrs  gould  i m sorry 
i truly am 
i don t understand 
i need you to look at each photo
very carefully 
see if anything s strange 
out of place  anything at all 
i don t see anything 
you re sure 
please 
i can t do this right now 
okay 
it s got to be now 
maybe we missed something 
wait 
what 
here 
this painting  it s upside down 
  your men didn t move this 
  no 
those shots were taken
before forensics 
nothing 
there s got to be something 
he moved the screws
to re hang it 
what the fuck is that 
switchblade 
goddamn it 
there must be something 
he didn t paint the fucking thing 
no  he s fucking with us 
see this  this is us 
just wait a minute 
  somerset s climbing furniture 
  wait a minute 
you re kidding me 
call the print lab 
oh  man 
honestly   
have you ever seen
anything like this 
no 
the swell pattern tells me
they re not   
the victim s prints 
i say he s whacked enough 
it doesn t fit 
he doesn t want to stop 
who knows 
freaks doing their evil deeds
they don t want to 
 voices made me do it  
 my dog made me do it  
 jodie foster told me to do it  
it can take   
3 days to make a match 
so maybe you guys want to   
cross your fingers somewhere else 
you meant what you said
to mrs  gould  didn t you 
  about catching this guy 
  yeah 
wish i still thought
the way you do 
what the hell
do you think we re doing 
picking up the pieces 
collecting evidence 
taking pictures and samples 
writing everything down 
noting the times things happened 
that s all 
that s all 
putting everything into
neat piles   
and filing it  on the off chance
it ll be needed in a courtroom 
picking up diamonds
on a desert island 
saving them in case
we get rescued 
bullshit 
even the most promising clues
only lead to others 
so many corpses roll away 
unrevenged 
don t tell me
you didn t get that rush tonight 
i saw you 
we re getting somewhere 
wake up  glimmer twins 
we got a winner 
he uses the name victor 
real name  theodore allen 
homicide found his prints
at the scene 
he s got a long history
of serious mental illness 
he got a very strict 
southern baptist upbringing 
somewhere along the line 
they fell short 
victor dabbled in drugs 
armed robbery and assault 
spent time in prison
for attempted rape of a minor 
his lawyer made sure
that didn t last long 
by the way  the lawyer was
eli gould  the  greed  victim 
we re finishing this today 
ladies and germs 
victor s been out of circulation 
but we have a residence for him 
  you re not buying this 
  doesn t seem like   
   our guy  does it 
  you tell me 
our killer seems to have
more purpose 
you ever take a bullet 
never in my 34 years 
knock wood 
i ve only taken my gun out
three times 
intending to use it 
never pulled the trigger 
not once 
you 
no  i never took a bullet 
but   
i pulled my gun once 
shot it once 
  really 
  it was my first one of these 
we were a secondary unit 
i was shaky going in 
i was a rookie 
we bust open a door 
looking for this junkie 
and he opened fire on us 
one cop got hit in the arm 
what was his name 
it spun him like a top 
well  more like slow motion 
i remember
riding in that ambulance   
and well   
he died right there 
right there 
what was his fucking name 
swat goes before dicks 
they love this 
police 
clear 
good morning  sweetheart 
get up now motherfucker  now 
get up  you sack of shit 
fuck me 
dicks 
you ll want to look at this 
dicks 
jesus 
victor 
  what the hell 
  it s just victor 
  call an ambulance 
  hearse  i d say 
call for forensics 
get your people out 
no on touches anything 
it s like a wax sculpture 
sloth 
aw  man 
goddamn 
the pictures
were dated 3 days ago 
this must be the first 
look 
it s dated one year ago today 
i got a hair sample 
i got a stool sample  piss 
fingernails 
he s laughing at us 
you got what you deserved 
he s alive 
cocksucker s alive 
guns down 
emergency on that ambulance 
  he s playing games 
  no shit 
we have to divorce our emotions 
we must focus on details 
i feed off my emotions 
how s that 
  are you listening to me 
  yes  i can hear you 
  excuse me 
  what are you doing 
  closed crime scene  out 
  i got a right to be here 
i m a upi photographer 
i got a right to be here 
  get out  jesus 
  fucking jerk 
i got your picture  man 
i got your picture 
detective mills  m i l l s 
fuck off 
  you can spell 
  fuck you 
how do they get here so quick 
the pay police for information 
they pay well 
hey  man  i m sorry 
they piss me off 
okay 
it s impressive to see
a man feeding off his emotions 
one year of immobility 
judging by   
muscle and spine deterioration 
blood tests show a smorgasbord
of drugs in his system 
even an antibiotic 
probably to prevent
the bedsores from infecting 
has he tried to speak 
or communicate in any way 
even if his brain
were not mush  which it is 
he chewed off his tongue long ago 
doc   
is there no chance
he might survive 
he d die of shock now
if you shined a flashlight
in his eyes 
he s had as much pain
and suffering as anyone 
and he still has
hell to look forward to 
good night 
hello  william  it s tracy 
tracy 
everything okay 
yeah  yes  everything s fine 
where s david 
in the other room 
in the shower 
sorry to call you like this 
it s all right 
what can i do for you 
i need someone to talk to 
do you think you could
meet me somewhere 
maybe tomorrow morning 
i don t understand 
i feel stupid calling 
but you re the only person
i know here 
there s no on else 
if you can 
give me a call  okay 
i have to go now 
  good night 
  good night 
i mean   
you know this city so well 
you ve been here   
so long 
it can be a hard place 
i don t know why
i asked you to come 
why don t you talk to him 
tell him how you feel 
i can t be a burden 
especially now 
i ll get used to things 
you know 
i wanted to talk to someone
who s lived here a long time 
upstate  it s a completely
different environment 
did david tell you
i teach 5th grade  i did 
he mentioned it 
i ve been going around 
looking at schools 
but here the conditions here
are horrible 
what about private schools 
i don t know 
tell me what s
really bothering you 
david and i
are going to have a baby 
tracy  i   
i don t think i m   
the one to talk to   
   about this 
  i hate this city 
i had a relationship once 
it was like a marriage 
we got pregnant 
this was a long time ago 
i remember getting up
and going to work 
a day like any other 
but the first day after i knew
about the pregnancy 
and i felt this fear 
for the first time ever 
i remember thinking 
how can i bring a child
into a world like this 
how can a person grow up
with all this around them 
i told her i didn t want it 
over the next few weeks 
i wore her down 
i want to have children 
i can tell you now that   
i know  i mean 
i m positive that
i made the right decision 
but not a day passes
that i don t wish
that i d made
a different choice 
if you don t   
keep the baby   
if that s your decision 
don t ever tell him
you were pregnant 
but if you choose to
have this baby 
then spoil that kid 
every chance you get 
that s about   
all the advice
i can give you  tracy 
i got to go 
william 
thank you 
victor s landlord said
there was cash in the mailbox 
first of every month 
quote 
 i never heard a single complaint
from the tenant   
in apartment 306 
and nobody complained about him 
best tenant i ve ever had  
a landlord s dream 
a paralyzed tenant
with no tongue 
who pays the rent on time 
i m sick of this waiting 
this is the job 
why aren t we out there 
why sit here rotting 
waiting till the lunatic
does it again 
 lunatic  is dismissive 
don t make that mistake 
come on  he s insane 
look 
right now he s dancing
in his grandma s panties 
rubbing himself in peanut butter 
  how s that 
  i don t think so 
his luck will run out 
he s not depending on luck 
we walk in exactly one year
after victor s tied to the bed 
one year to the day 
  he wanted us to 
  don t know that for sure 
oh  yes we do 
the note he left 
his first words to us 
 long is the way and hard
that out of hell
leads up to light  
fuck him  so what 
he s right so far 
imagine the will to keep
a man bound for a year 
to sever his hand
and to use it   
to plant fingerprints 
to insert tubes into
his genitals 
the guy s methodical  exacting
and worst of all  patient 
he s a nutbag 
because he s got a library card
doesn t make him yoda 
you got money 
i got 50 bucks 
i propose a field trip 
come on 
we ll make a list 
at the top we put  purgatory  
 canterbury tales 
anything on the 7 deadly sins 
  ask yourself 
  wait 
what would he study
