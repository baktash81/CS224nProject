both barrels
a crime of passion
yeah
just look at all the passion
on that wall
this is a done deal
all but the paperwork
did the kid see it
what
the kid
what kind of questions that
well be glad to
get rid of you somerset
always these questions
did the kid see it
who gives a fuck
hes dead
his wife killed him
the rest is nothing to do with us
detective somerset
im detective mills
i get in town 20 minutes ago
they dump me here
look
mills
lets find a bar
sit and talk
id like to get to the precinct
not much time for
this transition thing
i had a question
when we spoke on the phone
yeah
why here
i dont follow
all this effort
to get transferred
its the first question
that popped into my head
same reasons as you
or the reasons you had
before you decided to quit
you just met me
maybe i dont understand
the question
its very simple
you actually fought
to get reassigned here
i never saw it done that way
thought id do some good
be great if we didnt start out
kicking each other in the balls
youre calling the shots
yes
i want you to look
and listen okay
i wasnt guarding a taco bell
i worked homicide 5 years
not here
i understand
over the next 7 days
do me a favor and remember that
yeah okay
say it again
i thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls
serpicos got to go
you might want to get rid of
this crusty this eye serpico
did you get it
got it
good
coffee no
nothings been touched
its all like i found it
what time was death established
like i said
i didnt touch anything
but hes had his face
in spaghetti for 45 minutes
no one bothers with vital signs
did i stutter
he aint breathing unless
hes breathing spaghetti sauce
thats how its done around here
i beg your pardon detective
but the guys sitting in a pile
of his own piss and shit
if he wasnt dead
he would have stood up by now
alright
thank you officer
thank you
i wonder
what was the point
of that conversation
i dont know
how many times barney five found
dead bodies that werent dead
drop it
phone guinness
i think we got a record here
better homes and gardens
who said this was murder
no one
guys heart must be
the size of a canned ham
if this isnt a coronary
well
i dont know
whoops
how about that
we had this case once
guy dead on the ground
knife in his back
murder right
fuck
big insurance policy involved
guy took the tip of the blade
stuck it in
his own shoulder blades
he must have screwed up
because there were
multiples back there
please be quiet
wait a minute
what
we got a bucket here
whats in it
my god
fucking vomit
any blood in it
i didnt see any
help yourself
are you thinking its poison
oh wonderful very moody
think its poison somerset
you girls have got
forensics waiting outside
we might not fit
theres room
lights the problem
how are you
detective mills
go help the officers
question the neighbors
what
and send in forensics
hes dead
thank you doctor
you saw my files
the things ive done
nope
i did doortodoors
walked the beat all that shit
a long time
and
my badge says
detective same as yours
look i made a decision
i had to consider
the integrity of the crime scene
not whether you were getting
enough time in the field
hey man
just dont jerk me off
thats all i ask
hes been dead
a long time
and not from poison
oh man
how can you
let yourself go like this
it took four orderlies
just to get him on the table
howd the fat fuck
fit out his door
its obvious he was a shutin
see how big this stomach is
strange thing is it stretches
look the size of the
cardiac orifice where the food
i see that
but it means nothing to me
hes got lines of distention
across the duodenum
the interior walls ripped open
this man ate till he burst
no he didnt burst all the way
he was hemorrhaging internally
there was a hematoma
in the rectus and
the abdominal muscles
he did die by eating
yes and no
what about these bruises here
i havent figured that out yet
gun pressed against his head
pressed hard enough
fuck yeah
on the front
flush with the muzzle
ladies and gentlemen
we have a homicide
killer put a bucket under him
took his time too
coroner said
it couldve lasted 12 hours
victims throat was swollen
probably from the effort
and there was a point
when he passed out
thats when the killer kicked him
and he burst
sadistic fucker
when you want somebody dead
you drive by and shoot
you dont risk
the time it takes for this
unless the act itself
has meaning
somebody had a problem with
a fat boy and tortured him simple
in the grocer bags
we found two receipts
so the killer went back
to the supermarket
so
its his thing
ive been out in the rain
this is a beginning
weve got
one dead guy not three
no motive
dont start
that big brain of yours
cooking on this alright
id like to be reassigned
whoa
what are you talking about
this cant be my last duty
itll go on and on
youre retiring in 6 days
youve left
unfinished business before
the cases were taken
as close as possible to conclusion
may i speak freely
were friends here
it shouldnt be his first case
i knew it its not
my first assignment you dick
its too soon for him
you can say that shit
to my face captain
its too soon for you
captain
can we talk in private
this is a personal thing
just shut up mills
i dont have anyone else
to put on this
this is metro
you dont just get to swap
give it to me
what
he wants out fuck him
see you have a nice time
give it to me
ill put you on something else
go on mills just go on
im sorry old buddy
but it looks like youre stuck
cleaning up the fat man
quiet down
alright calm down calm down
quiet down
heres how itll work
ill answer questions
for 10 minutes only
ask those questions in a calm
orderly fashion or i will leave
detective
can i have a moment
no
i wont discuss the details
of this investigation
so dont bother asking
what you got for me
nothing yet boss
why dont you guys
go get a coffee
we have this breaking story
lets go downtown where attorney
eli gould
was found murdered today
da martin talbot is taking
questions from reporters
thats ridiculous and offensive
there is no conflict
and any claim there could be
is irresponsible
now hold on
i just met with
law enforcement officials
and they have
their very best men on this
this will be the definition
of swift justice
pardon me george
somerset
come in
you heard the news
nope havent heard

his watch is taken his wallet
and while hes lying on
the sidewalk
helpless
his attacker stabs him
in both eyes
this happened last night

its the way its always been
maybe youre right
you were made for this work
you cant deny that
maybe im wrong
coroner sent this for you
found them in
the fat boys stomach
mixed in with the food
looks like little pieces
of plastic
set them on that desk
they were
fed to him
lord
this was found behind the fridge
in the obesity murder scene
long is the way
and hard that out of hell
leads up to the light
its from milton
paradise lost
alright
im confused
it means that
this is a beginning
this was behind the fridge
written in grease
there are 7 deadly sins captain
gluttony
greed
sloth wrath
pride lust
and envy
seven
hold on

why arent you married william
tracy
what the hell
i was close once
it just didnt happen
it surprises me
it really does
well
anyone who spends much time
with me finds me disagreeable
just ask your husband
very true
very very true
how long have you lived here
too long
how do you like it
you know
takes time settle in
itll be good
you get numb after a while
there are things to any city
subway
itll go away in a minute
real estate guy
fucking piece of sorry honey

i think hes good
hes efficient
trace really likes it
then we wonder why he only
brings us here for 5 minutes
we found out the first night
the soothing relaxing
vibrating home
im sorry
yeah alright laugh it up
i dont know why youre laughing
alright already
he had to get into the building
before the office closed
gould wouldve been working late
im certain
the biggest defense lawyer
in town infamous really
the body was found
on tuesday morning
the office was closed monday
he couldve gotten in friday
laid low till the cleaners left
then had his way
with gould saturday sunday
maybe monday
look
gould was bound right arm free
he was handed a butchers knife
check out the scale
a pound of flesh
one pound of flesh
no more no less
no cartilage
no bone
only flesh
merchant of venice
didnt see it
this task done
and he would go free
that chair was
soaked with sweat
of course
the killer wanted gould
to take his time
deciding which cut
to make first
imagine it
theres a gun in your face
which part of your body
is expendable
the love handle
cut along the side
of his own stomach
lets take a fresh look
the corpse is there but
iook through it
edit out your initial shock
the trick is to find
one item one detail
and focus on it
till its an exhausted possibility
ill get another beer beer
wine please
hes preaching
punishing
the sins were used
in medieval sermons
7 cardinal virtues 7 deadly sins
used as teaching tools
yeah like in
the parsons tale and dante
you read them
yeah
parts
remember in purgatory
dante and his buddy
climb up
the hill and check out
the sinners
the 7 terraces of purgation
yeah right
but there pride comes first
not gluttony
lets consider the books
as the killers inspiration
the sermons were about
atonement for sin
these murders are like
forced attrition
forced what
attritions when you
regret your sins
but not for love of god
because of a gun in your face
no fingerprints
no
totally unrelated victims
and no witnesses
which i dont get
because the fucker
had to get back out
in a major city
minding your business is a science
in rape prevention they tell you
never to cry for help
always yell fire
nobody answers help
holler fire theyll come
thats fucked up
he must have left
another puzzle piece
thanks for talking this out
but i got to sleep
i got to walk the dogs
this is just to satisfy
my curiosity
im leaving the end of the week
shit no wait
goulds wife was out of town
so this means she saw something
what if its a threat
i put her in a safehouse
she wasnt happy about it
what if it isnt
what shes seen
but what shes supposed to
and hasnt yet
yeah okay what
i dont know
but thats the one thing
ill sign us in
gotta see mrs gould
mrs gould
mrs gould im sorry
i truly am
i dont understand
i need you to look at each photo
very carefully
see if anythings strange
out of place anything at all
i dont see anything
youre sure
please
i cant do this right now
okay
its got to be now
maybe we missed something
wait
what
here
this painting its upside down
your men didnt move this
no
those shots were taken
before forensics
nothing
theres got to be something
he moved the screws
to rehang it
what the fuck is that
switchblade
goddamn it
there must be something
he didnt paint the fucking thing
no hes fucking with us
see this this is us
just wait a minute
somersets climbing furniture
wait a minute
youre kidding me
call the print lab
oh man
honestly
have you ever seen
anything like this
no
the swell pattern tells me
theyre not
the victims prints
i say hes whacked enough
it doesnt fit
he doesnt want to stop
who knows
freaks doing their evil deeds
they dont want to
voices made me do it
my dog made me do it
jodie foster told me to do it
it can take
3 days to make a match
so maybe you guys want to
cross your fingers somewhere else
you meant what you said
to mrs gould didnt you
about catching this guy
yeah
wish i still thought
the way you do
what the hell
do you think were doing
picking up the pieces
collecting evidence
taking pictures and samples
writing everything down
noting the times things happened
thats all
thats all
putting everything into
neat piles
and filing it on the off chance
itll be needed in a courtroom
picking up diamonds
on a desert island
saving them in case
we get rescued
bullshit
even the most promising clues
only lead to others
so many corpses roll away
unrevenged
dont tell me
you didnt get that rush tonight
i saw you
were getting somewhere
wake up glimmer twins
we got a winner
he uses the name victor
real name theodore allen
homicide found his prints
at the scene
hes got a long history
of serious mental illness
he got a very strict
southern baptist upbringing
somewhere along the line
they fell short
victor dabbled in drugs
armed robbery and assault
spent time in prison
for attempted rape of a minor
his lawyer made sure
that didnt last long
by the way the lawyer was
eli gould the greed victim
were finishing this today
ladies and germs
victors been out of circulation
but we have a residence for him
youre not buying this
doesnt seem like
our guy does it
you tell me
our killer seems to have
more purpose
you ever take a bullet
never in my 34 years
knock wood
ive only taken my gun out
three times
intending to use it
never pulled the trigger
not once
you
no i never took a bullet
but
i pulled my gun once
shot it once
really
it was my first one of these
we were a secondary unit
i was shaky going in
i was a rookie
we bust open a door
looking for this junkie
and he opened fire on us
one cop got hit in the arm
what was his name
it spun him like a top
well more like slow motion
i remember
riding in that ambulance
and well
he died right there
right there
what was his fucking name
swat goes before dicks
they love this
police
clear
good morning sweetheart
get up now motherfucker now
get up you sack of shit
fuck me
dicks
youll want to look at this
dicks
jesus
victor
what the hell
its just victor
call an ambulance
hearse id say
call for forensics
get your people out
no on touches anything
its like a wax sculpture
sloth
aw man
goddamn
the pictures
were dated 3 days ago
this must be the first
look
its dated one year ago today
i got a hair sample
i got a stool sample piss
fingernails
hes laughing at us
you got what you deserved
hes alive
cocksuckers alive
guns down
emergency on that ambulance
hes playing games
no shit
we have to divorce our emotions
we must focus on details
i feed off my emotions
hows that
are you listening to me
yes i can hear you
excuse me
what are you doing
closed crime scene out
i got a right to be here
im a upi photographer
i got a right to be here
get out jesus
fucking jerk
i got your picture man
i got your picture
detective mills mills
fuck off
you can spell
fuck you
how do they get here so quick
the pay police for information
they pay well
hey man im sorry
they piss me off
okay
its impressive to see
a man feeding off his emotions
one year of immobility
judging by
muscle and spine deterioration
blood tests show a smorgasbord
of drugs in his system
even an antibiotic
probably to prevent
the bedsores from infecting
has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way
even if his brain
were not mush which it is
he chewed off his tongue long ago
doc
is there no chance
he might survive
hed die of shock now
if you shined a flashlight
in his eyes
hes had as much pain
and suffering as anyone
and he still has
hell to look forward to
good night
hello william its tracy
tracy
everything okay
yeah yes everythings fine
wheres david
in the other room
in the shower
sorry to call you like this
its all right
what can i do for you
i need someone to talk to
do you think you could
meet me somewhere
maybe tomorrow morning
i dont understand
i feel stupid calling
but youre the only person
i know here
theres no on else
if you can
give me a call okay
i have to go now
good night
good night
i mean
you know this city so well
youve been here
so long
it can be a hard place
i dont know why
i asked you to come
why dont you talk to him
tell him how you feel
i cant be a burden
especially now
ill get used to things
you know
i wanted to talk to someone
whos lived here a long time
upstate its a completely
different environment
did david tell you
i teach 5th grade i did
he mentioned it
ive been going around
looking at schools
but here the conditions here
are horrible
what about private schools
i dont know
tell me whats
really bothering you
david and i
are going to have a baby
tracy i
i dont think im
the one to talk to
about this
i hate this city
i had a relationship once
it was like a marriage
we got pregnant
this was a long time ago
i remember getting up
and going to work
a day like any other
but the first day after i knew
about the pregnancy
and i felt this fear
for the first time ever
i remember thinking
how can i bring a child
into a world like this
how can a person grow up
with all this around them
i told her i didnt want it
over the next few weeks
i wore her down
i want to have children
i can tell you now that
i know i mean
im positive that
i made the right decision
but not a day passes
that i dont wish
that id made
a different choice
if you dont
keep the baby
if thats your decision
dont ever tell him
you were pregnant
but if you choose to
have this baby
then spoil that kid
every chance you get
thats about
all the advice
i can give you tracy
i got to go
william
thank you
victors landlord said
there was cash in the mailbox
first of every month
quote
i never heard a single complaint
from the tenant
in apartment 306
and nobody complained about him
best tenant ive ever had
a landlords dream
a paralyzed tenant
with no tongue
who pays the rent on time
im sick of this waiting
this is the job
why arent we out there
why sit here rotting
waiting till the lunatic
does it again
lunatic is dismissive
dont make that mistake
come on hes insane
look
right now hes dancing
in his grandmas panties
rubbing himself in peanut butter
hows that
i dont think so
his luck will run out
hes not depending on luck
we walk in exactly one year
after victors tied to the bed
one year to the day
he wanted us to
dont know that for sure
oh yes we do
the note he left
his first words to us
long is the way and hard
that out of hell
leads up to light
fuck him so what
hes right so far
imagine the will to keep
a man bound for a year
to sever his hand
and to use it
to plant fingerprints
to insert tubes into
his genitals
the guys methodical exacting
and worst of all patient
hes a nutbag
because hes got a library card
doesnt make him yoda
you got money
i got 50 bucks
i propose a field trip
come on
well make a list
at the top we put purgatory
canterbury tales
anything on the 7 deadly sins
ask yourself
wait
what would he study
