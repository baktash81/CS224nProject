you must see to believe 
way up in the mountains 
in the high range of pontoos   
lay the small town of whoville 
the home of the whos 
ask any who 
and they ll have this to say 
 there is no place like whoville
around christmas day  
every window was flocked 
every lamppost was dressed   
and the whoville band marched
in their christmas y best 
merry christmas  merry christmas 
arbor day was fine 
and easter was pleasant   
and every saint fizzin s day 
they ate a fizz pheasant 
but every who knew 
from their twelve toes to their snout   
they loved christmas the most 
without a single who doubt 
  farfingle s welcomes you 
  thank you

this is what christmas is all about 
can t you feel it 
merry christmas 
thank you for shopping farfingle s 
wait a second 
your change 
another minute closer to christmas 
and  for the next five minutes only 
99 percent off 
yes  every who down in whoville
liked christmas a lot   
but the grinch 
who lived just north of whoville   
did not 
get on it  girls 
all the good mistletoe s at the top 
  hey  drew  i ll race you 
  not if i race you first 
last one to the top
is a stinky old grinch 
you guys  where are we 
i think we should go back 
what  you re scared of the grinch 
no 
they say he lives up here in a big cave 
and only comes down
when he s hungry for the taste of   
  who flesh 
  drew 
you re scared of the grinch 
you re scared of the grinch 
  are too 
  am not 
wait for me 
go on  touch it  touch the door 
do it for me  stu 
well done  max 
serves them right 
those yuletide loving   
sickly sweet  nog sucking cheer mongers 
i really don t like them 
no  i don t 
max 
get my cloak 
i ve been much too tolerant
of these whovenile delinquents   
and their innocent  victimless pranks 
so  they want to get
to know me  do they 
they want to spend a little quality time
with the grinch 
i guess i could use a little   
social interaction 
merry christmas 
yeah  you bet 
ho  ho  ho  and stuff 
oh  my 
someone has vandalized that vehicle 
you see  max 
the city is a dangerous place 
the grinch hated christmas 
the whole christmas season 
top of the day  flatfoot 
now  please  don t ask why 
no one quite knows the reason 
here s a present for you 
be sure to run real fast with it 
come on  double time  move 
it could be that his head
wasn t screwed on just right 
or it could be  perhaps 
that his shoes were too tight 
but i think that
the most likely reason of all   
may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small 
stranger  won t let you go
till you buy a chapeau 
boy  nothing beats christmas  right 
i guess 
you guess 
it s just  i look around at you and mom
and everyone getting all kerbobbled 
doesn t this seem superfluous 
dad

marks the one thousandth whobilation 
whoville s most important celebration

is a time we must treasure

were not up on mount crumpit   
provoking the one creature
within a billion bilometers of here   
who hates christmas 
but it was the grinch 
no  sir  the boys didn t see any grinch 
it was  and he came after

hello 
hello 
how are you 
how are you 
i asked you first 
i asked you first 
that s really mature 
saying exactly what i say 
mature    exactly    what i say   
i m an idiot 
you re an idiot 
all right  fine 
i m not talking to you anymore 
in fact  i m going to whisper 
so that by the time my voice reverberates
off the walls and gets back to me   
i won t be able to hear it 
you re an idiot 
am i just eating because i m bored 
who could that be 
hello  little girl 
are you here to read to us 
no 
i hear you know some things
about the grinch 
cindy lou had some questions
in her curious heart 
why did the grinch hate christmas 
where did it all start 
with her dad s blabbacorder
she wouldn t give an inch 
in your own words  please tell me
everything you know about the grinch 
where did he come from 
he came the way all who babies come 
on calm nights   
baby who girls and tiny who fellas   
drift from the sky
in their own pumbersellas 
hey  honey  our baby is here 
he looks just like your boss 
so that s how it works 
it was christmas eve 
and a strange wind blew that night 
we were having
our annual holiday get together 
it was morning before anybody realized
that he was out there 
the poor dear 
but  you know what 
we knew right away that he was special 
do you want a christmas cookie 
yes  which christmas cookie
would you like 
santa 
his first words 
yes  that is a santa plate 
do you want to hold this santa plate 
santa  bye bye 
he was a wonderful   
whatever he was 
and we raised him
like any other who child 
with a deep love of christmas 
don t forget  tomorrow
is our big christmas gift exchange 
everyone bring a special gift
for a special someone 
the   
grinch   
he had no sense of color coordination 
although i hardly remember him 
i didn t have time to socialize 
i was far too busy with my   
studies 
now  class  is everyone almost finished 
and if the truth be told  he   
he liked martha 
martha was my girlfriend 
i don t like discussing this grinch
so very close to christmas  but   
maybe if you hear the truth 
you ll understand why   
put your back into it 
i tried to take him under my wing 
you don t have a chance with her 
you re 8 years old and you have a beard 
he had hair  not pleasant 
he shed 
not right 
you know  christmas
is my favorite time of year 
i just love the colors 
the red   
and the green 
did i have a crush on the grinch 
of course not 
i didn t ask you that 
right 
for some reason 
when he came home that day   
he really got into the christmas spirit
for the first time 
perfect 
whoopsie 
what a lovely family heirloom 
the fires of love 
this will be perfect
on the top of her tree 
oh  martha  oh  christmas 
i want you all to look
your best tomorrow 
you don t have a chance with her 
you re 8 years old and you have a beard 
has everyone given their gifts 
  i haven t 
  what 
merry christmas  martha may 
why do you have a bag on your head 
probably because he s embarrassed
by that hideodorous gift 
mr  grinch   
please take the bag off 
yes  you 
take it off 
put the book down 
and your foot 
look at that hack job 
stupid present 
stupid tree 
i hate christmas 
  the anger 
  the fury 
the muscles 
it was a horrible day
when they were so cruel to him 
and   
i could hardly bear it 
i hate christmas  i hate it 
and that was the last time
we ever saw him 
the very last time 
so  whatever the reason 
his heart or his shoes   
he stood outside his cave   
hating the whos 
alphabetically 
aardvarkian abakenezer who   
i   
hate you 
aaron b  benson who  i hate you 
hate  hate  hate  hate  hate  hate 
double hate 
loathe entirely 
nutcrackers 
it s their whobilation 
he snarled with a sneer 
tomorrow is christmas 
it s practically here 
max 
fetch me my sedative 
now to take care
of those pesky memories 
 whobilation  plentiful
with candy canes and pies
 i can t wait to get there
to eat some google fries
 whobilation  whobilation 
  dad 
  yeah 
i ve been thinking about the whobilation
and i may do something drastic 
that s fine  dear  ask your mother 
  where did she go 
  honey 
honey  hi 
look  i just found the cutest light
for my christmas display 
hurry up  we re gonna be late  come on 
and now  the nominations   
for that who among us
who best typifies   
the qualities of whodom and whodery   
the whoville holiday cheermeister 
do i hear a nomination 
i nominate the grinch 
  the grinch 
  the grinch 
my  my  my 
what an altruistic daughter
you have there  lou 
thank you 
cindy 
let me quote a verse   
from the book of who 
thank you 
 the term  grinchy  shall apply
when christmas spirit is in short supply  
now  i ask you  does that sound
like our holiday cheermeister 
true  mr  may who 
but the book of who says this too 
 no matter how different
a who may appear   
 he will always be welcomed
with holiday cheer  
yes  the book also says  the   
 the award   
 cannot go to the grinch  because   
 sometimes things
get the lead pipe cinch  
you made that up  it doesn t say that 
no  it does 
what page 
lost my place  but it s   
it s in here 
but the book does say 
 the cheermeister is the one
who deserves a back slap or a toast 
 and it goes to the soul at christmas
who needs it most  
and i believe that soul is the grinch 
and if you re the whos i hope you are 
you will too 
she s right 
fine 
you people want to waste
a perfectly good nomination   
why  it s up to you 
but i am telling you   
the grinch will never come down 
and when he doesn t 
the mayor will wear the crown 
well  more or less 
 deck your heart with jollity
 style your smile all christmas y
 flick some flocking on the tree
 let there be whobilation
 bake the fruitcake  egg the nog
 feed the flaming who ltide log
 baste the beast and gulp the grog
 let there be whobilation
 tick  tock  tick  tock
 counting down the christmas clock
 old  young  big  small 
blast this christmas music 
it s joyful and triumphant 
must drown them out 
not working 
the whipperwinds whipped
high above the who town 
a trip or a slip
you d slide all the way down 
but this girl had a mission 
she knew what to do 
she d invite the grinch herself 
that brave cindy lou 
play  monkey  play 
howdy 
mr  grinch 
mr  grinch 
hello 
excuse me 
hello   
little girl 
how dare you enter   
the grinch s lair 
the impudence  the audacity 
the unmitigated gall 
you called down the thunder   
now  get ready for the boom 
gaze into the face of fear 
mr  grinch   
my name is cindy lou who 
you see 
even now the terror
is welling up inside you 
i m not scared 
denial is to be expected
in the face of pure evil 
i don t think so

of the heebie jeebies 
now you re doomed 
run for your life   
before i kill again 
i m a psycho 
danger  danger

to be holiday cheermeister

i know you hate christmas 
but what if it s all just a misunderstanding 
  don t care 
  i myself am having some yuletide doubts 
but maybe if you reunite
with the whos and be a part of christmas   
 maybe if you reunite with the whos
and be a part of christmas

then maybe it ll be
all right for me  too

the mayor wasn t happy

on a flat faced floogle horse 
i m sorry to disappoint you  martha  baby 
but the g train has left the station 
so  will you come 
all right 
i don t know if it s
that adorable twinkle in your eye   
or that nonconformist streak

less hairy me 
but you ve convinced me 
who knows  this whobilation
could change my entire outlook on life 
  really 
  no 
there you are  honey

we can t be late for the whobilation 
the nerve of those whos 
inviting me down there

my schedule wouldn t allow it 
 4 00  wallow in self pity 
 4 30  stare into the abyss 
 5 00  solve world hunger   
 tell no one 
 5 30  jazzercise 
 6 30  dinner with me  
i can t cancel that again 
 7 00  wrestle with my self loathing  
i m booked 
if i bumped the loathing to 9 00 
i d have time to lay in bed   
stare at the ceiling
and slip slowly into madness 
but what would i wear 
it s not a dress  it s a kilt 
sicko 
stupid 
ugly 
out of date 
this is ridiculous 
if i can t find something nice to wear

and rush for their toys 
and then  the noise 
the noise  noise  noise 
they ll bang on tong tinglers 
they ll blow their floo flounders 
they ll crash on jang jinglers
and bounce on boing bounders 
then whos young and old
would sit down to a feast 
and they ll feast and they ll feast 
and they ll feast  feast  feast  feast 
they ll eat their who pudding 
and rare who roast beast 
but there s something
i just cannot stand in the least 
oh  no

of what christmas would bring   
the more the grinch thought 
i must stop this whole thing 
why  for year after year
i ve put up with it now 
i must stop this christmas from coming 
but how 
i mean  in what way 
 christmas is goin  to the dogs
 we re scoffing down
the turkey and the grog
 things are looking
very good  it s true 
are you having a holly  jolly   
christmas 
wrong o 
if you re not going to help me   
then you might as well   
then he got an idea 
an awful idea 
the grinch got a wonderful   
awful idea 
i know just what to do 
the grinch laughed in his throat 
and he made a quick
santy claus hat and a coat 
and he chuckled and clucked   
at this great grinchy trick 
with this coat and this hat 
i ll look just like saint nick 
 you re a mean one  mr  grinch
 you really are a heel
 you re as cuddly as a cactus
and as charming as an eel
 mr  grinch
 you re a bad banana
 with a greasy black peel
 just face the music  you re a monster
 mr  grinch  yes  you are
 your heart s an empty hole
 your brain is full of spiders
you got garlic in your soul
 mr  grinch
 i wouldn t touch you with a
 thirty nine and a half foot pole 
i asked for three quarters 
not five eighths 
stay focused 
 you know  if you asked
the who s who of whoville
 no one would deny it 
air bag is a little slow 
but that s what these tests are for 
 you re a vile one
 mr  grinch
 you have termites in your smile
 you have all the tender sweetness
of a seasick crocodile
 mr  grinch
 given the choice between you
 i d take the seasick crocodile 
fat boy should be finishing up
anytime now 
talk about a recluse 
he only comes out once a year 
and he never catches any flak for it 
probably lives up there
to avoid the taxes 
merry christmas 
oopsie 
forgot about the reindeer 
did that stop the old grinch 
no 
the grinch simply said 
if i can t find a reindeer   
i ll make one instead 
oh  max 
so he called his dog max   
and he took some red thread   
and tied a big horn on top of his head 
all right 
you re a reindeer 
here s your motivation 
you re rudolph  a freak with a red nose 
nobody likes you 
then one day 
santa picks you and you save christmas 
no  forget that part  we ll improvise 
just keep it kind of loosey goosey 
you hate christmas 
you re gonna steal it 
saving christmas was a lousy ending 
way too commercial 
action 
brilliant 
you reject your own nose   
because it represents the
glitter of commercialism 
why didn t i think of that 
cut  print  check the gate  moving on 
that   
feels   
good 
here goes nothin   hot dog 
wow 
this is nuts 
on  crasher  on  thrasher 
on  vomit and blitzkrieg 
we re gonna die 
we re gonna die 
i m going to throw up 
and then i m gonna die 
mommy  tell it to stop 
almost lost my cool there 
all their windows were dark 
quiet snow filled the air 
all the whos were all dreaming
sweet dreams without care   
when he came to the first
little house on the square 
welcome to whoville  max 
betty 
  betty 
  what 
did you hear something 
it s santa 
go right back to sleep 
come on  max  it s our first stop 
the old grinchy claus hissed 
and he climbed to the roof 
empty bags in his fist 
he d slide down the chimney 
a rather tight pinch 
but if santa could do it 
then so could the grinch 
he s planning a double twisting
interrupted forward flying 2 and a half   
with a combo tuck and pike 
high degree of difficulty 
he got stuck only once 
for a moment or two 
blasted water weight 
goes right to my hips 
then he stuck his head
out of the fireplace flue 
a little more stealth  please 
where the little who stockings
all hung in a row 
these stockings   
he grinned   
are the first thing to go 
okay  fellas  show time 
then he slunk to the icebox 
slunk 
he eyed the whos  feast 
he took the who pudding 
he took the roast beast 
hike 
he cleaned out that icebox
as quick as a flash 
why  that grinch 
he even took their last can of who hash 
then he stuffed all the food
up the chimney with glee 
and now   
grinned the grinch   
i ll stuff up the tree 
and the grinch grabbed the tree 
and he started to shove   
when he heard a small sound
like the coo of a dove 
excuse me 
the grinch had been caught
by this tiny who daughter   
who d got out of bed
for a cup of cold water 
santa claus 
what are you doing with our tree 
but  you know  that old grinch
was so smart and so slick   
he thought up a lie 
and he thought it up quick 
why   
my sweet little tot 
the fake santa claus lied 
there s a light on this tree   
that won t   
light on one side 
so i m taking it home
to my workshop  my dear 
i ll fix it up there   
and i ll bring it back here 
santa  what s christmas really about 
vengeance 
i mean   
presents   
i suppose 
i was afraid of that 
and his fib fooled the child 
then he patted her head 
and he got her a drink   
and he sent her to bed 
santa 
  what 
  don t forget the grinch 
i know he s mean and hairy and smelly 
his hands might be cold and clammy 
but i think he s actually kind of sweet 
sweet 
you think he s sweet 
merry christmas  santa 
and when cindy lou
went up with her cup   
nice kid 
bad judge of character 
   he went to the chimney
and stuffed the tree up 
and the last thing he took
was the log for their fire 
on their walls he left nothing
but some hooks and some wire 
and the one speck of food
that he d left in the house   
was a crumb that was even
too small for a mouse 
then he slithered and slunk 
with a smile most unpleasant   
around each who home 
and he took every present 
clearance sale 
everything must go 
what now 
martha   
have you ever kissed a man
who lost his tonsils twice 
no  silly 
but it s an experience
that i ve always longed for 
kiss me  you fool 
what are you laughing at   
rudolph 
it s all you  maxie 
3 000 feet up 
up the side of mount crumpit   
he rode with his load
to the tiptop to dump it 
we did it 
we did it  we did it 
that wasn t so bad  was it  max 
they ll be waking up now 
and i know just what they ll do 
all those whos   
down in whoville   
will all cry 
what an embarrassment  i ve been robbed 
mayor may who  oh  dear 
i wonder who could have done this 
tell you people one thing 
invite the grinch   
destroy christmas 
invite the grinch   
destroy christmas 
but did anyone listen to me 
  i did 
  no 
you choose to listen   
to a little not to be taken
seriously girl   
who hasn t even grown into her nose yet 
cindy  i hope you re very proud   
of what you ve done 
if she isn t  i am 
i m glad he took our presents 
  what 
  i   
  i m glad 
  he s glad 
you re glad 
you re glad everything is gone 
you re glad that the grinch
virtually wrecked   
no  not wrecked  pulverized christmas 
is that what i m hearing 
you can t hurt christmas  mr  mayor   
because it isn t about the gifts
or the contests or the fancy lights 
that s what cindy s been trying
to tell everyone 
and me  she s been trying to tell me 
what is wrong with you  this is a child 
she s my child 
and she happens to be right  by the way 
i don t need anything more for christmas
than this right here  my family 
  merry christmas  everybody 
  merry christmas 
merry christmas 
you hunk of burnin  who 
give me a break 
merry christmas 
mr  grinch 
mr  grinch 
now for the final note in my symphony   
of downright nasty not niceness 
the crescendo of my odious opus 
the wailing and the gnashing of teeth 
the bellowing
of the bitterly bummed out 
it ll be like music to my ears 
then the grinch heard
a sound rising over the snow 
it started in low 
then it started to grow 
but the sound wasn t sad 
why  this sounded merry 
but it was merry 
very 
every who down in whoville 
the tall and the small   
were singing
without any presents at all 
he hadn t stopped christmas from coming 
it came 
somehow or other  it came just the same 
mr  grinch 
and the grinch  with his grinch
feet ice cold in the snow   
stood puzzling and puzzling 
how could it be so 
it came without ribbons 
it came without tags 
it came without packages  boxes or bags 
and he puzzled and puzzled   
till his puzzler was sore 
then the grinch thought of something   
he hadn t before 
maybe   
christmas   
he thought   
doesn t come from a store 
maybe christmas   
perhaps   
means a little bit more 
help me 
i m   
feeling 
and what happened then   
well  in whoville they say   
that the grinch s small heart   
grew three sizes that day 
what s happening to me 
i m all   
toasty inside 
and i m leaking 
oh  max 
i love you 
all right  that s enough 
knock it off  beat it 
get out of here 
one step at a time 
no  the sleigh  the presents 
they ll be destroyed 
and i care 
what is the deal 
wait 
this can t happen 
it shouldn t  it couldn t 
it mustn t  it wouldn t 
not now  not then  not ever again 
no 
oh  well

so he brought back the toys
and the food for the feast 
and he  he himself  the grinch   
carved the roast beast 
yeah 
there s nothin  like the holidays 
  who wants the gizzard 
  i do 
too late 
that ll be mine 
where are you  christmas 
i think i ve found you
this time i ll make you stay
all will be singing
bells will be ringing
now and forever
christmas day
where are you  christmas
why can t i find you
why have you gone away
where is the laughter
you used to bring me
why can t i hear music play
my world is changing
i m rearranging
does that mean christmas
changes too
where are you  christmas
do you remember
the one you used to know
i m not the same one
see what the time s done
is that why you have
let me go
christmas is here
everywhere
christmas is here
if you care
if there is love
in your heart and your mind
you will feel like christmas
all the time
i feel you  christmas
i know i ve found you
you never fade away
the joy of christmas
stays here in silence
fills each and every heart
with love
they re makin  noise
noise  noise  noise
how i hate their happy noise
there s only one thing i hate more
come to think of it
and that s the people who keep
makin  it
feast  feast  feast  feast
they ll have more
than anyone could ever eat
me  i m stuck here with my
cream of wheat
there s no one here to feast with me
on this lonely christmas eve
don t they know i m up here all alone
in my cave up in the hills
how i wish that this would go away
this dreadful holiday
that they call christmas day
it s a lonely christmas eve
the streets are filled
with christmas cheer
at least it s only once a year
perfect parcels tied with perfect bows
and carols ringing in my ear
bundled up against the cold
lines wherever gifts are sold
each shop window
displays a christmas scene
for everybody young and old
icicles on eaves troughs
and tinsel on the tree
but it s a green christmas for me
couples skating on the pond
makin  angels on the lawn
five red mittens drying on the rack
and needle shedding tannenbaum
red bows on the railings
and snowflakes on the ground
but it s a green christmas in this town
green
 cause of everything i miss
all this mistletoe  no kiss
and with every christmas wish
there would be no greater gift
than to have this envy lift
carolers are at my door
don t wanna hear them anymore
stockings on the mantel
