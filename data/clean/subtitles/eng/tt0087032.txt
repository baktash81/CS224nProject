from the very beginning until now 
have ruled the desert
with one thing     speed   
our ants run faster than others 
we spend money faster than others 
now  from the ground   
suddenly   
our planes fly faster than others 
we have the fastest boats
and the fastest cars
except for one 
it is you 
last year i sent you
to race the cannonball run
to let people know about
the falafel family 
the fastest family in the world 
we could have won 
but you guit during the race 
a thousand thanks 
please listen to me 
we drove too fast 
and that caused a flat tire 
  father 
  stop explaining 
you have already disgraced
the falafel family 
a thousand thanks 
do you have a blonde slave
for any special reason 
don t underestimate him 
prior to becoming a slave 
he was a hotshot on tv 
that s right 
two thousand thanks 
if it weren t for my ulcer 
i would have won the last time 
the worst part is   
i order you to return to america
to win the cannonball run 
the problem is none of us
has a driver s license 
otherwise  i wouldn t ask you 
but father 
there s no cannonball run this year 
no race  then organize one 
i know what to do 
someone is speeding 
someone really has guts
but no regard for life 
i m not sure about that 
the ticket s going to be expensive 
  here they come 
  we have to chase them 
  speed limit  55 m p h   
  speed limit  155 m p h   
this car is really fast 
a white car is coming at you
in about 3 seconds 
you re exaggerating 
right  there are two pretty girls
in the car 
this is a straight road 
how could we miss them 
calm down  look for dust and dirt 
it must be them 
we really have lost them 
the two girls are driving
a white lamborghini 
how could we have missed them 
really  we didn t see them 
i saw it 
this time  we won t lose them 
don t get cocky 
we ll split up 
they won t get away 
let s do it 
i m heading south east 
chasing a white lamborghini 
be on the lookout 
thank you 
did i have too much drink or what 
the white lamborghini is gone 
but here comes a red one 
that isn t right 
there are two more girls speeding 
it s boring racing with them 
the cannonball run is much better 
right  there s a cannonball run
this year 
why don t we compete race 
it must be exciting 
  what are we waiting for 
  let s go 
ladies and gentlemen 
welcome to the human cannonball show 
get ready to be thrilled
by a brave performer 
this stunt pushes human ability
to its limit 
this is a record breaking event
that defies death 
it s a gamble of life 
j j   is this going to work 
it ll work 
  we re going to be rich 
  rich    
we re going to split
all the money in half 
we re partners 
  you perform and i get the money 
  that s fair 
  you won t go wrong with me 
  because we re partners 
my part is more dangerous 
don t be a chicken 
the pilot is very experienced 
  he can do it with his eyes closed 
  closed eyes 
don t be afraid 
he ll drop you gently 
  then you ll go through that 
  go through what 
  go through a net  it s very safe 
  really 
there s hay behind it 
if you don t catch the net 
you ll wind up as a scarecrow 
what if it doesn t work 
  it s not dangerous 
  i m very calm 
  have some confidence 
  right 
if you have confidence 
i won t be worried 
good luck 
  j j   i m still scared 
  scared 
if you are scared 
then change into captain chaos 
everything will be fine 
captain chaos only appears
when human life is in grave danger 
right  ask him to come 
hello  this is jack smith 
we brought our camera
to report
to our viewers
who will witness a stunt
called the human cannonball 
a human bomb will be dropped
at 140 m p h 
if he is lucky 
he will become a national hero 
his face will not only be seen
on magazine covers 
but millions of adoring women
will be at his feet 
he will be surrounded by women 
clumsy oaf 
j j   long time no see 
you look great 
i think i d better take your place 
l ll do it  we re good partners 
it s better if i take your place 
  really 
  right 
then go ahead 
thank you

he s in grave danger 
drinking beer is better

lced cold beer   with chicken wings   
let me take a sip to wake myself up 
what s the matter 
i want to go down 
that s easy  watch me 
don t blink  the human cannonball

if we perform this ten times a day
for about a year 
we ll be billionaires 
what 
the prize for the cannonball run
is a million dollars 
it s just a small amount 
it s nothing 
a lottery prize is more than this

i just want you to be rich 
i want to discuss something
at this meeting today 
our family has had money
and power for a long time

drugs  racketeering 
and prostitution 
boss  you said prostitution twice 
i like it 
our business has gone down 
guys  who worked for us before 
work for other families 
they don t even consider us 
why is this 
it is because we re nice guys 
is the interest too high 
too many people emigrate 
none of the above

i didn t know we d be playing
a guessing game 
give us a hint 
last year  i passed my business
over to my son  don don

we have to discuss this 
  what are you doing 
  come over here 
what 
i think you overdid it

  i know 
  helping people is difficult 
it s a jinx to have nuns
come with us 
just do something good 
if we let them come with us 
we won t be able to pick up girls 
i know i m a womanizer 
but if they come with us   
  we can use them as shields

  that s good 
being a nun is a tough job 
my daughter

it s better to be a cop
when you re chased by one 
something s wrong 
miss  let me tell you 
we were disguised as priests before 
we didn t win 
disguising yourselves as nuns
won t do you any good 
that s why we re disguised as cops 
we can protect the ladies 
we can also search them 
that s great 
you really have guts 
they re real nuns 
you have to pay them respect 
watch yourself 
you solve your own problem 
everybody  come here

this is fun  did we make you horny 
especially when we got changed 
did you guys get horny 
it was all betty s idea 
we are always dressed up 
we didn t expect you to believe us 
we are very innocent 
we were afraid
that you would kick us out 
how could l 
we did it to make money 
who wouldn t want to 
let me kiss you 
i have been waiting for this
for a long time 
i hate giving out speeding tickets

a pretty girl suddenly appeared 
actually  it was nothing 
falafel was kidnapped 
and the money was robbed 
how did it happen 
a pretty girl wanted to hitch a ride 
being nice guys  we stopped the car 
  god knows   
  that is impossible 
no one knows
where the money was kept 
someone in this group
gave away the secret 
he is right  no one else knew
there was so much cash involved 
except us 
j j 
you two better talk 
  how 
  say it 
j j   this is simple 
we owe a casino for a small amount 
they were being cautious 
so they sent some collectors 
you told them the secret 
we didn t mean to 
who are they 
they are friends
of the godfather s son  don don 
we have to find them
and discuss this 
  that may work 
  it is not going to work 
why 
because the pinto ranch
is heavily guarded 
it is not easy to get in 
they can t scare us if i am here 
you  captain chaos  go in 
and you will end up not coming out 
what else can we do 
what is wrong 
why are there so many people 
we have to rescue the prince
as soon as we can 
he is probably fooling around
with some girls 
he is going to be drained 
i have a solution 
i can go to my old friend 
he is a bad guy 
it doesn t matter who he is
if he can help us 
he is waiting for you 
sit here 
every time you come here 
it is bad news 
  you are bright
