force field  called  glass  
it s what keep us so
toasty and warm in here 
while you guys are out

classy 
ara ara 
ara ara

doctor of ornithology 
ooh  he s magnificent 
linda  a little help here 
linda 
wow  you re actually communicating 
yes  i introduced myself and
shook my tail feathers 
counter clockwise 
thus referring to his dominance 
i did not get that at all 
so  dr monteiro 
no dr  please  just call me tulio 
you know your macaw
is a very special bird 
in fact  as far as we know 
blu is the last male of his kind 
really 
  yes 
recently we found a female 
and our hope is to bring the two
of them together to save their species 
well sure  when can she come over 
oh  no  she is in brazil 
blu must come to rio de janeiro 
rio  brazil 
oh  no  no  no  no 
i never let blu out of my sight 
he needs me 
oh no 
you misunderstand 
it s all arranged  you ll be
with him every step of the way 
and i ll be with you 
look  i know you re doing your job 
but    well  blu s very particular   
and we have our little routine here
and we re not big on travel 
heck  he doesn t even fly 
of course he can fly 
he s a perfect specimen 
what are you doing 
don t worry  their natural
instincts always take over 
wait  no 
well  almost always 
blu 
what kind of doctor are you 
are you okay 
perhaps he s too domesticated 
it was very nice of you to step in 
squawk around and throw my bird 
but now it is time for you to go 
i m very sorry 
i m very sorry  but wait  linda 
this could be our last chance 
have a safe flight 
linda  please listen to me 
if we don t do this 
his whole species will be gone 
just think about it 
natural instincts 
there is nothing natural about being
thrown half way across the room 
hah  i ll show him 
i can do this 
i just have to work out the physics 
i have quadrated my vector angles 
i have adjusted for wind shear 
house every reinforcement 
good

landing gear  checked 
tail flaps  operational

okay  i had nothing to do with that 
but  it s actually a pretty good song 
 naturally     yes  sing it lionel

besides  he s got jewel 
help me 
this is the final countdown to carnival

i wouldn t expect a pet to understand 
pet 
did you just call me a pet 
for the record  i am not a pet 
i am a companion 
and you know what 
do what you want 
cause  tomorrow morning
linda will come for me 
and this whole nightmare will be over 
incredibly  you rather be with a human
than with your own kind 
well  that human has given me love
and affection for the past 15 years 
whereas my own kind tries
to strangle me after 15 seconds 
yah  it s because of them 
i ve lost everything 
you can t trust them 
of course  you can trust humans 
jewel 
jewel 
hi there 
it s nice of you to join me for dinner 
i often eat alone 
because of my work 
i thought i was the  bird mad 
until i met you 
yes  right 
do you have a favorite bird 
well  obviously
i m a blue macaw kind of gal 
that makes sense 
they are very handsome birds 
actually  it s the brains i m attracted to 
i m not so impressed by fancy feathers 
i know exactly 
what you mean 
my favorite bird is the spotted owl 
i ve always been mesmerized by those big 
round intelligent eyes 
chicken rolls 
lambada 
chicken eyes 
oh gosh 
hello 
oh  blu 
we should have never left 
this is all my fault 
  no linda  please 
this is not your fault 
you re right 
it s not my fault 
  it s your fault 
  what 
with your little bird talk 
and that whole   
well  you know what 
squawk squawking is squawk squawk 
i am sorry 
i didn t mean to curse 
i don t understand 
sylvio is the best guard in the business 
so let me get this straight 
you were attacked
by a little white bird 
yes  with this rag he held it
to my mouth  like this 
we re doomed 
okay  there s no place like home 
there s no place like home 
how i wish i was back in my cage
with my mirror and my swing
and my little bell 
how i miss my little bell 
  ssshh  play dead 
what  i don t need to play dead 
i m about to have a heart attack 
just do it 
  fine 
stop twitching 
  come on  it s the twitching that sells it 
come on in  kid 
well  what do you know 
good work  fernando

that you are going to pay him
half as much as what you said

ambitious feet to beak

oh  and malicious 
i had it all  tv shows  women too 
i was tall  over 1 foot 2  
then they got a pretty
parrot to fill my shoes 
that s why i am so evil

this is where our kind naturally lives 
hey  don t talk to me about nature 
i watch animal planet 
i know all about the food chain 
you see  out here
i m just a hors d oeuvre 
nothing more than a feathery spring roll 
that is why we stay on the trees
and not on the ground 
after you 
oh no  i don t think so 
i ll feel much more comfortable
in something man made 
how about up there 
i can t believe i ve to drag
your clumsy butt up there 
drag me 
watch and learn 
blu  just wait 
who s dragging who s butt now  huh 
ha  ha very funny 
you see  who needs flying 
birds  birds need flying 
flying is    freedom
and not having to rely on anyone 
don t you want that 
i don t know 
sounds a little lonely 
let s get some sleep

luiz 
you don t fool me for a second 
you and your amigos just want
to sneak off to carnival 
oh carnival 
that magical time when i met
the most beautiful bird in the world 
i still remember the song that was
playing when i first laid eyes on you 
 tall and tanning  young and lovely  
 the girl from ipanema goes walking  
come on baby  sing it 
 and when she passes 
 each one she passes goes  aah     
like a river of the sweetest honey 
i guess love is deaf too 
come here  mmm 
okay  take them to luiz 
but hurry back 
you are an angel 
i ll miss you  my juicy little mango 
oh me too  my pouchy papaya 
hey  paco  carlos 
put your brother down  now 
i can t believe she actually let me go 
so how far is this luiz 
not far  30 minutes says the crow flies 
and how long does the macaw walks 
bobo here can t fly 
but he s a bird 
  not all birds fly 
there are ostriches   
  you re not an ostrich 
well  not technically 
  wait  wait  wait   
my friends  i want to help you 
but to walk the whole way 
it   it can t be done 
  where s daddy    
daddy  daddy 
but hey  we might as
well give it a shot 
let s go  quickly 
no  don t back 
they sense fear 
what an adorable monkey 
hey  my watch 
hello boys 
seems like you had a busy day 
oh  what  this 
this is just some stuff we found 
right boys 
i m not interested in
your nicked knickknacks 
your burgle bobbles bore me 
there are two blue macaws out there 
and i need your multitude
of vice to help me find them 
oh yes  what s in it for us 
that s a fair question 
let s discuss it 
i certainly see your point 
but what could i possibly
do for you in return 
save me  save me 
oh  that s a thought 
this is enough 
i don t want to feel
like i m cheating you 
we ll do it  we ll do it 
save me  please 
save me 
alright  you twisted my wing 
deal 
now then  any more questions 
no  good 
you ll spread out and find these
macaws by the end of the day 
or it s flying lessons for everyone 
go 
go do your monkey business 
i changed my mind 
maybe we can find a bus
schedule or something 
come on  you are not
going to back out now 
not in front of a lady 
okay  yes     sure 
all right  that s the spirit 
you sure you re up for this 
i mean it s not like we re hurdling
ourselves off the mountain or something 
right 
actually that was pretty
much my entire plan 
what 
don t worry blu 
it s in your dna 
and if our featherless friends
can do it  how hard can it be 
help me 
fun right 
yeah  fun 
okay  i need you
two to get closer 
closer 
closer 
nice 
now  put your wings
around each other 
what 
come on amigos 
not that she s going to bite 
will you 
  we ll see 
now  you flap your right wing
and you flap your left wing 
and together  you fly 
this doesn t seem
aerodynamically possible 
you think too much 
flying is not what you think up here 
it s what you feel in here 
and when you feel the
rhythm of your heart 
it s like samba 
you fly 
see  it s easy 
easy 
easy for you to say because
from here  it looks really hard 
hey  if want to see linda again 
this is the only way 
okay  you re right
