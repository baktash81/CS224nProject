shook my tail feathers
counterclockwise
thus referring to his dominance
i did not get that at all
so dr monteiro
no dr please just call me tulio
you know your macaw
is a very special bird
in fact as far as we know
blu is the last male of his kind
really
yes
recently we found a female
and our hope is to bring the two
of them together to save their species
well sure when can she come over
oh no she is in brazil
blu must come to rio de janeiro
rio brazil
oh no no no no
i never let blu out of my sight
he needs me
oh no
you misunderstand

hes a perfect specimen
what are you doing
dont worry their natural
instincts always take over
wait no
well almost always
blu
what kind of doctor are you
are you okay
perhaps hes too domesticated
it was very nice of you to step in
squawk around and throw my bird
but now it is time for you to go
im very sorry
im very sorry but wait linda
this could be our last chance
have a safe flight
linda please listen to me
if we dont do this
his whole species will be gone
just think about it
natural instincts
there is nothing natural about being
thrown half way across the room
hah ill show him
i can do this
i just have to work out the physics
i have quadrated my vector angles
i have adjusted for wind shear
house every reinforcement

i am a companion
and you know what
do what you want
cause tomorrow morning
linda will come for me
and this whole nightmare will be over
incredibly you rather be with a human
than with your own kind
well that human has given me love
and affection for the past 15 years
whereas my own kind tries
to strangle me after 15 seconds
yah its because of them
ive lost everything
you cant trust them
of course you can trust humans
jewel

the most beautiful bird in the world
i still remember the song that was
playing when i first laid eyes on you

and when she passes
each one she passes goes aah
like a river of the sweetest honey
i guess love is deaf too

your nicked knickknacks
your burglebobbles bore me
there are two blue macaws out there
and i need your multitude
of vice to help me find them
oh yes whats in it for us
thats a fair question
lets discuss it
i certainly see your point
