 young woman 
i m thinking of ending things 
once this thought arrives  it stays 
it sticks  it lingers  it dominates 
there s not much i can do about it 
trust me 
it doesn t go away 
it s there whether i like it or not 
it s there when i eat  when i go to bed 
it s there when i sleep  when i wake up 
it s always there  always 
i haven t been thinking about it for long 
the idea is new 
but it feels old at the same time 
when did it start 
what if this thought
wasn t conceived by me 
but planted in my mind  pre developed 
 inhales 
is an unspoken idea unoriginal 
maybe i ve actually known all along 
maybe this is how
it was always going to end 
jake once said 
 sometimes the thought
is closer to the truth 
to reality  than an action 
you can say anything  you can do anything 
but you can t fake a thought  
the road is mostly empty 
it s quiet around here  vacant 
more so than anticipated 
so much to see  but not many people 
not many buildings or houses 
sky 
trees  fields  fences 
the road and its gravel shoulders 
 you wanna stop for a coffee  
 i think i m ok i say 
 last chance we ll have
before it becomes really farm y  
i m visiting jake s parents
for the first time 
or i will be when we arrive 
jake  my boyfriend 
he hasn t been my boyfriend for very long 
it s our first trip together 
 inhales  our first long drive 
so it s weird that i m feeling nostalgic 
about our relationship 
about him  about us 
 inhales deeply 
i should be excited 
looking forward to the first of many 
but i m not  not at all 
i ve seen more barns on this drive
than i ve seen in years 
maybe in my life 
they all look the same 
some cows  some horses  sheep  fields 
and barns 
such a big sky 
feels like i ve known jake
longer than i have 
what has it been 
oh  a month 
six weeks  maybe seven 
 inhales  i should know exactly 
i ll say seven weeks 
 man s voice speaking indistinctly 
 man  the assumptions are right 
i can feel my fear growing  now is the   
 young woman  we have a real connection 
a rare and intense attachment 
i ve never experienced anything like it 
 man   growing  now is the time
for the answer  just one question 
one question to answer 
it s snowing 
winter is comin  in 
yep 
 young woman laughing 
look at the sky 
 bird cawing 
 young woman 
i m thinking of ending things 
  huh 
  what 
did you say something 
 chuckling  no  i don t think so 
weird 
  yeah 
   jake inhales deeply 
 young woman 
i m thinking of ending things 
what s the point in carrying on like this 
i know what it is  where it s going 
jake is a nice guy  but   
it s not going anywhere 
i ve known this for a while now 
maybe it s human nature to keep going
in the face of this knowledge 
the alternative requires too much energy 
decisiveness 
hmm 
people stay in unhealthy relationships
because it s easier 
basic physics 
an object in motion
tends to stay in motion 
people tend to stay in relationships
past their expiration date 
it s newton s first law of emotion 
do you want to stop for a coffee
or something  a    a snack 
it s    it s going to get pretty farm y
  pretty fast now 
  no  no  no  i m    i m fine 
  you sure 
   young woman  mm hmm 
don t want to spoil my appetite 
 slight chuckle 
 chuckles 
ok
 theme music playing 
 audio from mr  peabody and sherman
on television 
 slurping 
 faucet running 
 swing squeaking 
you know  my mother hasn t been
feeling well recently 
  oh 
   jake  so   
i m sorry 
i m just saying
that there might not be much of a spread 
that she might not be up to
a lot of cooking 
um   
  she hasn t been well 
  what s going on with her 
just saying  if you want
to stop for a snack
or anything like that 
it would probably be fine   
um   
in terms of appetite spoiling 
it might even be advisable 
 slight chuckle 
i m fine 
ok
   turns on radio 
   man on radio  come  join me  my friends 
and accept jesus into your hearts 
for as isaiah 1 18 tells us 
though your sins be as scarlet 
they shall be as white as snow 
they really are looking forward
to meeting you 
i don t want to give you
the wrong impression 
  aww  that s nice to hear 
   jake     a lot about you 
yeah  i i i m    i m   
i m really looking forward
to meeting them too 
 young woman  maybe it s unfair of me
to be going on this trip with jake 
when i m so uncertain about our future 
our lack of it 
after all  going to meet
your boyfriend s parents
is the proverbial next step  isn t it 
the truth is  i haven t even
told my parents i m dating jake 
i ve never mentioned him 
and i don t think i ever will 
she hasn t been feeling well 
getting old ain t for sissies 
as bette davis said 
 jake  true  although   
one might just take issue
with her use of the word sissy   
  yeah  of course  yeah  yes  sir 
   jake     as a pejorative 
it was a different time 
 young woman  i guess it s curiosity 
jake is certainly hard to figure 
maybe it s like a window into his origins 
the child being father of the man and all 
are you a fan of wordsworth  then 
  wordsworth 
   jake  william wordsworth  the poet 
um   
not    i m not familiar  really 
why do you ask 
just thinking about him for some reason 
   chuckles 
  he popped into my head 
 exhales 
his poem ode  intimations of immortality
from recollections of early childhood 
  jesus  that s the title 
   jake chuckles 
   chuckles  sounds like an entire poem 
  well 
   young woman  i m thinking of   
  get your words  worth with wordsworth 
 imitates gunshot  fired 
do you want to hear how it starts 
  it s just that the   
  i m not a metaphorical type gal 
it s just that that one speaks to me 
uh  incidentally  wordsworth wrote
a series of poems to a woman named lucy 
like me 
a beautiful  idealized woman
who dies young 
oh  yikes 
well  the comparison goes
only as far as your name 
phew 
 jake  and that you are ideal 
  of course 
  yeah  yeah   inhales sharply 
ah  that s very sweet 
 cell phone rings 
 young woman  it s just 
 continues ringing 
who s that 
uh  it s just a friend 
i m not gonna answer 
  you can  i don t mind  you should 
  eh  it s ok
  it s all right 
  i don t mind 
 young woman chuckles 
 sighs 
that s odd  did you see that swing set
  we just passed 
  what swing set 
it was weird 
it was this beautiful new swing set
in front of an abandoned house 
  no  i missed it 
  what 
i didn t see it 
why would that be there 
i mean  clearly no one s lived
in that house for years 
someone s moving in  and   
they brought the swing set first 
that s all i can think of 
  i   
   young woman  that seems
like an unlikely sequence of events 
 exhales  you know  like 
to have something
to entertain the kids while the parents
are getting the house ready 
 exhales 
odd 
they re saying  uh 
  there might be a fair amount of snow 
  yeah 
they re predicting it 
do you think we should maybe turn back 
i ve got a fair amount of   
well  a lot  actually 
of work to do tomorrow 
i need to get home tonight so that i   
i think we ll be ok 
i ve got tire chains in the trunk 
  what are you working on 
  oh  i have a paper due wednesday 
which one is this 
susceptibility to rabies infection
in the sensory dorsal
root ganglia neurons 
the trigeminal ganglia as well  right 
yes  exactly 
 both chuckle 
point for me 
interested in and knowledgeable
about my girlfriend s work 
point for jake 
  how s the paper going 
  oh   
 sighs  it s nowhere actually 
i really do need to get back tonight 
deal with it first thing 
i ll get you home 
chains 
chains 
 young woman  yeah  i do like jake 
and he s educated 
our fields are different 
but he s curious and keeps up 
that s a good thing 
it s in the pro column 
and he s cute in his awkward way 
  we re interesting together too 
   giggles 
 young woman 
people look at us when we re together 
 who s that couple  
i don t get looked at alone 
and jake doesn t either 
jake tells me that he feels it 
feels invisible 
you want to listen to something 
 deep breath 
sorry  uh  what 
um   
i asked if you want to listen
to some music 
oh  yeah  sure 
 turns on radio 
 tuning radio 
when you get out this far 
there s not much signal 
  many a new day  plays 
 laughing 
it s an odd song 
 laughs  to   
  out here in    in the middle of nothing 
  it s from oklahoma 
the musical 
i didn t know you were a fan
of musical theater 
well  i m not  really 
anyway  i just know a few musicals uh   
oklahoma  phantom 
carousel  south pacific 
guys and dolls  flower drum song   
   laughs 
  wicked   
how to succeed in business
without really trying  music man 
pajama game  cabaret 
the lion king  grease 
the king and i  the sound of music 
pal joey  charley s aunt  on the town 
my fair lady 
but i know oklahoma best  i guess 
they do it every few years   
 inhales deeply 
for obvious reasons 
wait  who does it every few years 
sometimes i see kids
who were in past productions  you know 
um  at the supermarket 
working at stores in town 
 inhales deeply 
 exhales  older now 
 girl sings 
     fly  a kiss gone by is bygone  
  never have i asked an august sky  
  where has last july gone   
  many a new face will please my eye  
  many a new love will find me  
  never have i once looked back to sigh  
  over the romance behind     
this girl seems healthy enough
in her attitude 
good for her 
she    she s protesting too much 
it turns out 
we ve all been there 
 exhales 
where 
protesting too much
how ok everything is 
 inhales  that s why i like road trips 
it s good to remind yourself
the world s    larger
than the inside of your own head 
  you know 
  mm hmm 
 both  perspective 
 jake  perspective 
 young woman  it is beautiful out here 
in a bleak  heartbroken kind of way 
what was the last road trip i took 
hmm   
i should remember  but i don t 
nothing s coming to mind 
it s odd  i m foggy
about so many things lately 
do you like this type of landscape 
mmm 
yeah  it s beautiful 
it s melancholy 
i do like that 
 jake inhales deeply 
it s the poet in you 
 young woman chuckles 
yeah 
i suppose so 
maybe  i don t know 
you been working on anything 
uh  i i     clears throat 
i just finished something 
yeah  i don t    i don t know 
   jake  can i hear it 
  you can read it 
i like to hear them in your voice 
and you re so good at reciting them 
not really  but thanks 
it ll go with the poetic scenery 
 exhales  i don t know  jake 
i just don t   
i don t really feel much like performing
  right now 
  come on  it ll pass the time 
 inhales sharply 
i don t want you to get bored 
it s called  bonedog  
 wind whistling 
 coming home is terrible   
whether the dogs lick your face or not 
whether you have   
 inhales deeply 
a wife 
or just a wife shaped loneliness
waiting for you 
coming home is terribly lonely   
so that you think
of the oppressive barometric pressure
back where you have just come from
with fondness 
because everything s worse
once you re home 
you think of the vermin
clinging to the grass stalks   
 inhales 
long hours on the road 
roadside assistance and ice creams 
and the peculiar shapes of certain clouds
and silences
with longing 
because you did not want to return 
coming home is   
just awful 
and the home style silences and clouds
contribute to nothing
but the general malaise 
clouds  such as they are 
are in fact suspect
and made from a different material
than those you left behind 
you yourself were cut
from a different cloudy cloth 
returned 
remaindered 
ill met by moonlight 
unhappy to be back 
slack in all the wrong spots 
seamy suit of clothes 
dishrag ratty  worn 
 wind whistling 
you return home 
moon landed 
foreign 
the earth s gravitational pull 
an effort now redoubled   
 inhales deeply 
dragging your shoelaces loose   
 exhales 
and your shoulders 
etching deeper the stanza of worry
on your forehead 
you return home deepened 
a parched well linked to tomorrow
by a frail strand of   
anyway 
you sigh into the onslaught
of identical days 
one might as well  at a time 
well   
anyway 
you re back 
the sun goes up and down
like a tired whore 
the weather immobile like a broken limb
while you just keep getting older 
nothing moves  but the shifting tides
of salt in your body 
your vision blears 
you carry your weather with you 
the big  blue whale 
a skeletal darkness 
you come back
with x ray vision   
your eyes have become a hunger 
you come home with your mutant gifts
to a house of bone 
everything you see now 
all of it   
bone  
wow 
 young woman 
well  wow is an all purpose exclamation 
i just realized that   chuckles 
it might be    it can   
it can mean you    you loved it 
or it can mean there are no words
to describe how   
 sniffs     how rubbish it is 
i love it 
i love it  it s amazing 
it s    it s like   
it s like you wrote it about me 
oh  you know  i i i   
i guess that s what one hopes for
when writing a poem   sniffs 
 jake  what s that 
some universality in the specific 
i don t know 
it s like you wrote it about me 
 sighs 
 young woman 
i m thinking of ending things 
jake is really great 
he s really sweet 
he s sensitive 
and he listens to me  and he s smart 
but there s just something     sighs 
ineffable 
profoundly  unutterably 
un fixably wrong here 
 are you ok
 yeah 
you just seem sort of far away is all 
i m    just thinking 
   sniffs 
  about what 
 inhales deeply 
uh   
i don t know  just     exhales 
vague in my head stuff 
vague in your head stuff 
i guess i was thinking about time 
  really 
  yeah 
like we re on a train
and it takes us where it takes us 
there s no veering off 
there s no side trips 
and like mussolini s train 
it runs on time 
but that s not really true
about mussolini and trains 
the improvements
in the railway system preceded him 
he just took the credit 
and even still 
they didn t always run on time 
i wasn t really talking
about mussolini s train   
and anyway  you   
you can always jump off a train 
 young woman  in movies 
in real life  you ll probably die
jumping from a moving train   chuckles 
that s    that s very true 
i suppose i watch too many movies 
hmm  everybody does 
societal malady 
 jake  fill my brain with lies
to pass the time 
in the blink of an eye 
and an eye blink
in excruciatingly slow motion 
 young woman  it s like the rabies virus 
attaching itself to our ganglia 
changing us into itself 
viruses are monstrous 
everything wants to live  jake 
 inhales 
viruses are just one more example
of everything 
but   
even fake  crappy movie ideas
want to live 
like  they grow in your brain 
replacing real ideas 
that s what makes them dangerous 
but  did you know   
there are insects that blow themselves up 
  yes 
  not everything wants to live 
there are certain ants  certain aphids 
for the good of their community 
there are suicide bombers 
 scoffs 
 pig  come   
join me 
so not everything wants to live 
right 
true  well  they   
they want their communities to live 
which is sort of like themselves 
writ large 
anyway  we don t really know
if they want anything 
it s just most likely
how they re programmed 
maybe we re all programmed  right 
 sighs 
 imitates explosion sound 
and now we re both dead 
 jake  ta da 
 wind whistling 
 wind howling 
so  uh  i m not    i m not ready to go in 
i i need to stretch my legs  long legs 
long drive 
what  what  isn t that rude 
she clearly knows we re here 
we ve been waving at each other for   
quite a long time 
they know i like to stretch my legs 
come on  i ll show you around 
jake  i don t know 
it s    it s    it s    it s cold
  and it s getting dark 
  come on 
come on  i ll give you the abridged tour 
 young woman groans 
 jake  maybe  we ll   
come back in the spring 
and we can lie out here
and look up at the universe 
 window creaking open 
the sheep 
 lamb bleats 
 sheep bleats 
  let s say hi 
   sheep bleating 
  hi  sheep 
  hi  sheep 
 young woman  there is something
dreary and sad in here 
and it smells 
i wonder what it must be like
to be a sheep 
spend one s entire life in this miserable 
smelly place doing nothing 
  eating  shitting  sleeping   
   sheep bleats 
  over and over 
   jake  well  there you have it 
 sheep bleats 
  the sheep 
   lamb bleats 
   young woman  what happened to the lambs 
   jake  what 
   sheep bleats 
  what will happen   
i don t know what you re asking me 
they re already dead  so wh   
what else can happen to them 
  well  i mean  will they be buried 
  probably be burned
  come spring 
   sheep bleats 
but they re frozen solid for now 
so they re fine 
 wind howling 
no worries 
come on  i ll show you the    the old pen
where we used to keep the pigs 
   sheep bleats 
  they had to put them down 
that s too bad 
   jake  rotten situation  the pigs 
life isn t always pretty on a farm 
something you should know 
 lamb bleating 
so what    what happened to them 
  to the pigs 
   lamb bleats 
 lamb bleats 
forget it  uh  i don t think
you d like the story 
can t do that  you have to tell me now 
  yeah 
  yes  jesus 
 jake  ok  well   
um   
   lamb bleats 
  my dad hadn t been in
to check on the pigs for a few days 
my parents were busy 
he d just tossed their food into the pen 
but after a few days 
he noticed that they were all just lying
in this corner all the time 
so he went in to check on them 
they didn t look well 
he decided he d better try to move them 
and they re heavy 
they re pigs  right 
but yeah  he    he finally managed
to move one  and discovered   
its entire underside
was filled with maggots 
both pigs were being eaten alive 
 wind howling 
 deep breath 
life can be brutal on a farm 
should we go inside  it s getting cold 
 young woman  everything has to die 
that s the truth 
one likes to think
that there is always hope 
that you can live above death 
and it s a uniquely human fantasy
that things will get better 
born perhaps of the uniquely
human understanding that things will not 
there s no way to know for certain 
but i suspect humans are the only animals
that know the inevitability
of their own deaths 
   cart creaking 
  other animals live in the present 
humans cannot 
so they invented hope 
hello 
hello 
i m here 
we re here 
hello 
hello 
it s jake 
hello 
hello 
   dad  we ll be right down 
   jake  ok
so   
do you want slippers 
  i   
  floors are cold here 
  old houses  will you hold this  please 
  yeah 
yeah  thanks  i think 
 jake  um   
they ll be big on you 
they re my old ones  but they are warm 
  ah  voilà 
   giggling 
  none for you 
  no 
no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
you should have these 
  these are yours 
  oh  no 
what kind of gentleman
would that make me 
my slippers are your slippers 
  you sure 
  i am 
 jake speaking spanish 
 young woman laughs 
 jake  um  have a seat 
 floorboards creaking 
they ll be right down 
music 
sure 
 instrumental music playing 
 instrumental music continues 
 shoe squeals 
 coughs 
 instrumental music continues 
so  the    the bedrooms are upstairs 
not much else  um   
 inhales deeply 
my mom s sewing room 
bedroom  linen closet 
um   
i can show you after we eat 
  if you d like 
   chuckles 
it s not fancy 
as you can see 
it s nice  i like it 
  yeah 
   young woman  yes 
reminds me of the house i grew up in 
 jake inhales deeply 
i suppose all farmhouses are alike 
like all happy families 
i m not sure tolstoy got that one right 
happiness in a family
is as nuanced as unhappiness 
well  i think he was
talking about marriage   
ah  here they come 
i ll just get a fire going
in the meantime 
 jake lights match 
 whispers  your parents knew
we were coming  right 
i mean  they invited us and all   
invitation sounds a little formal
for my family 
but yeah  of course 
we communicated 
 young woman  ok  cool 
 fire crackling 
 young woman  hmm 
this fire feels good 
cozy 
  what s in there 
  the basement 
 young woman  oh 
i see 
we keep it closed off  mostly 
 cause old houses tend to be   
drafty 
right   inhales 
anyway   
the basement is unfinished 
a hole in the ground  really 
a hole in the ground 
just  water heater  washer and dryer 
stuff like that 
we don t use it really for anything else 
  ok 
  so  it s a waste of space 
i hate the basement  if you   
really want to know 
you have intense feelings about it 
 stammers  you   
you know  when you re a kid 
uh  basements are scary 
well  we didn t have one
growing up in an apartment 
but watching those scary movies 
you get the idea 
 chuckles 
 low voice 
don t look down in the basement 
 laughs 
oh  whoa 
 both laughing 
exactly   laughs 
 young woman laughs 
he s hiding in there  shh 
  who 
  what 
um   
what are those scratches on the door 
 jake inhales 
dog  from the dog  mostly 
i   
i love dogs 
 jake chuckles 
i didn t know your parents have a dog 
i usually can tell when there s a dog
in someone s house 
  toys lying around  and   
  my folks are tidy 
well  where is it  what   
what kind  what s its name 
so many questions  uh  jimmy 
he s a border collie 
  probably outside  or   
   gasps 
oh  hi  jimmy 
hi 
 jimmy panting 
oh  he s all wet   chuckles 
 softly growling and whimpering 
  that s   
  ah  here they come 
 laughing  oh 
oh 
 smooches 
aww 
was the drive ok 
yeah  fine 
 mother  oh 
  so glad to meet you  louisa 
   young woman  oh 
 mother  jake has told us
so much about you 
 young woman  oh  he s told me so much
about both of you too   chuckles 
oh  and you came anyway 
 laughing 
hi 
well  let s eat  all the food
will be as cold as a witch s tit
in a brass brassiere 
 laughing 
  oh  it smells great 
   mother  i hope you re hungry 
all homemade  everything you see
on the table is from the farm 
 inhales 
looks lovely 
so     exhales 
jake tells us you re a painter 
yes  jake tells you correctly 
i don t really know much about art 
but i like pictures where you know
what you re looking at 
what s it called  uh  abstract 
i don t get that 
i could do abstract  smear some paint on 
what s it called 
canvas  i think it s a con job
if you ask me 
i like paintings
that look like photographs 
i couldn t do that in a million years 
that is talent 
why    why not just take a photograph 
dad  if you like photographs 
it s much quicker  and photographs look
exactly like photographs 
i like photographs 
mostly sports photographs 
 mother  what kind of paintings
do you make  lucy 
uh  well  i i m not an abstract artist 
so that s in my favor 
good  you see  that s exactly my point 
you see  good 
i i do mostly landscape 
like outside paintings 
uh  yes  mm hmm  plein air 
which is outdoor painting   chuckles 
i try to capture the feel
of light and atmosphere 
that sounds lovely 
  jake used to paint too  of course 
  mom 
  he worked really hard at it 
  aww 
i didn t know that 
  he was very good 
   jake  mom 
aww 
i try to imbue my work with a sort of   
interiority 
interiority  so you paint   
  inside 
   young woman  well  inside my head 
so a landscape would attempt to express
how i feel at that time 
lonely  joyous  worried  s sad 
that sounds very interesting 
like that painting of that girl 
sitting in a field  looking at a house 
christina s world  wyeth 
  yes  exactly 
   laughing 
but without people 
uh   
how can a picture of a field be sad
without a sad person
looking sad in the field 
that s an interesting problem 
i   
yeah  i i i i   
i    i struggle with that 
 laughs 
uh   
well  i have some pictures of my work 
if you d like to see them 
 wind whistling 
oh  yes 
  yeah 
  yes 
   mother  yes 
   young woman  yeah 
uh   
these here 
 father  mmm 
mmm 
mmm 
ah 
mmm  ah 
mmm  i mean  they re pretty 
but i don t see how it s supposed
to make me feel something
if there s not a person in them
feeling something 
if there s not a person in them
feeling sad or joyous
or whatever other emotion you said 
well  m maybe think of yourself
as the person looking out at the scene 
i d have to see me in them 
well  if you were there 
you wouldn t see yourself  right 
well  i would if i looked down 
i m not a ghost 
  yet 
  i can attest to that   chuckles 
especially in the bedroom 
 giggling 
 stammering  i mean  but if you were there
looking out at it without looking down 
you d    you d see the scene
and you d feel something 
anything an environment makes you feel
is about you 
not the environment  right 
none of   
none of the feeling
is inherent to the place 
 father  uh  that s over my head  i guess 
they are pretty  though 
you re very talented   chuckles 
  thank you 
  i like the colors 
thanks 
psst  jake  you didn t tell us
your girlfriend was so talented 
i did  actually 
 laughing 
anyway  uh     clears throat 
i mean  sometimes i   
i would ve thought   
mmm   
because   
 wind whistling 
uh  so   
 clears throat  jake   
tells me you re studying quantum psychics
at the university 
  yes 
  physics 
  really 
  yeah 
that s unusual for a girl  isn t it 
yes  it is  actually 
i m just asking 
 stammers  a little less so these days 
which i think is a good thing 
 mother  well  after seventh grade 
i couldn t understand
what jake was saying 
so it s wonderful he has someone
he can share all his ideas with 
jake tells us there s been lots of famous
husband and wife physicists 
  ooh   laughs 
  dad 
 wind whistling 
yeah   chuckles 
 stammers  i guess there have been some 
uh  pierre and marie curie
shared a nobel prize in physics 
well  even i ve heard of them 
well  i ve heard of her anyway  radiation 
  uh  radioactivity 
  radium 
  yes 
  i am so glad jake has found someone 
 giggling 
won t you please tell us the story
of how you met 
jake has refused 
i love romantic meeting stories 
like in forget paris 
  billy crystal 
  i didn t like that movie 
billy crystal is a nancy 
um   
 wind whistling 
so     laughs 
uh   
i went with a friend
to a bar near campus  and   
it turned out to be trivia night 
oh  i love this so far 
jake is crazy about trivia 
we used to play
the genius edition of the   
  we used to play the genius edition   
  genus 
  we used to play the genius edition   
  genus 
 mother   of trivial pursuit  what 
it s genus edition 
oh  i always thought the word was genius 
i ve been saying it wrong all these years 
goes to show  i m no genus 
 both laughing 
that s a good one 
 jake  no  no  no 
 wind whistling 
genus is not   
the same as genius 
a genus is a category 
i always thought
it was the genius edition 
i told everyone he knew every answer
in the genius edition 
i was very proud of that   laughs 
  why didn t we get the genius   
   yells  there is no   
 jake breathing heavily 
  genius edition 
  ok 
 wind howling 
 inhales  so  jake was
with his trivia team 
and my friend and i
found an empty table near him 
and i was watching him 
  because you thought he was cute 
   young woman laughing  yeah  i did 
and he was very serious about the game 
which i found  i don t know  charming 
and    oh  his team was called   
  brezhnev s eyebrows 
  brezhnev s eyebrows  right 
   inhales 
   young woman  i asked who brezhnev was 
basically so i could say something to him 
and he told me
that brezhnev was a soviet engineer 
 stammering  and a general of the   
  uh  the section head of   
  secretary of the communist party 
during the age of starvation 
  stagnation 
   young woman  stagnation 
anyway  those team names
drive me nuts usually 
they all have the most teams show offy 
but i don t know  it didn t
bother me so much with jake 
i guess i didn t let it
because i thought he was cute 
aw  he is cute  isn t he   laughs 
so i i i was trying to get up the nerve
to talk to him  because   
even though he looked over at me
more than once 
it was clear he wasn t gonna say anything 
 stammers  i thought you said
you were talking about brezhnev 
 wind howling 
uh   
yes  that s true 
but we didn t talk anymore after that 
i guess is what i meant 
oh 
so i said something stupid  like 
 you guys seem to be doing well  
 laughs 
 giggles 
and i had to practically yell it 
it was so noisy 
and jake    jake raised his glass
and went   well  yeah 
well  we re helpfully fortified  
and i laughed  which broke the ice 
and i think he was egged on
by my laughing 
 cause he went on to tell me
that he was a cruc   
  verbalist 
   young woman  verbalist 
and i didn t know what that meant 
but i i didn t want to admit that 
so i just said 
   cool  
  cool 
and he was showing off again 
and poorly 
and i thought   this guy is awkward 
he has no game at all  
 inhales  and there was something
sort of appealing about that 
 wind whistling 
but then he kept going 
and he told me that he wanted
his team name to be ipseity 
and i was like   ugh  
you didn t like him anymore 
no 
i did 
 mother chuckles 
i just wanted that stuff to stop 
so i told him 
 you know i don t know that word 
why don t you just cut the crap  
 laughs 
and he said something like 
 i m an asshole  
 laughs 
 laughing hysterically 
 laughs 
 i m not very good at talking to people 
and ipseity is just another word
for selfhood  
 inhales  anyway  after that  he talked
like a normal person  and he was funny 
and i could see he wanted to ask
for my number 
but was shy 
and i was getting up to go 
my girlfriend wanted to leave 
and jake   
blurted out  could he have my number 
  oh 
   young woman laughs 
there you go    jake 
   young woman laughs 
  it s about time 
and the rest was history 
that was like   
six weeks ago 
god  feels longer 
 exhales

whisper 
oh  always 
yes 
as if i m constantly being whispered to 
 makes hissing sound 
maybe it s sharing the secrets
of the universe with me 
but i can t tell

maybe it s giving me stock market tips 
 laughs

 cell phone rings

 cell phone ringing 
it s just a friend 
  her friend calls a lot 
   mother  well  you can take it

we won t think it rude 
no  it s ok  it s not important 
you don t know  it might be 
it s a blizzard out there 
  she might be stranded 
  it s ok

we    we don t want to get stuck 
  stuck  stuck 
  it s ok  i ve got the chains

 laughing 
  you should take your call though 
  it could be an emergency 
it s fine 
i i i i   
  i know what she s calling about 
  you should at least listen to the message
ok 
 groans 
sure   chuckles 
 man s voice  there s only one question
to resolve 
i m scared  i feel a little crazy 
i m not lucid  how   
the assumptions are right 
i can feel my fear growing 
now is the time for the answer 
just one question 
one question to answer 
 wind whistling 
 sighs 
  she s fine 
  eh 
wh    what did she want 
oh  she was just calling to say hi 
 mother  how nice 
friends are important 
jake never really had a lot of them
growing up  or even after 
remember your 50th birthday 
  twentieth 
   mother  what did i say 
  fiftieth 
   jake  fiftieth 
oh   laughs 
goodness  where is my brain 
 laughing 
   wind howling 
   door shaking 
anyway 
friends can be helpful 
hmm  that s what i ve always found 
 cause life can be difficult 
on a farm 
doesn t get any easier
as it trudges along  i ll say that 
  what 
   father  doesn t get any easier 
   loudly  what doesn t 
   yells  life 
oh  no  it doesn t 
it s basically a fast train to hell 
for god s sake  mom 
all right  all right  yes 
i m overstating it  i agree 
it s a fast train to heck 
 mother and father laughing hysterically 
 mother continues laughing 
 trailing off as in pain 
your mother was always very funny 
 mother breathes shakily 
it s what i loved about her 
i think it s the   
the first thing that i fell in love with 
kind of    faded as she got older 
wears you down  i guess   chuckles 
it s not so funny anymore 
i miss her terribly 
yeah 
 wind whispering 
so  lucia   
is studying gerontology 
oh  really 
oh  how fascinating 
oh  fascinating 
yes 
i ve always been interested
in the problems associated with aging 
i think our society has an almost
repulsed relationship to the aged 
which is eminently foolish 
seeing that it s an inevitable and natural
part of the life cycle
of all living things 
not to mention it s terribly unkind 
oh 
how interesting 
and compassionate 
oh  we ve gotta keep her  jake 
oh  how kind she is 
 laughs 
 wind howling 
boy  it s  uh   
it s looking pretty bad out there 
i don t know  jake 
i i think we should probably   
 wind howling 
jake 
jake 
  jake 
   jake  what 
 young woman 
i i i i think we should go 
it s looking pretty bad 
 jake  i have chains 
 rattling 
 softly growling and whimpering 
where are you 
   jake  upstairs 
  i m coming up 
just letting you know 
 wind howling 
jake 
 wind howling intensifies 
jake 
where are you 
jake 
 door creaks open 
 young woman   coming home is terrible 
whether the dogs lick your face or not 
whether you have a wife or just
a wife shaped loneliness waiting for you 
  coming home is terribly lonely  
   gasps 
 breathing heavily 
sorry  you   
you scared me 
oh  i m sorry 
 breathing heavily 
this is   
jake s childhood bedroom 
yeah 
yeah  i i   
i saw the sign on the door 
oh  that 
how can i explain that 
my memory is going  um   
early signs of  uh   
 sighs 
uh   
alzheimer s 
dementia 
  lewy bodies   
  yeah  i think that s it 
we ve taken to   
labeling things
around the home 
you ll see labels all over the house 
i haven t noticed 
you will notice 
i m sorry to hear that y you re   
that s ok 
truth is   
i m looking forward
to when it gets very bad
and i don t have to remember
that i can t remember 
 laughs 
 mother cackling 
 father chuckles 
seems that that ll be a   
better way to  um   
oh  come on   chuckles 
  yeah 
  they say that every cloud has a   
 inhales deeply 
 sighs 
  a silver   
  silver  ah  that s it  exactly  silver 
they say that every cloud has a silver 
and  uh   
well  i believe that to be true 
oh 
this is jake s old room 
you two can stay in here tonight
if you want 
his mother and i aren t old fashioned
about that kind of thing 
fucking and whatnot 
oh  i   i    i have to get home tonight 
i have work in    in the morning 
i know this bed
looks a bit small for two  um   
oh  come on 
uh  uh  grown ups 
it s a child s bed  after all 
not even for twin children 
just for one child  i m sure
for a single night you could make do 
that s very generous of you  but i   
i i do have to   
i imagine you won t be doing
any fucking in this bed 
not really made for fucking 
it s a child s bed 
just for one child  not two 
right 
sure i can find
one of my wife s old  um   
oh 
 chuckles 
things for you to wear for tonight 
might have to dig through some trunks 
sure i can find one of my wife s
old things for you to wear 
for tonight  oh  look  there s   
jake s old room 
 chuckles 
 groans 
 gasps 
 fire crackling 
 mother groaning 
 young woman  jake 
 weakly  oh  it s the girlfriend 
open up 
jake  the snow  i need to leave 
i ve told him over and over
it s time for him to leave 
mom  you need to eat 
i ll be down in a minute 
mom 
jake s always been a good boy 
mom 
 mother  diligent 
 groans 
he won a pin 
maybe not as naturally talented
as some of the other students 
but   
he worked so hard 
and that s even more impressive 
being a genus   
genius  mom 
 mother  softly  genius 
the luck of the draw  really 
the genetic lottery  as they say 
but to do as well as jake did
with no special talent or abilities   
oh   breathing heavily 
that s much more impressive 
mm   
 young woman  yes 
  maybe you should   
   yells  soon 
ok 
we will leave soon 
let me just finish up here 
 wind howling 
 grunting 
 grunting and groaning 
 wind howling intensifies 
 jake  mom 
 young woman  i m impressed
with your attentiveness to your mom 
it s rare 
we tend to warehouse our elderly 
it s really special
how devoted a son you are 
i m glad to hear you say that 
that makes me feel better 
sometimes it   
feels like no one sees
the good things you do 
 wind howling 
like you re just alone 
 whispers  i see it 
i ll wait downstairs 
give you some privacy 
i don t want to live in a warehouse 
 young woman  i should end this 
just end it 
i just make a clean break 
no lingering 
no waiting for things to get better 
you can only wait so long 
i don t even know who i am
in this whole thing anymore 
where i stop and jake starts 
i m a pinball  my emotional state
is bouncing all over the place 
jake needs to see me
as someone who sees him 
he needs to be seen 
and he needs to be seen with approval 
like that s my purpose
in all this  in life 
to approve of jake  to keep him going 
and he needs to see me as someone
whose approval of him is validated
because i m approved of by others 
 look at my girlfriend 
look at what i won 
she s smart  she s talented 
she s sensitive 
she can do this  she knows about that 
she made this  she cares about that  
let me just take him to the bathroom 
then we ll go 
 young woman  i need to end it 
is that the girl 
  yes  dad  louisa 
  oh   breathing heavily 
good 
i brought your mother s  uh   
nightgown 
for her 
that s     stammers 
very kind  i   
i have to go home tonight 
soon 
oh  i i    i don t understand 
what does she mean 
i don t know  dad 
  i can t tell 
   young woman  i have my shift tomorrow 
she s a waitress 
oh
 jake chuckles 
we   we met when she was serving me 
it s a sweet story 
i asked her about the   
 jake and young woman  santa fe burger 
 all chuckling 
i m feeling confused 
let s just get you to the bathroom 
we don t want another accident 
remember last night 
 mother  what s this old thing doing here 
i m not sure 
oh  my goodness it s filthy 
it s got jake s baby food on it 
what s it doing here 
 chuckles  i tell you 
i would misplace my own head
if it wasn t screwed onto my own head 
would you be a sweetheart and toss it
in the washer  i just started a load 
my hands are full picking up
all these darn toys 
jake would leave his head on the floor
if it wasn t screwed onto his own head 
 young woman  sure 
  where is it 
  in the basement 
i don t think jake wants me down there 
jake can be controlling 
you can t allow him to control you 
i think it s the other side of his type
of personality  this diligence thing 
he needs to control everything 
there s so many 
many things that make him nervous 
he keeps closing off more and more
of the world  it s a problem 
and the few people
he does have left in his life
need to follow all sorts of rules 
it really is a problem 
yes  i m probably to blame 
and all this guilt
causes me to feel obligated   
 sighs     to bend over backwards
to accommodate his every little whim 
it s a vicious cycle 
so what exactly are you saying to me 
 whispering  i m saying 
take the darn nightgown to the basement 
live dangerously 
 wind howling 
 inhales deeply  then grunts 
 jake  you    you sent her down 
 mother  to the washer 
 jake  mom  really 
 muffled  you don t have to do laundry
for my mom 
you re a guest 
and we    we    we ll get you
a clean nightgown for tonight 
  i don t mind 
   jake  well  we really need   
we really need to get on the road 
i could    i could use some help
with the chains 
right  i ll be up 
 wind whistling 
 tense music plays 
 washer running 
 water splashing 
 water splashing 
 young woman  it s tragic how few people
possess their souls before they die 
 nothing is more rare in any man  
says emerson 
 than an act of his own  
and it s quite true 
most people are other people 
their thoughts are
someone else s opinions 
their lives a mimicry 
their passions a quotation 
that s an oscar wilde quote 
 cell phone ringing 
 man s voice  there s only one question
to resolve 
i m scared  i feel a little crazy 
i m not lucid 
the assumptions are right 
i can feel my fear growing 
now is the time for the answer 
just one question 
one question to answer 
   closes door 
   breathing heavily 
 wind whistling 
oh  my god 
jake  is your mom   
 jake shushing 
  she s   
   shushing 
she s asleep 
 young woman  she s   
we should go 
it s getting treacherous 
are you certain she s all right 
out like a light 
it s a good time to go 
what about your dad 
he s   
 inhales deeply 
he s puttering somewhere 
the disposal s out again 
it was great to meet you 
it was great to meet you too 
thank you so much for your hospitality 
oh  you re welcome here any time  yes 
jake s a good boy  yes 
   young woman  yes 
  yeah 
a good man  i should say 
you agree 
yes 
ok then  well   
 wind howling 
 sniffles 
 deep breath 
   wind howling 
   chains rattling 
 young woman groans 
so 
did you like them 
uh  y yes  they re very nice 
 wind whistling 
really 
yes 
they can be a little pushy 
but they re basically decent people 
that was eminently clear 
they both loved you  by the way 
that s good  i m glad 
   jake  so smart  my mother said 
   slight chuckle  did she 
well  not to you  that would ve
made you uncomfortable 
but  um  when i was helping her
with the dishes 
 young woman  i don t remember jake
helping his mother with the dishes 
i feel uncertain about a lot
of what happened tonight  it felt like   
when you and dad were discussing   
 young woman  what 
when you and dad were discussing   
 young woman  it seemed
as if everything was slightly   
  tariffs 
  right  tariffs 
 jake inhales deeply 
yeah  i i do remember now 
i m a little fuzzy 
you did have a lot of wine 
he was thrilled to have someone
who knew the difference 
did i 
you did 
uh   
i don t think you noticed 
because he kept topping you off 
  did he 
   jake  yes  yes  yes 
 young woman  right 
i didn t notice that 
   jake  yeah 
   young woman  tricky 
 jake  makes it hard to keep count 
  it does 
  as i was saying   
all in all  i think everything   
 inhales deeply     went well 
i think it was a successful visit 
mm hmm  yes 
everyone got to know each other 
that s true  they re very nice 
  you liked them 
  yes 
 jake  they liked you  too 
i think that   
i think that s a good sign 
s sign 
sign 
sign is perhaps not the right word 
  the thing 
  oh 
 jake  the good thing 
  yeah 
   jake  good thing 
it s good when people you like 
like each other 
 young woman 
people like to think of themselves
as points moving through time 
but i think it s probably the opposite 
we re stationary 
and time passes through us 
blowing like cold wind 
stealing our heat 
  leaving us chapped and frozen 
  what are you thinking 
 young woman  i don t know  dead 
i feel like i was that wind tonight 
blowing through jake s parents 
seeing them as they were 
seeing them as they will be 
  seeing them after they re gone 
  what are you   
   young woman  when only i m left 
  what are you thinking 
 young woman  only the wind 
not much 
really 
i m tired  jake  the wine  i guess 
yes  you did have a lot 
yes 
it is a depressant  as you know 
of course i know 
i think it s important for people
to keep that in mind
before they make decisions
under its influence 
 blows raspberry 
 both laugh 
  a woman under the influence 
  amazing film 
i m not sure i agree 
 young woman sniffs 
i ve been watching that film over and over
for my essay due wednesday 
i felt  uh  a kinship
with mabel  i guess 
she s such a powerful 
horribly wronged character 
is she 
i think   
 inhales 
 exhales 
mabel longhetti is bombed out
because she s always trying
to please everyone 
so that she can be considered one more
victim heroine for the women s liberation 
but only by women liberationists
who are willing to accept
textbook spin offs as art 
the junoesque gena rowlands 
mrs  cassavetes  is a prodigious actress 
and she never lets go of the character 
i agree  i i thought she was
great in the role 
  seemed to me she    she encompassed   
   young woman  now at an indeterminate age
when her beauty has deepened
beyond ingenue roles 
rowlands can look old or young 
shades of expression
transform mabel longhetti from   
 stammers 
a radiantly flirtatious beauty
into a sad  sagging neighborhood drunk 
rowlands externalizes
schizophrenic dissolution 
mabel fragments before your eyes 
a three ring circus
might be taking place in her face 
rowland s performance is enough
for half a dozen tours de force 
a whole row of oscars  it s exhausting 
conceivably 
she is a great actress  but   
nothing she does is memorable 
because she does so much 
 inhales deeply 
 exhales 
it s the most transient
big performance i ve ever seen 
i guess i m unclear
what you mean by transient 
mabel tries to slash her wrist 
nick puts a band aid on the cut 
the idiot symbolism is enough
to make you want to hoot 
but this two hour and 35 minute movie
leaves you too groggy
to do more than moan 
details that are meant to establish
the pathological nature
of the characters surrounding mabel   
 stammers     and so show her isolation
become instead limp  false moments 
it s unclear whether the characters
are unconscious
or whether it s cassavetes
who s unconscious of what he s doing 
the children keep murmuring
that they love her 
there s no clue
as how to decipher that refrain 
are they coddling her 
reversing roles and treating her
like a child in need of reassurance 
or are they as unashamedly loving
as she is 
and what are    what are we to make
of nick the pulper s
constant assertations 
is assertations even a word 
  i thought it was assertions 
  they re both words  look it up 
what are we to make of nick the pulper s
constant assertations of love 
the    the movie is entirely tendentious 
it s all planned yet it isn t thought out 
 wind howling 
 jake inhales deeply 
 exhales 
i do see what you re saying 
you are certainly the expert
on things cinematic 
yeah 
i am 
 jake  i i guess i was just   
 inhales deeply 
taken in   
by the    the sympathy
that cassavetes showed for her 
i feel like maybe our society
lacks a certain kindness 
a certain willingness
to take in the struggles of others   
 stammers     struggling with  uh 
issues caused by   
 young woman  an alienating society 
i don t know 
uh  i guess 
yeah  it seems hopeless 
what does 
 jake sighs 
 jake  all of it  uh  everything 
like feeling old 
like your body is going 
your hearing  your sight 
you can t see  and you re invisible 
 inhales deeply 
and you ve made so many wrong turns 
the lie of it all 
  what is the lie of it all 
   jake  i don t know  that   
it s going to get better 
that it s never too late 
that     inhales 
god has a plan for you 
  that age is just a number 
  shut up 
that   
 inhales deeply 
it s always darkest
before the dawn  that 
every cloud has a fucking silver lining 
   deep breath 
   blows raspberry 
that there s   
  that there s someone for everyone 
   blows raspberry 
platitudes all 
 blows raspberry 
shut up  mabel  sit down  mabel 
 blows raspberry 
 blows raspberry 
and god never gives us
more than we can bear 
god s a good egg that way 
hey  do you want something sweet 
what do you mean 
  dessert 
  didn t we have dessert at your mom s 
i feel like there was
this huge cake thing  or   
 chuckles 
true 
i guess i m a sugar junkie 
 laughs 
i don t know 
 inhales deeply 
it might help me stay awake 
then definitely 
we need jake awake for a bit 
this is all so treacherous 
there s a tulsey town
just at the turn off up ahead 
 young woman  a tulsey town 
 laughs 
open now  in this  it s freezing 
  it is perfect weather for a brrr 
   laughs 
don t you think 
yeah  i guess it is 
  gettin  tulsey town  
 both    we re here to soft serve   
tulsey town 
huh 
jesus  i never thought of that before 
what do you suppose tulsey town is 
 jake  based on the clown   
 laughing 
i d say it s a circus town 
maybe like that place   
uh  where the sideshow folks go
during off season 
  ruled by the clown lady 
  ah 
well  yes  she wears a crown 
she has a   
  clown crown 
   laughs 
a benevolent and tolerant
ice cream clown queen 
   young woman laughs 
  made entirely of lactose 
she is lactose tolerant 
she s sweet but cold 
 young woman  like your mum 
 laughs 
what do you mean 
nothing  i don t know why i said that 
that just came out 
  did you think of my mother as cold 
   young woman  no 
uh  she was lovely  she really was 
 cause i don t   
subscribe to that 
the mother is the cause
of all psychological problems crap 
that s misogynistic claptrap 
freudian bullshit 
it is tempting   
to have someone to pin it on  though 
 chuckles 
pin what on 
all of it  why you feel a certain way 
why you are a certain way 
that s misogynistic claptrap 
freudian bullshit 
a person  an adult  has to 
at one point or another 
take responsibility for who they are 
don t you think 
  yeah 
  yes 
 young woman  mother s are people
with their own pain 
their own history of neglect and abuse 
yet  at one time or another 
during the 20th century  every fucking
childhood trait was blamed on them 
schizophrenia  autism 
narcissism  homosexuality 
not that homosexuality is akin
to any of those other things 
  uh  yeah  of course not 
  obviously 
saying that a mother is to blame
for her child s homosexuality
is to imply that homosexuality
is somehow negative 
i was just saying that when homosexuality
was considered a pathology
in the dsm before 1973 
a coddling mother
  was often seen as the culprit 
  right 
 jake inhales deeply 
 exhales 
it s despicable how we label people
and categorize them and dismiss them 
  sighs 
i look at the kids
i see at school every day 
i see the ones who are ostracized 
they re   
different  they re out of step 
and i see the lives they ll have
because of that 
sometimes i see them years later 
in town  at the supermarket 
 stammering  i see 
i can tell that they still carry
that stuff around with them 
like a   
black aura 
like a millstone 
like an oozing wound 
jake 
  i m thinking   
  here  ta da 
 young woman  oh  man  that s brutal 
brutal place  the land of tulsey town 
climate change here too 
have you read the novel ice 
   young woman  i don t think so 
   jake  by anna kavan 
i don t think so 
 jake  1967  it s a fable of sorts 
about   
let s just get the ice cream and go 
it s freezing 
wait a minute 
i just want to see who s on tonight first 
 young woman  you know the people
who work here 
some of them 
well  i stop sometimes
after visiting my parents 
i don t like some of the girls
that work here  so i just wanna make sure 
   young woman  what s wrong with them 
  i don t know  people   
can be cold to me 
  uh  i m gonna wait in the car 
   jake  no  no  say hello 
they won t come if they know it s me 
 knocking 
  hello  anybody here 
   woman  in a minute 
  so  ice takes place   
   young woman sighs 
during  uh   
an environmental cataclysm 
causing the world to become
  a frozen wasteland 
   knocking 
and the main   
 young woman groans 
 woman  hi 
hi 
can i help you  sir 
uh   
so  yeah  uh  i ll have  uh   
oreo brr 
and he ll have   
 stammering 
same 
uh  two of those  please 
two  sames  
 giggles 
 women giggling 
uh  sorry  uh  we need to get back
on the road 
so can we get them as quick
as    as    as possible 
 women giggling 
uh  sorry  hi 
sorry about the smell  they re doing some
varnishing in the back 
varnishing 
shelves 
 young woman  oh  no problem 
 young woman  i know this girl 
i ve seen her somewhere 
i ve seen her before  her    her face 
her rash  i know her 
it s on the tip of my tongue 
tip of my brain  as jake says 
she s someone  she s from somewhere 
i m certain of it 
 shivering 
it s a fucking blizzard out there 
surprised you were open
on a night like this 
it s a fucking blizzard out there 
fucking brrr in here 
yeah  i i   
i was thinking the exact same thing 
you re kind 
   women giggle 
  you re not like them 
vapid and mean and pretty 
thanks a lot 
i didn t mean it like that 
i love the way you look 
you    you have a kindness 
and of course you re very attractive 
  i didn t mean it like that 
  it s ok  i understand 
it s  uh   
it s just  there seem   
seems to be a   
certain hardness that comes
with a certain kind of pretty 
you don t have that 
maybe they suffer too  the pretty ones 
i don t know  maybe   
maybe their prettiness
causes them suffering 
i m not a psychiatrist 
 young woman  what an odd thing to say 
of course she s not a psychiatrist 
she can t be more than 15 
made them extra high 
since you re so nice 
thanks 
it ll be eight dollars  please 
jake 
 jake breathes deeply 
keep the change 
  thank you 
  you re welcome  thanks 
i m worried 
excuse me 
i shouldn t be saying this 
you ok  do you need me to call for help 
it s not varnish 
that s not why it smells 
you should know that 
what do you mean 
  you don t have to go 
  i don t have to go where 
forward  in time  you   
you can stay here 
i m very scared 
about what  what are you scared about 
   woman  i m scared for you 
  thank you 
 women giggling 
have a good night  be careful 
the roads are treacherous 
 women giggling 
   car door opens 
   young woman sighs 
 women giggling 
   car door opens 
   engine turns over 
 car door closes 
 car door closes 
you notice that girl s arms 
  which girl 
  in the tulsey town 
 jake  which girl  there were    several 
several  there were three 
several is anything more than two 
really 
mm hmm  look it up 
 young woman  look it up 
can you stop saying that 
anyway  the one    the one with the rash
all over her arms 
i didn t notice 
you re being willfully obtuse 
not my intention 
 mockingly   not my intention  
anyway 
 jake  how s the brrr 
  too sweet 
  yeah  it s sweet 
i always forget how sweet these are 
a little goes a long way 
i don t think i can eat anymore of mine 
you barely touched it 
  it s very sweet 
   clears throat 
yeah 
it is a lot 
 inhales sharply 
  cold 
  yeah  the ice cream  i guess 
we re in the middle of a snow storm 
 inhales deeply 
whose idea was it to go to tulsey town
in the middle of all this  anyway 
i am not saying a word 
 jake laughs 
 young woman laughs 
 young woman  how odd 
this is probably the last time
i ll ever be in a car with jake 
soon this ll all be a distant memory 
we ll both be in different places 
remembering this moment 
this shared laugh 
and maybe there ll be regret 
 young woman laughing 
 young woman inhales deeply 
maybe time will soften
the harder edges  and   
we ll both think that was sort of nice 
why did it have to end 
and there s no way back at that point 
there s never a way back 
  you got quiet all of a sudden 
   young woman  just watching the storm 
if you can t even tell the other person
what you re thinking 
  that doesn t bode well 
   jake  looks like you re done with it 
what do you mean 
  bit of a wasted stop 
   young woman sniffs 
at least i can say i ve been
to tulsey town in the middle of the night 
in the middle of nowhere 
in the middle of a snowstorm 
  i m your favorite clown
from tulsey town  
  where ice cream grows on trees  
  so have no fear  come and join me here  
  eat as much as you please  
  i will turn your frown
fully upside down  
  when you take your very first bite  
  of vanilla  chocolate  or strawberry  
  and we re open day and night  
that s something i ll never do again 
 jake  a supposedly fun thing
you ll never do again 
  yes 
   jake  have you    have you read that 
read what 
it s a book of essays
by david foster wallace 
 inhales deeply 
nope  i have not 
 exhales 
it s a book    a book of essays 
ah  no  i haven t read it 
we should    we should find some place
to dump these 
they re going to melt
and get the cup holders all sticky 
 young woman  hmm 
ok 
hmm 
 jake  he s got this essay in it
about television 
 jake clears throat 
pretty people tend to appeal   
pretty people tend to be
more pleasing to look at
than non pretty people 
but when we re talking about television 
the combination of sheer audience size
and quiet psychic intercourse
between images and oglers
starts a cycle that both enhances
pretty images  appeal
and erodes us viewers 
own sense of security
in the face of gazes 
that    that s from the essay 
that s   
that s interesting 
he killed himself 
yeah  yeah  i i think i knew that 
 jake  yeah  everybody knows it 
even people who know nothing else
about david foster wallace 
never read a word of his writing 
suicide becomes the story 
the mythology 
the cautionary tale  it s obnoxious 
it s obnoxious 
i don t think we know how
to be human anymore 
who doesn t 
 jake  our society  our culture  people 
whatever all this is 
any of us 
 young woman  well  have you ever read
any guy debord 
  the society of the spectacle 
  exactly  yes 
yes  of course 
debord says   
 the spectacle cannot be understood
as a mere visual deception
produced by mass media technologies 
it is a worldview
that has actually been materialized  
watch the world through this glass 
pre interpreted for us 
and it infects our brains  we become it 
 whispers  like a virus 
listen  these    these melting things
are    are driving me crazy 
they re going to get
everything all sticky 
well  have you got a plastic bag
or something 
  no  no  nothing like that 
  a napkin maybe 
i want to find a place to dump them 
well  there doesn t seem
to be anything around here 
there s a small road
up ahead of us that i know of 
  there ll    there ll be a garbage can 
   sighs  i don t know 
may    maybe we should just head home 
to the farm 
no  to the city 
i m worried
we re gonna get stuck out here 
if we turn off the main road
and get stuck  no one s gonna find us 
it s not     stammering 
i m not going to feel right if i don t
get rid of these  it ll prey on my mind 
ok  shit 
shit 
   banging 
  hey  hey  it s not    it s    it s not   
it s   
it s not a big deal 
really 
i know that  ames 
   young woman  ames 
  i know that 
 young woman  is that short for amy 
that doesn t sound right 
that doesn t seem like my name 
or my nickname 
 jake  let s go here  real quick 
and i ll get to show you my high school 
this   
this goes to a high school 
 jake  my high school 
where i spent every tortured day   sighs 
for so long 
for so goddamn    long 
can we just turn around 
this doesn t feel right 
 jake  i don t understand 
it s just a    a high school 
   young woman  it feels wrong 
  i can t turn around 
the road is too narrow 
i ll just get to the school 
we ll dump the cups  and we ll leave 
 ok no  i i i don t   
i don t know what this is 
it doesn t make any sense to me 
how do school buses get down here 
it s a rural high school 
yeah  i went    i grew up on a farm 
i went to a rural high school 
we    there was a    there was a   
 stammering     a normal entrance
with a paved fucking road 
it s fine  everything is tinged 
ok  that s the thing
you have to realize 
  it s tinged 
  colored by mood  by emotion 
by past experience 
there is no objective reality 
you know there s no color
in the universe  right 
only in the brain 
just electromagnetic frequencies 
the brain tinges them 
yes  i am a physicist 
i know what color is 
yes  yes  yes  you are 
you do 
color is the deeds of light 
it s the deeds and suffering 
that s beautiful 
it s not physicist talk 
but eminently poetic 
yeah  well  i am a poet after all 
 jake  you are  it s beautiful 
  this road seems excessively long 
  seems 
that s the operative word 
time is another thing
that exists only in the brain 
  and yet we get older 
  older and older  older and older 
or so it seems 
sometimes i feel   
i m much younger
than i actually am 
like still a kid inside 
until i pass a mirror 
  is younger better 
  yes   exhales 
  i think so  it s admirable 
   scoffs 
 young woman  youth is admirable 
how can you admire a person for their age 
it s like admiring a certain point
in a stream 
it s healthier 
it s brighter 
it s more fun 
more attractive  hopeful 
 young woman 
like a coca cola commercial 
almost all groundbreaking work
in science and the arts
is done by young people 
old people are the ash heap of youth 
listen  jake 
i i m thinking that we need to   
ta da 
 young woman  wow 
i didn t expect anything so enormous 
 jake  one hundred and thirty classrooms 
a gymnasium  two locker rooms 
boys  girls 
auditorium  ten bathrooms 
six administrative offices 
teachers  lounge 
counselor s center 
   wind whistling 
  it s regional  so 11 towns feed into it 
well  you certainly know your high school 
like the back of my hand 
 wind whistling 
  there s someone here 
  school maintenance 
janitor  something 
ah 
what 
there 
  trash can  i knew it  be right back 
   car door opens 
 wind howling 
 windscreen wiper squeaks 
 young woman sighs 
 sighs 
 young woman sighs 
 wind howling 
come on 
good  yes  yes 
where were you 
that bin was filled with road salt
for the   
ice 
i remembered there s a   
a dumpster on the other side
near the loading docks 
  mission accomplished 
  let s go 
it s humid in here 
 jake sighs 
kind of peaceful 
more creepy than peaceful  i d say 
  i don t agree 
  i want to go 
  what s the rush all of a sudden 
  all of the sudden 
i ve been like a broken record all night 
telling you that i wanted to go home 
i ve given you like 40 reasons
why i need to get back tonight 
 jake grunts 
  i guess that s true 
  you guess 
 inhales deeply 
i just thought     exhales 
you know 
it s peaceful and quiet here 
baby  it s cold outside 
really 
you re gonna quote a rape song at me 
 scoffs 
it s not a   
it s not a rape song 
she keeps saying she wants to leave 
he keeps ignoring her 
what would you call that 
she wants to stay  she s just afraid
of what people will think 
she asks him   what have you put
in my damn drink  
jesus  the song was written in 1936 
 chuckling  it s not about roofies 
roofies or not  he s trying to break down
her defenses with strong liquor 
and anyway  they had mickeys in the  30s 
it s a song about coercion 
i don t know why you re getting so angry 
i just want to go home 
  to the farmhouse 
  not to the fucking farmhouse 
to my house 
jake  my house 
  ok 
   keys jangle 
   engine turns over 
   young woman  thank you 
and then    and then he says 
 what s the point in hurting my pride  
like it s her job to make this guy
feel sexually attractive 
regardless of her own desires 
like that s   
like that s her responsibility 
i see that 
you have convinced me  i m sorry 
i m sorry 
 wind howling 
it s all right 
 smooching 
 young woman chuckles slightly 
   voice loudly echoing 
  jesus 
what  what 
there was someone watching us 
  i didn t see anyone 
   jake  well  he was watching us 
like    like a goddamn pervert 
  let s go 
   jake  believe me  i m very familiar
with that particular look 
jake  i just   
what the hell does that mean 
i m going to give him a piece of my mind 
  jake  don t be ridiculous 
  it s not acceptable 
   young woman  jake  let s just go 
  no 
   young woman  you don t   
   stammers  i ll be right back  this   
  it   
   honks horn 
  it s unacceptable 
  let s go  jake  let s just go 
   jake  i ll be right back 
  don t  jake  don t  please 
 car door closes 
 yells  jake 
 banging 
crap 
 young woman sighs 
oh  i shouldn t have come 
i shouldn t have come 
 yells  aah  fuck 
 wind howling 
it s hard to say no 
i was never taught that 
it s easier just to say yes 
anyway  sometimes
you re just caught off guard 
and the request comes 
can i have your number 
and the easiest way out of it
is just to say yes 
and then that yes turns into more yes 
and then it s yes  yes  yes 
 wind whistling 
 laughing 
 wind whistling 
he s not a monster  he   
 car door opens 
jake 
 car door closes 
 sighs 
he doesn t beat you 
right 
i m certain the sex has been good 
at least some of the time 
just   
 sighs 
how long does it take to get hypothermia 
eh   
maybe it s not a bad way to go
if i have to go 
 wind howling 
 slight grunt 
 shivering 
jake 
jake 
 yells  jake 
 yelling  shit  shit  shit 
oh  my god 
piece of shit  shit 
shit  shit 
 panting 
oh  god 
 shivering 
 shivering and breathing heavily 
 shivering 
 serene instrumental music playing 
 keys jangling 
 cart clattering 
jake 
jake  i wanna go  please 
 tense music plays 
 keys jangling 
 grunting 
 humming 
 janitor  ah 
 continues humming 
 janitor mutters indistinctly 
oh   
hello 
 breathing heavily 
hello 
i m sorry  m my   
my boyfriend came in here 
i think he went to school here
a while back 
 shaky inhale 
maybe you know him  i   i    i don t   
i don t    i don t know
if you were here when   
when he was a student 
i mean  how would i know  anyway  i   
you haven t seen anyone around here 
have you 
 janitor  what does your boyfriend
look like 
it s hard to describe people 
it was so long ago  i barely remember 
i mean   
we never even talked 
is the truth  i m not even sure
i registered him  there s a lot of people 
i was there with my girlfriend   
we were celebrating our anniversary 
stopped in for a drink 
and then this guy
kept looking at me 
it s a nuisance 
the occupational hazard of   
of being a female 
you can t even go for a drink 
always being looked at 
he was a creeper  you know 
 stammers  and i remember thinking 
i wish my boyfriend was here 
which is   
that s sort of sad 
that being a woman 
the only way a guy leaves you alone
is if you re with another guy 
like  if    like   
like you ve been claimed 
like you re property  even then 
anyway  i can t   
i can t remember what he looks like 
why would i 
nothing happened 
maybe it was just   
 sniffs 
i think it was just   
just one of thousands
of such non interactions in my life 
 laughing 
it s like asking me to describe
a mosquito that bit me
on an evening 40 years ago 
 sighs 
well  you haven t seen anyone

i haven t seen anyone 
 young woman  ok

i m sure there s no need 
he s safe if he s here 
it s safe in here 
it s quiet 
 young woman humming softly 
 inhales deeply 
is it ok if i look around for him 
maybe take your wet shoes off 
i ve just cleaned the floors 
no

 chuckles 
 footsteps departing

 pig  it s not bad once you stop
feeling sorry for yourself
because you re just a pig 
or  even worse 
a pig infested with maggots 
someone has to be
a pig infested with maggots  right 
it might as well be you 
it s the luck of the draw 
you play the hand you re dealt 
you make lemonade  you    you move on 
you don t worry about a thing 
  that song has always made me cry 
   pig  i ve always loved it 
there is kindness in the world  you know 
you have to search for it  but it s there 
  you re kind 
   pig  eh  i m just evolving 
even now  even as a ghost  as a memory 
as dust  as you will 
we re the same 
everything is the same
when you look close enough 
as a physicist  you know that 
you  me  ideas  we re all one thing 
let s get you dressed

that it entails 
that this award comes   
near the end of a long  fruitful life 
in acknowledgment for the work i did

through the physical  the metaphysical 
the delusional   
 inhales sharply 
and back 
and i have made the most important   
discovery of my career   
 sharp inhale 
the most important discovery
of my life 
it is only in the mysterious equations
of love

thank you 
 applause 
 prop clattering 
  the floor creaks  
  the door squeaks  
  there s a field mouse
a nibblin  on a broom  
  and i sit by myself  
  like a cobweb on a shelf  
  by myself  
  in a lonely room  
  but when there s a moon in my winder  
  and it slants down a beam
 cross my bed  
  then the shadder of a tree  
  starts a dancin  on the wall  
  and a dream starts a dancin 
in my head  
  and all the things that i wish fer  
  turn out like i want them to be  
  and i m better
than that smart aleck cowhand  
  who thinks he s better than me  
  and the girl that i want
ain t afraid of my arms  
  and her own soft arms keep me warm  
  and her long  tangled hair  
  falls across my face  
  just like the rain  
  in a storm   
 wind whistling 
  the floor creaks  
  the door squeaks  
  and a mouse starts a nibbling
on the broom  
  and the sun flicks my eyes  
  it was all a pack o  lies   
  i m awake  
  in a lonely room  
  i ain t gonna dream of her arms
no more  
  i ain t gonna leave her alone  
  goin  outside  
  git myself a bride  
  git me a woman to call  
  my own  
 audience applause 
 sobs happily
