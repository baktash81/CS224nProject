considered one victimheroine womens liberation
women liberationists
willing accept textbook spinoffs art
junoesque gena rowlands
mrs cassavetes prodigious actress never lets go character

beauty deepened beyond ingenue roles
rowlands look old young
shades expression transform mabel longhetti
stammers radiantly flirtatious beauty
sad sagging neighborhood drunk
rowlands externalizes schizophrenic dissolution
mabel fragments eyes

mabel tries slash wrist
nick puts bandaid cut
idiot symbolism enough make want hoot
twohour minute movie
leaves groggy moan

characters surrounding mabel
stammers show isolation become instead limp false moments
unclear whether characters unconscious
whether cassavetes whos unconscious hes
children keep murmuring love
theres clue decipher refrain
coddling
reversing roles treating like child need reassurance
unashamedly loving
