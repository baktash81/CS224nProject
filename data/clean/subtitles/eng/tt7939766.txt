young woman
im thinking of ending things
once this thought arrives it stays
it sticks it lingers it dominates
theres not much i can do about it
trust me
it doesnt go away
its there whether i like it or not
its there when i eat when i go to bed
its there when i sleep when i wake up
its always there always
i havent been thinking about it for long
the idea is new
but it feels old at the same time
when did it start
what if this thought
wasnt conceived by me
but planted in my mind predeveloped
inhales
is an unspoken idea unoriginal
maybe ive actually known all along
maybe this is how
it was always going to end
jake once said
sometimes the thought
is closer to the truth
to reality than an action
you can say anything you can do anything
but you cant fake a thought
the road is mostly empty
its quiet around here vacant
more so than anticipated
so much to see but not many people
not many buildings or houses
sky
trees fields fences
the road and its gravel shoulders
you wanna stop for a coffee
i think im ok i say
last chance well have
before it becomes really farmy
im visiting jakes parents
for the first time
or i will be when we arrive
jake my boyfriend
he hasnt been my boyfriend for very long
its our first trip together
inhales our first long drive
so its weird that im feeling nostalgic
about our relationship
about him about us
inhales deeply
i should be excited
looking forward to the first of many
but im not not at all
ive seen more barns on this drive
than ive seen in years
maybe in my life
they all look the same
some cows some horses sheep fields
and barns
such a big sky
feels like ive known jake
longer than i have
what has it been
oh a month
six weeks maybe seven
inhales i should know exactly
ill say seven weeks
mans voice speaking indistinctly
man the assumptions are right
i can feel my fear growing now is the
young woman we have a real connection
a rare and intense attachment
ive never experienced anything like it
man growing now is the time
for the answer just one question
one question to answer
its snowing
winter is comin in
yep
young woman laughing
look at the sky
bird cawing
young woman
im thinking of ending things
huh
what
did you say something
chuckling no i dont think so
weird
yeah
jake inhales deeply
young woman
im thinking of ending things
whats the point in carrying on like this
i know what it is where its going
jake is a nice guy but
its not going anywhere
ive known this for a while now
maybe its human nature to keep going
in the face of this knowledge
the alternative requires too much energy
decisiveness
hmm
people stay in unhealthy relationships
because its easier
basic physics
an object in motion
tends to stay in motion
people tend to stay in relationships
past their expiration date
its newtons first law of emotion
do you want to stop for a coffee
or something a a snack
its its going to get pretty farmy
pretty fast now
no no no im im fine
you sure
young woman mmhmm
dont want to spoil my appetite
slight chuckle
chuckles
ok
theme music playing
audio from mr peabody and sherman
on television
slurping
faucet running
swing squeaking
you know my mother hasnt been
feeling well recently
oh
jake so
im sorry
im just saying
that there might not be much of a spread
that she might not be up to
a lot of cooking
um
she hasnt been well
whats going on with her
just saying if you want
to stop for a snack
or anything like that
it would probably be fine
um
in terms of appetite spoiling
it might even be advisable
slight chuckle
im fine
ok
turns on radio
man on radio come join me my friends
and accept jesus into your hearts
for as isaiah 118 tells us
though your sins be as scarlet
they shall be as white as snow
they really are looking forward
to meeting you
i dont want to give you
the wrong impression
aww thats nice to hear
jake a lot about you
yeah iiim im
im really looking forward
to meeting them too
young woman maybe its unfair of me
to be going on this trip with jake
when im so uncertain about our future
our lack of it
after all going to meet
your boyfriends parents
is the proverbial next step isnt it
the truth is i havent even
told my parents im dating jake
ive never mentioned him
and i dont think i ever will
she hasnt been feeling well
getting old aint for sissies
as bette davis said
jake true although
one might just take issue
with her use of the word sissy
yeah of course yeah yes sir
jake as a pejorative
it was a different time
young woman i guess its curiosity
jake is certainly hard to figure
maybe its like a window into his origins
the child being father of the man and all
are you a fan of wordsworth then
wordsworth
jake william wordsworth the poet
um
not im not familiar really
why do you ask
just thinking about him for some reason
chuckles
he popped into my head
exhales
his poem ode intimations of immortality
from recollections of early childhood
jesus thats the title
jake chuckles
chuckles sounds like an entire poem
well
young woman im thinking of
get your words worth with wordsworth
imitates gunshot fired
do you want to hear how it starts
its just that the
im not a metaphoricaltype gal
its just that that one speaks to me
uh incidentally wordsworth wrote
a series of poems to a woman named lucy
like me
a beautiful idealized woman
who dies young
oh yikes
well the comparison goes
only as far as your name
phew
jake and that you are ideal
of course
yeah yeah inhales sharply
ah thats very sweet
cell phone rings
young woman its just
continues ringing
whos that
uh its just a friend
im not gonna answer
you can i dont mind you should
eh its ok
its all right
i dont mind
young woman chuckles
sighs
thats odd did you see that swing set
we just passed
what swing set
it was weird
it was this beautiful new swing set
in front of an abandoned house
no i missed it
what
i didnt see it
why would that be there
i mean clearly no ones lived
in that house for years
someones moving in and
they brought the swing set first
thats all i can think of
i
young woman that seems
like an unlikely sequence of events
exhales you know like
to have something
to entertain the kids while the parents
are getting the house ready
exhales
odd
theyre saying uh
there might be a fair amount of snow
yeah
theyre predicting it
do you think we should maybe turn back
ive got a fair amount of
well a lot actually
of work to do tomorrow
i need to get home tonight so that i
i think well be ok
ive got tire chains in the trunk
what are you working on
oh i have a paper due wednesday
which one is this
susceptibility to rabies infection
in the sensory dorsal
root ganglia neurons
the trigeminal ganglia as well right
yes exactly
both chuckle
point for me
interested in and knowledgeable
about my girlfriends work
point for jake
hows the paper going
oh
sighs its nowhere actually
i really do need to get back tonight
deal with it first thing
ill get you home
chains
chains
young woman yeah i do like jake
and hes educated
our fields are different
but hes curious and keeps up
thats a good thing
its in the pro column
and hes cute in his awkward way
were interesting together too
giggles
young woman
people look at us when were together
whos that couple
i dont get looked at alone
and jake doesnt either
jake tells me that he feels it
feels invisible
you want to listen to something
deep breath
sorry uh what
um
i asked if you want to listen
to some music
oh yeah sure
turns on radio
tuning radio
when you get out this far
theres not much signal
many a new day plays
laughing
its an odd song
laughs to
out here in in the middle of nothing
its from oklahoma
the musical
i didnt know you were a fan
of musical theater
well im not really
anyway i just know a few musicalsuh
oklahoma phantom
carousel south pacific
guys and dolls flower drum song
laughs
wicked
how to succeed in business
without really trying music man
pajama game cabaret
the lion king grease
the king and i the sound of music
pal joey charleys aunt on the town
my fair lady
but i know oklahoma best i guess
they do it every few years
inhales deeply
for obvious reasons
wait who does it every few years
sometimes i see kids
who were in past productions you know
um at the supermarket
working at stores in town
inhales deeply
exhales older now
girl sings
fly a kiss gone by is bygone
never have i asked an august sky
where has last july gone
many a new face will please my eye
many a new love will find me
never have i once looked back to sigh
over the romance behind
this girl seems healthy enough
in her attitude
good for her
she shes protesting too much
it turns out
weve all been there
exhales
where
protesting too much
how ok everything is
inhales thats why i like road trips
its good to remind yourself
the worlds larger
than the inside of your own head
you know
mmhmm
both perspective
jake perspective
young woman it is beautiful out here
in a bleak heartbroken kind of way
what was the last road trip i took
hmm
i should remember but i dont
nothings coming to mind
its odd im foggy
about so many things lately
do you like this type of landscape
mmm
yeah its beautiful
its melancholy
i do like that
jake inhales deeply
its the poet in you
young woman chuckles
yeah
i suppose so
maybe i dont know
you been working on anything
uh ii clears throat
i just finished something
yeah i dont i dont know
jake can i hear it
you can read it
i like to hear them in your voice
and youre so good at reciting them
not really but thanks
itll go with the poetic scenery
exhales i dont know jake
i just dont
i dont really feel much like performing
right now
come on itll pass the time
inhales sharply
i dont want you to get bored
its called bonedog
wind whistling
coming home is terrible
whether the dogs lick your face or not
whether you have
inhales deeply
a wife
or just a wifeshaped loneliness
waiting for you
coming home is terribly lonely
so that you think
of the oppressive barometric pressure
back where you have just come from
with fondness
because everythings worse
once youre home
you think of the vermin
clinging to the grass stalks
inhales
long hours on the road
roadside assistance and ice creams
and the peculiar shapes of certain clouds
and silences
with longing
because you did not want to return
coming home is
just awful
and the homestyle silences and clouds
contribute to nothing
but the general malaise
clouds such as they are
are in fact suspect
and made from a different material
than those you left behind
you yourself were cut
from a different cloudy cloth
returned
remaindered
illmet by moonlight
unhappy to be back
slack in all the wrong spots
seamy suit of clothes
dishragratty worn
wind whistling
you return home
moonlanded
foreign
the earths gravitational pull
an effort now redoubled
inhales deeply
dragging your shoelaces loose
exhales
and your shoulders
etching deeper the stanza of worry
on your forehead
you return home deepened
a parched well linked to tomorrow
by a frail strand of
anyway
you sigh into the onslaught
of identical days
one might as well at a time
well
anyway
youre back
the sun goes up and down
like a tired whore
the weather immobile like a broken limb
while you just keep getting older
nothing moves but the shifting tides
of salt in your body
your vision blears
you carry your weather with you
the big blue whale
a skeletal darkness
you come back
with xray vision
your eyes have become a hunger
you come home with your mutant gifts
to a house of bone
everything you see now
all of it
bone
wow
young woman
well wow is an allpurpose exclamation
i just realized that chuckles
it might be it can
it can mean you you loved it
or it can mean there are no words
to describe how
sniffs how rubbish it is
i love it
i love it its amazing
its its like
its like you wrote it about me
oh you know iii
i guess thats what one hopes for
when writing a poem sniffs
jake whats that
some universality in the specific
i dont know
its like you wrote it about me
sighs
young woman
im thinking of ending things
jake is really great
hes really sweet
hes sensitive
and he listens to me and hes smart
but theres just something sighs
ineffable
profoundly unutterably
unfixably wrong here
are you ok
yeah
you just seem sort of far away is all
im just thinking
sniffs
about what
inhales deeply
uh
i dont know just exhales
vague in my head stuff
vague in your head stuff
i guess i was thinking about time
really
yeah
like were on a train
and it takes us where it takes us
theres no veering off
theres no side trips
and like mussolinis train
it runs on time
but thats not really true
about mussolini and trains
the improvements
in the railway system preceded him
he just took the credit
and even still
they didnt always run on time
i wasnt really talking
about mussolinis train
and anyway you
you can always jump off a train
young woman in movies
in real life youll probably die
jumping from a moving train chuckles
thats thats very true
i suppose i watch too many movies
hmm everybody does
societal malady
jake fill my brain with lies
to pass the time
in the blink of an eye
and an eye blink
in excruciatingly slow motion
young woman its like the rabies virus
attaching itself to our ganglia
changing us into itself
viruses are monstrous
everything wants to live jake
inhales
viruses are just one more example
of everything
but
even fake crappy movie ideas
want to live
like they grow in your brain
replacing real ideas
thats what makes them dangerous
but did you know
there are insects that blow themselves up
yes
not everything wants to live
there are certain ants certain aphids
for the good of their community
there are suicide bombers
scoffs
pig come
join me
so not everything wants to live
right
true well they
they want their communities to live
which is sort of like themselves
writ large
anyway we dont really know
if they want anything
its just most likely
how theyre programmed
maybe were all programmed right
sighs
imitates explosion sound
and now were both dead
jake tada
wind whistling
wind howling
so uh im not im not ready to go in
ii need to stretch my legs long legs
long drive
what what isnt that rude
she clearly knows were here
weve been waving at each other for
quite a long time
they know i like to stretch my legs
come on ill show you around
jake i dont know
its its its its cold
and its getting dark
come on
come on ill give you the abridged tour
young woman groans
jake maybe well
come back in the spring
and we can lie out here
and look up at the universe
window creaking open
the sheep
lamb bleats
sheep bleats
lets say hi
sheep bleating
hi sheep
hi sheep
young woman there is something
dreary and sad in here
and it smells
i wonder what it must be like
to be a sheep
spend ones entire life in this miserable
smelly place doing nothing
eating shitting sleeping
sheep bleats
over and over
jake well there you have it
sheep bleats
the sheep
lamb bleats
young woman what happened to the lambs
jake what
sheep bleats
what will happen
i dont know what youre asking me
theyre already dead so wh
what else can happen to them
well i mean will they be buried
probably be burned
come spring
sheep bleats
but theyre frozen solid for now
so theyre fine
wind howling
no worries
come on ill show you the the old pen
where we used to keep the pigs
sheep bleats
they had to put them down
thats too bad
jake rotten situation the pigs
life isnt always pretty on a farm
something you should know
lamb bleating
so what what happened to them
to the pigs
lamb bleats
lamb bleats
forget it uh i dont think
youd like the story
cant do that you have to tell me now
yeah
yes jesus
jake ok well
um
lamb bleats
my dad hadnt been in
to check on the pigs for a few days
my parents were busy
hed just tossed their food into the pen
but after a few days
he noticed that they were all just lying
in this corner all the time
so he went in to check on them
they didnt look well
he decided hed better try to move them
and theyre heavy
theyre pigs right
but yeah he he finally managed
to move one and discovered
its entire underside
was filled with maggots
both pigs were being eaten alive
wind howling
deep breath
life can be brutal on a farm
should we go inside its getting cold
young woman everything has to die
thats the truth
one likes to think
that there is always hope
that you can live above death
and its a uniquely human fantasy
that things will get better
born perhaps of the uniquely
human understanding that things will not
theres no way to know for certain
but i suspect humans are the only animals
that know the inevitability
of their own deaths
cart creaking
other animals live in the present
humans cannot
so they invented hope
hello
hello
im here
were here
hello
hello
its jake
hello
hello
dad well be right down
jake ok
so
do you want slippers
i
floors are cold here
old houses will you hold this please
yeah
yeah thanks i think
jake um
theyll be big on you
theyre my old ones but they are warm
ah voilà
giggling
none for you
no
no no no no no no no no
you should have these
these are yours
oh no
what kind of gentleman
would that make me
my slippers are your slippers
you sure
i am
jake speaking spanish
young woman laughs
jake um have a seat
floorboards creaking
theyll be right down
music
sure
instrumental music playing
instrumental music continues
shoe squeals
coughs
instrumental music continues
so the the bedrooms are upstairs
not much else um
inhales deeply
my moms sewing room
bedroom linen closet
um
i can show you after we eat
if youd like
chuckles
its not fancy
as you can see
its nice i like it
yeah
young woman yes
reminds me of the house i grew up in
jake inhales deeply
i suppose all farmhouses are alike
like all happy families
im not sure tolstoy got that one right
happiness in a family
is as nuanced as unhappiness
well i think he was
talking about marriage
ah here they come
ill just get a fire going
in the meantime
jake lights match
whispers your parents knew
we were coming right
i mean they invited us and all
invitation sounds a little formal
for my family
but yeah of course
we communicated
young woman ok cool
fire crackling
young woman hmm
this fire feels good
cozy
whats in there
the basement
young woman oh
i see
we keep it closed off mostly
cause old houses tend to be
drafty
right inhales
anyway
the basement is unfinished
a hole in the ground really
a hole in the ground
just water heater washer and dryer
stuff like that
we dont use it really for anything else
ok
so its a waste of space
i hate the basement if you
really want to know
you have intense feelings about it
stammers you
you know when youre a kid
uh basements are scary
well we didnt have one
growing up in an apartment
but watching those scary movies
you get the idea
chuckles
low voice
dont look down in the basement
laughs
oh whoa
both laughing
exactly laughs
young woman laughs
hes hiding in there shh
who
what
um
what are those scratches on the door
jake inhales
dog from the dog mostly
i
i love dogs
jake chuckles
i didnt know your parents have a dog
i usually can tell when theres a dog
in someones house
toys lying around and
my folks are tidy
well where is it what
what kind whats its name
so many questions uh jimmy
hes a border collie
probably outside or
gasps
oh hi jimmy
hi
jimmy panting
oh hes all wet chuckles
softly growling and whimpering
thats
ah here they come
laughing oh
oh
smooches
aww
was the drive ok
yeah fine
mother oh
so glad to meet you louisa
young woman oh
mother jake has told us
so much about you
young woman oh hes told me so much
about both of you too chuckles
oh and you came anyway
laughing
hi
well lets eat all the food
will be as cold as a witchs tit
in a brass brassiere
laughing
oh it smells great
mother i hope youre hungry
all homemade everything you see
on the table is from the farm
inhales
looks lovely
so exhales
jake tells us youre a painter
yes jake tells you correctly
i dont really know much about art
but i like pictures where you know
what youre looking at
whats it called uh abstract
i dont get that
i could do abstract smear some paint on
whats it called
canvas i think its a con job
if you ask me
i like paintings
that look like photographs
i couldnt do that in a million years
that is talent
why why not just take a photograph
dad if you like photographs
its much quicker and photographs look
exactly like photographs
i like photographs
mostly sports photographs
mother what kind of paintings
do you make lucy
uh well iim not an abstract artist
so thats in my favor
good you see thats exactly my point
you see good
ii do mostly landscape
like outside paintings
uh yes mmhmm plein air
which is outdoor painting chuckles
i try to capture the feel
of light and atmosphere
that sounds lovely
jake used to paint too of course
mom
he worked really hard at it
aww
i didnt know that
he was very good
jake mom
aww
i try to imbue my work with a sort of
interiority
interiority so you paint
inside
young woman well inside my head
so a landscape would attempt to express
how i feel at that time
lonely joyous worried ssad
that sounds very interesting
like that painting of that girl
sitting in a field looking at a house
christinas world wyeth
yes exactly
laughing
but without people
uh
how can a picture of a field be sad
without a sad person
looking sad in the field
thats an interesting problem
i
yeah iiii
i i struggle with that
laughs
uh
well i have some pictures of my work
if youd like to see them
wind whistling
oh yes
yeah
yes
mother yes
young woman yeah
uh
these here
father mmm
mmm
mmm
ah
mmm ah
mmm i mean theyre pretty
but i dont see how its supposed
to make me feel something
if theres not a person in them
feeling something
if theres not a person in them
feeling sad or joyous
or whatever other emotion you said
well mmaybe think of yourself
as the person looking out at the scene
id have to see me in them
well if you were there
you wouldnt see yourself right
well i would if i looked down
im not a ghost
yet
i can attest to that chuckles
especially in the bedroom
giggling
stammering i mean but if you were there
looking out at it without looking down
youd youd see the scene
and youd feel something
anything an environment makes you feel
is about you
not the environment right
none of
none of the feeling
is inherent to the place
father uh thats over my head i guess
they are pretty though
youre very talented chuckles
thank you
i like the colors
thanks
psst jake you didnt tell us
your girlfriend was so talented
i did actually
laughing
anyway uh clears throat
i mean sometimes i
i wouldve thought
mmm
because
wind whistling
uh so
clears throat jake
tells me youre studying quantum psychics
at the university
yes
physics
really
yeah
thats unusual for a girl isnt it
yes it is actually
im just asking
stammers a little less so these days
which i think is a good thing
mother well after seventh grade
i couldnt understand
what jake was saying
so its wonderful he has someone
he can share all his ideas with
jake tells us theres been lots of famous
husband and wife physicists
ooh laughs
dad
wind whistling
yeah chuckles
stammers i guess there have been some
uh pierre and marie curie
shared a nobel prize in physics
well even ive heard of them
well ive heard of her anyway radiation
uh radioactivity
radium
yes
i am so glad jake has found someone
giggling
wont you please tell us the story
of how you met
jake has refused
i love romantic meeting stories
like in forget paris
billy crystal
i didnt like that movie
billy crystal is a nancy
um
wind whistling
so laughs
uh
i went with a friend
to a bar near campus and
it turned out to be trivia night
oh i love this so far
jake is crazy about trivia
we used to play
the genius edition of the
we used to play the genius edition
genus
we used to play the genius edition
genus
mother of trivial pursuit what
its genus edition
oh i always thought the word was genius
ive been saying it wrong all these years
goes to show im no genus
both laughing
thats a good one
jake no no no
wind whistling
genus is not
the same as genius
a genus is a category
i always thought
it was the genius edition
i told everyone he knew every answer
in the genius edition
i was very proud of that laughs
why didnt we get the genius
yells there is no
jake breathing heavily
genius edition
ok
wind howling
inhales so jake was
with his trivia team
and my friend and i
found an empty table near him
and i was watching him
because you thought he was cute
young woman laughing yeah i did
and he was very serious about the game
which i found i dont know charming
and oh his team was called
brezhnevs eyebrows
brezhnevs eyebrows right
inhales
young woman i asked who brezhnev was
basically so i could say something to him
and he told me
that brezhnev was a soviet engineer
stammering and a general of the
uh the section head of
secretary of the communist party
during the age of starvation
stagnation
young woman stagnation
anyway those team names
drive me nuts usually
they all have the most teams showoffy
but i dont know it didnt
bother me so much with jake
i guess i didnt let it
because i thought he was cute
aw he is cute isnt he laughs
so iii was trying to get up the nerve
to talk to him because
even though he looked over at me
more than once
it was clear he wasnt gonna say anything
stammers i thought you said
you were talking about brezhnev
wind howling
uh
yes thats true
but we didnt talk anymore after that
i guess is what i meant
oh
so i said something stupid like
you guys seem to be doing well
laughs
giggles
and i had to practically yell it
it was so noisy
and jake jake raised his glass
and went well yeah
well were helpfully fortified
and i laughed which broke the ice
and i think he was egged on
by my laughing
cause he went on to tell me
that he was a cruc
verbalist
young woman verbalist
and i didnt know what that meant
but ii didnt want to admit that
so i just said
cool
cool
and he was showing off again
and poorly
and i thought this guy is awkward
he has no game at all
inhales and there was something
sort of appealing about that
wind whistling
but then he kept going
and he told me that he wanted
his team name to be ipseity
and i was like ugh
you didnt like him anymore
no
i did
mother chuckles
i just wanted that stuff to stop
so i told him
you know i dont know that word
why dont you just cut the crap
laughs
and he said something like
im an asshole
laughs
laughing hysterically
laughs
im not very good at talking to people
and ipseity is just another word
for selfhood
inhales anyway after that he talked
like a normal person and he was funny
and i could see he wanted to ask
for my number
but was shy
and i was getting up to go
my girlfriend wanted to leave
and jake
blurted out could he have my number
oh
young woman laughs
there you go jake
young woman laughs
its about time
and the rest was history
that was like
six weeks ago
god feels longer
exhales
feels like forever in a way
slight chuckle
i cant
i cant even remember how long ago it is
wind howling
inaudible

mans voice theres only one question

just one question
one question to answer
wind whistling
sighs

oh she was just calling to say hi
mother how nice
friends are important
jake never really had a lot of them
growing up or even after
remember your 50th birthday
twentieth
mother what did i say

jake fiftieth
oh laughs
goodness where is my brain
laughing
wind howling
door shaking
anyway
friends can be helpful
hmm thats what ive always found
cause life can be difficult
on a farm
doesnt get any easier
as it trudges along ill say that
what
father doesnt get any easier
loudly what doesnt
yells life
oh no it doesnt
its basically a fast train to hell
for gods sake mom
all right all right yes
im overstating it i agree
its a fast train to heck
mother and father laughing hysterically
mother continues laughing
trailing off as in pain
your mother was always very funny
mother breathes shakily
its what i loved about her
i think its the
the first thing that i fell in love with
kind of faded as she got older
wears you down i guess chuckles
its not so funny anymore
i miss her terribly
yeah
wind whispering
so lucia
is studying gerontology
oh really
oh how fascinating
oh fascinating
yes
ive always been interested
in the problems associated with aging
i think our society has an almost
repulsed relationship to the aged
which is eminently foolish
seeing that its an inevitable and natural
part of the life cycle
of all living things
not to mention its terribly unkind
oh
how interesting
and compassionate
oh weve gotta keep her jake
oh how kind she is
laughs
wind howling
boy its uh
its looking pretty bad out there
i dont know jake
ii think we should probably
wind howling
jake
jake
jake
jake what
young woman
iiii think we should go
its looking pretty bad
jake i have chains
rattling
softly growling and whimpering
where are you
jake upstairs
im coming up
just letting you know
wind howling
jake
wind howling intensifies
jake
where are you
jake
door creaks open
young woman coming home is terrible
whether the dogs lick your face or not
whether you have a wife or just
a wifeshaped loneliness waiting for you
coming home is terribly lonely
gasps
breathing heavily
sorry you
you scared me
oh im sorry
breathing heavily
this is
jakes childhood bedroom
yeah
yeah ii
i saw the sign on the door
oh that
how can i explain that
my memory is going um
early signs of uh
sighs
uh
alzheimers
dementia
lewy bodies
yeah i think thats it
weve taken to
labeling things
around the home
youll see labels all over the house
i havent noticed
you will notice
im sorry to hear that yyoure
thats ok
truth is
im looking forward
to when it gets very bad
and i dont have to remember
that i cant remember
laughs
mother cackling
father chuckles
seems that thatll be a
better way to um
oh come on chuckles
yeah
they say that every cloud has a
inhales deeply
sighs
a silver
silver ah thats it exactly silver
they say that every cloud has a silver
and uh
well i believe that to be true
oh

his mother and i arent old fashioned
about that kind of thing
fucking and whatnot
oh i i i have to get home tonight
i have work in in the morning
i know this bed
looks a bit small for two um
oh come on
uh uh grownups
its a childs bed after all
not even for twin children
just for one child im sure
for a single night you could make do
thats very generous of you but i
ii do have to
i imagine you wont be doing
any fucking in this bed
not really made for fucking
its a childs bed
just for one child not two
right
sure i can find
one of my wifes old um
oh
chuckles
things for you to wear for tonight
might have to dig through some trunks
sure i can find one of my wifes
old things for you to wear
for tonight oh look theres
jakes old room
chuckles
groans
gasps
fire crackling
mother groaning
young woman jake
weakly oh its the girlfriend
open up
jake the snow i need to leave
ive told him over and over
its time for him to leave
mom you need to eat
ill be down in a minute
mom
jakes always been a good boy
mom
mother diligent
groans
he won a pin
maybe not as naturally talented
as some of the other students
but
he worked so hard
and thats even more impressive
being a genus
genius mom
mother softly genius
the luck of the draw really
the genetic lottery as they say
but to do as well as jake did
with no special talent or abilities
oh breathing heavily
thats much more impressive
mm
young woman yes
maybe you should
yells soon
ok
we will leave soon
let me just finish up here
wind howling
grunting
grunting and groaning
wind howling intensifies
jake mom
young woman im impressed
with your attentiveness to your mom
its rare
we tend to warehouse our elderly
its really special
how devoted a son you are
im glad to hear you say that
that makes me feel better
sometimes it
feels like no one sees
the good things you do
wind howling
like youre just alone
whispers i see it
ill wait downstairs
give you some privacy
i dont want to live in a warehouse
young woman i should end this
just end it
i just make a clean break
no lingering
no waiting for things to get better
you can only wait so long
i dont even know who i am
in this whole thing anymore
where i stop and jake starts
im a pinball my emotional state
is bouncing all over the place
jake needs to see me
as someone who sees him
he needs to be seen
and he needs to be seen with approval
like thats my purpose
in all this in life
to approve of jake to keep him going
and he needs to see me as someone
whose approval of him is validated
because im approved of by others
look at my girlfriend
look at what i won
shes smart shes talented
shes sensitive
she can do this she knows about that
she made this she cares about that
let me just take him to the bathroom
then well go
young woman i need to end it
is that the girl
yes dad louisa
oh breathing heavily
good
i brought your mothers uh
nightgown
for her
thats stammers
very kind i
i have to go home tonight
soon
oh ii i dont understand
what does she mean
i dont know dad
i cant tell
young woman i have my shift tomorrow
shes a waitress
oh
jake chuckles
we we met when she was serving me
its a sweet story
i asked her about the
jake and young woman santa fe burger
all chuckling
im feeling confused
lets just get you to the bathroom
we dont want another accident
remember last night
mother whats this old thing doing here
im not sure
oh my goodness its filthy
its got jakes baby food on it
whats it doing here
chuckles i tell you
i would misplace my own head
if it wasnt screwed onto my own head
would you be a sweetheart and toss it
in the washer i just started a load
my hands are full picking up
all these darn toys
jake would leave his head on the floor
if it wasnt screwed onto his own head
young woman sure
where is it
in the basement
i dont think jake wants me down there
jake can be controlling
you cant allow him to control you
i think its the other side of his type
of personality this diligence thing
he needs to control everything
theres so many
many things that make him nervous
he keeps closing off more and more
of the world its a problem
and the few people
he does have left in his life
need to follow all sorts of rules
it really is a problem
yes im probably to blame
and all this guilt
causes me to feel obligated
sighs to bend over backwards
to accommodate his every little whim
its a vicious cycle
so what exactly are you saying to me
whispering im saying
take the darn nightgown to the basement
live dangerously
wind howling
inhales deeply then grunts
jake you you sent her down
mother to the washer
jake mom really
muffled you dont have to do laundry
for my mom
youre a guest
and we we well get you
a clean nightgown for tonight
i dont mind
jake well we really need
we really need to get on the road
i could i could use some help
with the chains
right ill be up
wind whistling
tense music plays
washer running
water splashing
water splashing
young woman its tragic how few people
possess their souls before they die
nothing is more rare in any man
says emerson
than an act of his own
and its quite true
most people are other people
their thoughts are
someone elses opinions
their lives a mimicry
their passions a quotation
thats an oscar wilde quote
cell phone ringing
mans voice theres only one question
to resolve
im scared i feel a little crazy
im not lucid
the assumptions are right
i can feel my fear growing
now is the time for the answer
just one question
one question to answer
closes door
breathing heavily
wind whistling
oh my god
jake is your mom
jake shushing
shes
shushing
shes asleep
young woman shes
we should go
its getting treacherous
are you certain shes all right
out like a light
its a good time to go
what about your dad
hes
inhales deeply
hes puttering somewhere
the disposals out again
it was great to meet you
it was great to meet you too
thank you so much for your hospitality
oh youre welcome here any time yes
jakes a good boy yes
young woman yes
yeah
a good man i should say
you agree
yes
ok then well
wind howling
sniffles
deep breath
wind howling
chains rattling
young woman groans
so
did you like them
uh yyes theyre very nice
wind whistling
really
yes
they can be a little pushy
but theyre basically decent people
that was eminently clear
they both loved you by the way
thats good im glad
jake so smart my mother said
slight chuckle did she
well not to you that wouldve
made you uncomfortable
but um when i was helping her
with the dishes
young woman i dont remember jake
helping his mother with the dishes
i feel uncertain about a lot
of what happened tonight it felt like
when you and dad were discussing
young woman what
when you and dad were discussing
young woman it seemed
as if everything was slightly
tariffs
right tariffs
jake inhales deeply
yeah ii do remember now
im a little fuzzy
you did have a lot of wine
he was thrilled to have someone
who knew the difference
did i
you did
uh
i dont think you noticed
because he kept topping you off
did he
jake yes yes yes
young woman right
i didnt notice that
jake yeah
young woman tricky
jake makes it hard to keep count
it does
as i was saying
all in all i think everything
inhales deeply went well
i think it was a successful visit
mmhmm yes
everyone got to know each other
thats true theyre very nice
you liked them
yes
jake they liked you too
i think that
i think thats a good sign
ssign
sign
sign is perhaps not the right word
the thing
oh
jake the good thing
yeah
jake good thing
its good when people you like
like each other
young woman
people like to think of themselves
as points moving through time
but i think its probably the opposite
were stationary
and time passes through us
blowing like cold wind
stealing our heat
leaving us chapped and frozen
what are you thinking
young woman i dont know dead
i feel like i was that wind tonight
blowing through jakes parents
seeing them as they were
seeing them as they will be
seeing them after theyre gone
what are you
young woman when only im left
what are you thinking
young woman only the wind
not much
really
im tired jake the wine i guess
yes you did have a lot
yes
it is a depressant as you know
of course i know
i think its important for people
to keep that in mind
before they make decisions
under its influence
blows raspberry
both laugh
a woman under the influence
amazing film
im not sure i agree
young woman sniffs
ive been watching that film over and over
for my essay due wednesday
i felt uh a kinship
with mabel i guess
shes such a powerful
horribly wronged character
is she
i think
inhales
exhales
mabel longhetti is bombed out
because shes always trying
to please everyone
so that she can be considered one more
victimheroine for the womens liberation
but only by women liberationists
who are willing to accept
textbook spinoffs as art
the junoesque gena rowlands
mrs cassavetes is a prodigious actress
and she never lets go of the character
i agree ii thought she was
great in the role
seemed to me she she encompassed
young woman now at an indeterminate age
when her beauty has deepened
beyond ingenue roles
rowlands can look old or young
shades of expression
transform mabel longhetti from
stammers
a radiantly flirtatious beauty
into a sad sagging neighborhood drunk
rowlands externalizes
schizophrenic dissolution
mabel fragments before your eyes
a threering circus
might be taking place in her face
rowlands performance is enough
for half a dozen tours de force
a whole row of oscars its exhausting
conceivably
she is a great actress but
nothing she does is memorable
because she does so much
inhales deeply
exhales
its the most transient
big performance ive ever seen
i guess im unclear
what you mean by transient
mabel tries to slash her wrist
nick puts a bandaid on the cut
the idiot symbolism is enough
to make you want to hoot
but this twohour and 35minute movie
leaves you too groggy
to do more than moan
details that are meant to establish
the pathological nature
of the characters surrounding mabel
stammers and so show her isolation
become instead limp false moments
its unclear whether the characters
are unconscious
or whether its cassavetes
whos unconscious of what hes doing
the children keep murmuring
that they love her
theres no clue
as how to decipher that refrain
are they coddling her
reversing roles and treating her
like a child in need of reassurance
or are they as unashamedly loving
as she is
and what are what are we to make
of nick the pulpers
constant assertations
is assertations even a word
i thought it was assertions
theyre both words look it up
what are we to make of nick the pulpers
constant assertations of love
the the movie is entirely tendentious
its all planned yet it isnt thought out
wind howling
jake inhales deeply
exhales
i do see what youre saying
you are certainly the expert
on things cinematic
yeah
i am
jake ii guess i was just
inhales deeply
taken in
by the the sympathy
that cassavetes showed for her
i feel like maybe our society
lacks a certain kindness
a certain willingness
to take in the struggles of others
stammers struggling with uh
issues caused by
young woman an alienating society
i dont know
uh i guess
yeah it seems hopeless
what does
jake sighs
jake all of it uh everything
like feeling old
like your body is going
your hearing your sight
you cant see and youre invisible
inhales deeply
and youve made so many wrong turns
the lie of it all
what is the lie of it all
jake i dont know that
its going to get better
that its never too late
that inhales
god has a plan for you
that age is just a number
shut up
that
inhales deeply
its always darkest
before the dawn that
every cloud has a fucking silver lining
deep breath
blows raspberry
that theres
that theres someone for everyone
blows raspberry
platitudes all
blows raspberry
shut up mabel sit down mabel
blows raspberry
blows raspberry
and god never gives us
more than we can bear
gods a good egg that way
hey do you want something sweet
what do you mean
dessert
didnt we have dessert at your moms
i feel like there was
this huge cake thing or
chuckles
true
i guess im a sugar junkie
laughs
i dont know
inhales deeply
it might help me stay awake
then definitely
we need jake awake for a bit
this is all so treacherous
theres a tulsey town
just at the turnoff up ahead
young woman a tulsey town
laughs
open now in this its freezing
it is perfect weather for a brrr
laughs
dont you think
yeah i guess it is
gettin tulsey town
both  were here to soft serve
tulsey town
huh
jesus i never thought of that before
what do you suppose tulsey town is
jake based on the clown
laughing
id say its a circus town
maybe like that place
uh where the sideshow folks go
during off season
ruled by the clown lady
ah
well yes she wears a crown
she has a
clown crown
laughs
a benevolent and tolerant
ice cream clown queen
young woman laughs
made entirely of lactose
she is lactose tolerant
shes sweet but cold
young woman like your mum
laughs
what do you mean
nothing i dont know why i said that
that just came out
did you think of my mother as cold
young woman no
uh she was lovely she really was
cause i dont
subscribe to that
the mother is the cause
of all psychological problems crap
thats misogynistic claptrap
freudian bullshit
it is tempting
to have someone to pin it on though
chuckles
pin what on
all of it why you feel a certain way
why you are a certain way
thats misogynistic claptrap
freudian bullshit
a person an adult has to
at one point or another
take responsibility for who they are
dont you think
yeah
yes
young woman mothers are people
with their own pain
their own history of neglect and abuse
yet at one time or another
during the 20th century every fucking
childhood trait was blamed on them
schizophrenia autism
narcissism homosexuality
not that homosexuality is akin
to any of those other things
uh yeah of course not
obviously
saying that a mother is to blame
for her childs homosexuality
is to imply that homosexuality
is somehow negative
i was just saying that when homosexuality
was considered a pathology
in the dsm before 1973
a coddling mother
was often seen as the culprit
right
jake inhales deeply
exhales
its despicable how we label people
and categorize them and dismiss them
sighs
i look at the kids
i see at school every day
i see the ones who are ostracized
theyre
different theyre out of step
and i see the lives theyll have
because of that
sometimes i see them years later
in town at the supermarket
stammering i see
i can tell that they still carry
that stuff around with them
like a
black aura
like a millstone
like an oozing wound
jake
im thinking
here tada
young woman oh man thats brutal
brutal place the land of tulsey town
climate change here too
have you read the novel ice
young woman i dont think so
jake by anna kavan
i dont think so
jake 1967 its a fable of sorts
about
lets just get the ice cream and go
its freezing
wait a minute
i just want to see whos on tonight first
young woman you know the people
who work here
some of them
well i stop sometimes
after visiting my parents
i dont like some of the girls
that work here so i just wanna make sure
young woman whats wrong with them
i dont know people
can be cold to me
uh im gonna wait in the car
jake no no say hello
they wont come if they know its me
knocking
hello anybody here
woman in a minute
so ice takes place
young woman sighs
during uh
an environmental cataclysm
causing the world to become
a frozen wasteland
knocking
and the main
young woman groans
woman hi
hi

uh
so yeah uh ill have uh
oreo brr
and hell have
stammering
same

two sames
giggles
women giggling

women giggling

varnishing in the back
varnishing
shelves
young woman oh no problem
young woman i know this girl

tip of my brain as jake says
shes someone shes from somewhere
im certain of it
shivering
its a fucking blizzard out there
surprised you were open
on a night like this
its a fucking blizzard out there
fucking brrr in here
yeah ii
i was thinking the exact same thing
youre kind
women giggle
youre not like them
vapid and mean and pretty
thanks a lot
i didnt mean it like that
i love the way you look
you you have a kindness
and of course youre very attractive
i didnt mean it like that
its ok i understand
its uh
its just there seem
seems to be a
certain hardness that comes
with a certain kind of pretty
you dont have that
maybe they suffer too the pretty ones
i dont know maybe
maybe their prettiness
causes them suffering
im not a psychiatrist
young woman what an odd thing to say
of course shes not a psychiatrist
she cant be more than 15
made them extra high
since youre so nice
thanks
itll be eight dollars please
jake
jake breathes deeply
keep the change
thank you
youre welcome thanks
im worried
excuse me
i shouldnt be saying this
you ok do you need me to call for help
its not varnish
thats not why it smells
you should know that
what do you mean
you dont have to go
i dont have to go where
forward in time you
you can stay here
im very scared
about what what are you scared about
woman im scared for you
thank you
women giggling
have a good night be careful
the roads are treacherous
women giggling
car door opens
young woman sighs
women giggling
car door opens
engine turns over
car door closes
car door closes
you notice that girls arms
which girl
in the tulsey town
jake which girl there were several
several there were three
several is anything more than two
really
mmhmm look it up
young woman look it up
can you stop saying that
anyway the one the one with the rash
all over her arms
i didnt notice
youre being willfully obtuse
not my intention
mockingly not my intention
anyway
jake hows the brrr
too sweet
yeah its sweet
i always forget how sweet these are
a little goes a long way
i dont think i can eat anymore of mine
you barely touched it
its very sweet
clears throat
yeah
it is a lot
inhales sharply
cold
yeah the ice cream i guess
were in the middle of a snow storm
inhales deeply
whose idea was it to go to tulsey town
in the middle of all this anyway
i am not saying a word
jake laughs
young woman laughs
young woman how odd
this is probably the last time
ill ever be in a car with jake
soon thisll all be a distant memory
well both be in different places
remembering this moment
this shared laugh
and maybe therell be regret
young woman laughing
young woman inhales deeply
maybe time will soften
the harder edges and
well both think that was sort of nice
why did it have to end
and theres no way back at that point
theres never a way back
you got quiet all of a sudden
young woman just watching the storm
if you cant even tell the other person
what youre thinking
that doesnt bode well
jake looks like youre done with it
what do you mean
bit of a wasted stop
young woman sniffs
at least i can say ive been
to tulsey town in the middle of the night
in the middle of nowhere
in the middle of a snowstorm
im your favorite clown
from tulsey town
where ice cream grows on trees
so have no fear come and join me here
eat as much as you please
i will turn your frown
fully upside down
when you take your very first bite
of vanilla chocolate or strawberry
and were open day and night
thats something ill never do again
jake a supposedly fun thing
youll never do again
yes
jake have you have you read that
read what
its a book of essays
by david foster wallace
inhales deeply
nope i have not
exhales
its a book a book of essays
ah no i havent read it
we should we should find some place
to dump these
theyre going to melt
and get the cup holders all sticky
young woman hmm
ok
hmm
jake hes got this essay in it
about television
jake clears throat
pretty people tend to appeal
pretty people tend to be
more pleasing to look at
than nonpretty people
but when were talking about television
the combination of sheer audience size
and quiet psychic intercourse
between images and oglers
starts a cycle that both enhances
pretty images appeal
and erodes us viewers
own sense of security
in the face of gazes
that thats from the essay
thats
thats interesting
he killed himself
yeah yeah ii think i knew that
jake yeah everybody knows it
even people who know nothing else
about david foster wallace
never read a word of his writing
suicide becomes the story
the mythology
the cautionary tale its obnoxious
its obnoxious
i dont think we know how
to be human anymore
who doesnt
jake our society our culture people
whatever all this is
any of us
young woman well have you ever read
any guy debord
the society of the spectacle
exactly yes
yes of course
debord says
the spectacle cannot be understood
as a mere visual deception
produced by mass media technologies
it is a worldview
that has actually been materialized
watch the world through this glass
preinterpreted for us
and it infects our brains we become it
whispers like a virus
listen these these melting things
are are driving me crazy
theyre going to get
everything all sticky
well have you got a plastic bag
or something
no no nothing like that
a napkin maybe
i want to find a place to dump them
well there doesnt seem
to be anything around here
theres a small road
up ahead of us that i know of
therell therell be a garbage can
sighs i dont know
may maybe we should just head home
to the farm
no to the city
im worried
were gonna get stuck out here
if we turn off the main road
and get stuck no ones gonna find us
its not stammering
im not going to feel right if i dont
get rid of these itll prey on my mind
ok shit
shit
banging
hey hey its not its its not
its
its not a big deal
really
i know that ames
young woman ames
i know that
young woman is that short for amy
that doesnt sound right
that doesnt seem like my name
or my nickname
jake lets go here real quick
and ill get to show you my high school
this
this goes to a high school
jake my high school
where i spent every tortured day sighs
for so long
for so goddamn long
can we just turn around
this doesnt feel right
jake i dont understand

young woman it feels wrong
i cant turn around
the road is too narrow
ill just get to the school
well dump the cups and well leave
okno iii dont
i dont know what this is
it doesnt make any sense to me
how do school buses get down here
its a rural high school
yeah i went i grew up on a farm
i went to a rural high school
we there was a there was a
stammering a normal entrance
with a paved fucking road
its fine everything is tinged
ok thats the thing
you have to realize
its tinged
colored by mood by emotion
by past experience
there is no objective reality
you know theres no color
in the universe right
only in the brain
just electromagnetic frequencies
the brain tinges them
yes i am a physicist
i know what color is
yes yes yes you are
you do
color is the deeds of light
its the deeds and suffering
thats beautiful
its not physicist talk
but eminently poetic
yeah well i am a poet after all
jake you are its beautiful
this road seems excessively long
seems
thats the operative word
time is another thing
that exists only in the brain
and yet we get older
older and older older and older
or so it seems
sometimes i feel
im much younger
than i actually am
like still a kid inside
until i pass a mirror
is younger better
yes exhales
i think so its admirable
scoffs
young woman youth is admirable
how can you admire a person for their age
its like admiring a certain point
in a stream
its healthier
its brighter
its more fun
more attractive hopeful
young woman
like a cocacola commercial
almost all groundbreaking work
in science and the arts
is done by young people
old people are the ash heap of youth

jesus the song was written in 1936
chuckling its not about roofies
roofies or not hes trying to break down
her defenses with strong liquor

jake my house

i dont i dont know
if you were here when
when he was a student
i mean how would i know anyway i
you havent seen anyone around here

janitor what does your boyfriend
look like
its hard to describe people
it was so long ago i barely remember
i mean
we never even talked
is the truth im not even sure
i registered him theres a lot of people
i was there with my girlfriend
we were celebrating our anniversary
stopped in for a drink
and then this guy
kept looking at me
its a nuisance
the occupational hazard of
of being a female
you cant even go for a drink
always being looked at
he was a creeper you know
stammers and i remember thinking
i wish my boyfriend was here
which is
thats sort of sad
that being a woman
the only way a guy leaves you alone
is if youre with another guy
like if like
like youve been claimed
like youre property even then
anyway i cant
i cant remember what he looks like
why would i
nothing happened
maybe it was just
sniffs
i think it was just
just one of thousands
of such noninteractions in my life
laughing
its like asking me to describe
a mosquito that bit me
on an evening 40 years ago
sighs
well you havent seen anyone
fitting that description have you
i havent seen anyone
young woman ok
i mean
except you i see you
im im
im a little worried about him
im sure theres no need
hes safe if hes here

near the end of a long fruitful life
in acknowledgment for the work i did

through the physical the metaphysical

inhales sharply
and back
and i have made the most important
discovery of my career

applause
prop clattering
the floor creaks
the door squeaks
theres a field mouse
anibblin on a broom
and i sit by myself
like a cobweb on a shelf
by myself
in a lonely room
but when theres a moon in my winder
and it slants down a beam
cross my bed
then the shadder of a tree
starts adancin on the wall
and a dream starts adancin
in my head
and all the things that i wish fer
turn out like i want them to be
and im better
than that smartaleck cowhand
who thinks hes better than me
and the girl that i want
aint afraid of my arms
and her own soft arms keep me warm
and her long tangled hair
falls across my face
just like the rain
in a storm
wind whistling
the floor creaks
the door squeaks
and a mouse starts anibbling
on the broom
and the sun flicks my eyes
it was all a pack o lies
im awake
in a lonely room
i aint gonna dream of her arms
no more
i aint gonna leave her alone
goin outside
git myself a bride
git me a woman to call
my own
audience applause
sobs happily
engine struggling
