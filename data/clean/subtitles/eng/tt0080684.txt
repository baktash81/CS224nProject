stupid little short circuit
hell be quite all right
sir all the patrols are in

mistress leia r2 says hes been
quite unable to pick up any signals
although he does admit that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope
your highness
theres nothing more we can do tonight
the shield doors must be closed
close the doors
yes sir
r2 says the chances of survival are 725 to 1
gahhh
actually r2 has been known to make mistakes
from time to time
oh dear oh dear
dont worry about master luke
im sure hell be all right
hes quite clever you know for a human being

to see you fully functional again
thanks 3 po
r2 expresses his relief also
how ya feelin kid
you dont look so bad to me
you look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark
thanks to you
thats two you owe me junior
well your worship
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer
i had nothing to do with it
general rieekan thinks its dangerous
for any ships to leave the system
until weve activated the energy field
thats a good story
i think you just cant bear to let
a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight
i dont know where
you get your delusions laser brain
hah hah hah
laugh it up fuzzball
but you didnt see us alone
in the south passage
she expressed her true feelings for me
my
why you stuckup halfwitted
scruffylooking nerf herder
whos scruffylooking
i must have hit pretty close to the mark
to get her all riled up like that huh kid
well i guess you dont know
everything about women yet
headquarters personnel
report to command center
take it easy
excuse us please
princess we have a visitor
picked up something
outside the bases zone 12 moving east
its metal
then it couldnt be one of those creatures
could be a speeder one of ours
no
wait
theres something
very weak coming through
sir im fluent in six million
forms of communication
this signal is not used by the alliance
it could be an imperial code
it isnt friendly whatever it is
come on chewie lets check it out
send rogues 10 and 11 to station 38
grrr
gahhh
im afraid theres not much left
what was it
droid of some kind
i didnt hit it that hard
mustve had a selfdestruct
an imperial probe droid
its a good bet the empire knows were here
wed better start the evacuation
admiral
yes captain
i think weve got something sir
the report is only a fragment
from a probe droid in the hoth system
but its the best lead weve had
we have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy
i want proof not leads
the visuals indicate life readings
it could mean anything
if we followed up every lead
but sir the hoth system
is supposed to be devoid of humans
youve found something
yes my lord
thats it the rebels are there
my lord there are so many
uncharted settlements
it could be smugglers
that is the system
and im sure skywalker is with them
set your course for the hoth system
general veers prepare your men
admiral
groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders
as soon as each transport is loaded
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch
right sir
all right thats it
try it
oh turn it off turn it off
turn it off
sir it will take quite a while
to evacuate the t47s
forget the heavy equipment
theres plenty of time to get
the smaller modules on the transports
take care sir
thanks
chewie take care of yourself o k
ok o k
hi kid
theres got to be a reason for it
check it at the other end
wait a second
you all right
yeah
be careful
you too
general theres a fleet of stardestroyers
coming out of hyperspace in sector four
reroute all power to the energy shield
we gotta hold them till all transports are away
prepare for ground assault
what is it general
my lord the fleet
has moved out of light speed
comscan has detected an energy field protecting
an area of the sixth planet of the hoth system
the field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment
the rebels are alerted to our presence
admiral ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system
hehe felt surprise was wiser
he is as clumsy as he is stupid
general prepare your troops
for a surface attack
yes my lord
lord vader
the fleet has moved out of light speed
and were preparing to
aaugh
you have failed me for the last time admiral
captain piett
yes my lord
make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field
and deploy the fleet
so that nothing gets off the system
you are in command now admiral piett
thank you lord vader
all troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance
the heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as theyre loaded
only two fighter escorts per ship
the energy shield
can only be opened for a short time
so youll have to stay very close
to your transports
two fighters against a stardestroyer
the ion cannon
will fire several shots
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path
when youve gotten past the energy shield
proceed directly to the rendezvous point
understood
good luck
ok everybody to your stations
lets go
their primary target will be
the power generators
prepare to open shield
sir rebel ships are coming into our sector
good our first catch of the day
stand by ion control
fire
the first transport is away
feeling all right sir
just like new dak how about you
right now i feel i could take on
the whole empire myself
i know what you mean
echo station threeteight
weve spotted imperial walkers
imperial walkers on the north ridge
echo station fiveseven were on our way
all right boys keep tight now
luke i have no approach vector
im not set
steady dak
attack pattern delta go now

hobbie you still with me
that armors too strong for blasters
rogue group

ill have to cut in the auxiliary
just hang on hang on dak
get ready to fire that tow cable

r2 you take good care
of master luke now understand

on manual control for a while
gahhh
i saw em i saw em
saw what
stardestroyers
two of em coming right at us
sir sir might i suggest
shut him up or shut him down
check the deflector shield
great
well we can still outmaneuver them
take evasive action
prepare to make the jump
to light speed
3 po but sir
theyre getting closer
oh yeah watch this
watch what
i think were in trouble
if i may say so sir i noticed earlier
the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged
its impossible to go to light speed
were in trouble
horizontal boosters
gahhh
alluvial dampers
ow
thats not it
bring me the hydrospanner
i dont know how
were gonna get out of this one
ow
chewie
that wasnt a laser blast something hit us
han get up here
come on chewie
asteroids
oh no
chewie set twosevenone
what are you doing
youre not actually going
into an asteroid field
theyd be crazy to follow us
wouldnt they
you dont have to do this to impress me
sir the possibility of successfully navigating
an asteroid field is approximately 3720 to 1
never tell me the odds
look out
you said you wanted
to be around when i made a mistake
this could be it sweetheart
i take it back
were going to get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer
aint gonna argue with that
im going in closer to one of the big ones
closer
3 po closer
gahhh
oh this is suicide theres nowhere to go
there that looks pretty good
what looks pretty good
yeah thatll do nicely
excuse me maam
but where are we going
i hope you know what youre doing
yeah me too
yep thats it dagobah
no im not gonna change my mind about this
im not picking up any cities or technology
massive lifeform readings though
theres something alive down there
yes im sure its perfectly safe for droids
i know i know
all the scopes are dead i cant see a thing
just hang on
im gonna start the landing cycle
no r2 you stay put
ill have a look around
r2
r2
where are you
r2
you be more careful
r2 that way
r2
beeep
oh no
are you all right
come on
you were lucky to get out of there
anything broken
if youre saying coming here was a bad idea
im beginning to agree with you
r2 what are we doing here
its like something out of a dream or
i dont know
maybe im just going crazy
yes admiral
our ships have sighted
the millennium falcon lord
but it has entered an asteroid field
and we cannot risk
asteroids do not concern me admiral
i want that ship not excuses
yes lord
im gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems
sir im almost afraid to ask
but does that include shutting me down too
no i need you to talk to the falcon
find out whats wrong with the hyperdrive
sir its quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable
not entirely stable
im glad youre here to tell us these things
chewie take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive
sometimes i just dont understand
human behavior
after all im only trying to do my job
let go
shh
let go please
dont get excited
captain being held by you
isnt quite enough to get me excited
sorry sweetheart
i havent got time for anything else
ready for some power
ok
lets see now
put that in there
there you go
now all i gotta do is find this yoda
if he even exists
its really a strange place
to find a jedi master
this place gives me the creeps
still
theres something familiar about this place
i dont know
i feel like
feel like what
like were being watched
away put your weapon
i mean you no harm
i am wondering why are you here
im looking for someone
looking
found someone you have
i would say hmmm

come come
r2 stay and watch after the camp
oh where is r2 when i need him
sir i dont know where your ship
learned to communicate
but it has the most peculiar dialect
i believe sir it says that the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized
im afraid youll have to replace it
well of course ill have to replace it
here
and chewie
i think wed better replace
the negative power coupling
hey your worship
im only trying to help
would you please stop calling me that
sure leia
you make it so difficult sometimes
i do i really do
you could be a little nicer though
come on admit it
sometimes you think im all right
occasionally maybe
when you arent acting like a scoundrel
scoundrel
i like the sound of that
stop that
stop what
stop that my hands are dirty
my hands are dirty too
what are you afraid of
afraid
youre trembling
im not trembling
you like me because im a scoundrel
there arent enough scoundrels in your life
i happen to like nice men
im a nice man
no youre not youre
sir sir
ive isolated the reverse
power flux coupling
thank you
thank you very much
oh youre perfectly welcome sir
and that was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes
considering the amount of damage weve sustained
they must have been destroyed
no captain theyre alive
i want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found
lord vader
yes admiral what is it
the emperor commands you
to make contact with him
move the ship out of the asteroid field
so that we can send a clear transmission
yes my lord
what is thy bidding my master
there is a great disturbance in the force
i have felt it
we have a new enemy
the young rebel
who destroyed the death star
i have no doubt this boy
is the offspring of anakin skywalker
how is that possible
search your feelings lord vader
you will know it to be true
he could destroy us
hes just a boy
obiwan can no longer help him
the force is strong with him
the son of skywalker
must not become a jedi
if he could be turned
he would become a powerful ally
yes
he would be a great asset
can it be done
he will join us or die master
look im sure its delicious
i just dont understand
why we cant see yoda now
patience
for the jedi
it is time to eat as well
hmm heh heh
eat eat
hot
good food mmm good hmm
how far away is yoda
will it take us long to get there
not far yoda not far
patience soon you will be with him
root leaf
i cook
why wish you become jedi hmm hmm
mostly because of my father i guess
ah father
powerful jedi was he
hee hee mmm powerful jedi
oh come on
how could you know my father
you dont even know who i am
i dont even know what im doing here
were wasting our time
i cannot teach him
the boy has no patience
he will learn patience
hmm
much anger in him
like his father
was i any different when you taught me
no
he is not ready
yoda
i am ready
ben i can be a jedi
ben tell him im
ready are you
what know you ready
for 800 years have i trained jedi
my own counsel will i keep
on who is to be trained
ajedi must have the deepest commitment hmm
the most serious mind
this one a long time have i watched
all his life has he looked away
to the future to the horizon
never his mind on where he was
hmm
what he was doing
hmph
adventure
ha
excitement ha
ajedi craves not these things
you are reckless
so was i if you remember
he is too old
yes too old to begin the training
but ive learned so much
ahh
will he finish what he begins
i wont fail you
im not afraid
oh
you will be
aah
sir if i may venture an opinion
im not really interested in your opinion
theres something out there
where
outside in the cave
there it is listen listen
im going out there
are you crazy
i just got this bucket back together
im not going to let something tear it apart
then im going with you
i think it might be better
if i stay behind and guard the ship
oh no
this ground sure feels strange
it doesnt feel like rock
theres an awful lot of moisture in here
i dont know
i have a bad feeling about this
yeah
watch out
its all right
yeah thats what i thoughtmynock
chewie check the rest of the ship
and make sure there are no more attached
chewing on the power cables
mynocks
go on inside
well clean them off if there are any more
han
aagghh go away go away beastly thing
shoo shoo
wait a minute
lets get out of here
the empire is still out there
i dont think
no time to discuss this in committee
im not a committee
you cant make the jump
to light speed in this asteroid field
sit down sweetheart were taking off
look
i see it i see it
were doomed
the cave is collapsing
this is no cave
what
run
yes ajedis strength flows from the force
but beware of the dark side
anger fear aggression
the dark side of the force are they
easily they flow
quick to join you in a fight
if once you start down the dark path
forever will it dominate your destiny
consume you it will
as it did obiwans apprentice
vader
is the dark side stronger
no no
no
quicker easier more seductive
how do i know
the good side from the bad
you will know when you are calm
at peace
passive
ajedi uses the force
for knowledge and defense
never for attack
but tell me why i cant
no no there is no why
nothing more will i teach you today
clear your mind of questions
hmm
mmm
theres something not right here
i feel cold
death
that place
is strong with the dark side of the force
a domain of evil it is
in you must go
whats in there
only what you take with you
your weapons
you will not need them
hmph
bounty hunters
we dont need their scum
yes sir
those rebels wont escape us
sir we have a priority signal
from the stardestroyer avenger
there will be a substantial reward
for the one who finds the millennium falcon
you are free to use any methods necessary
but i want them alive
no disintegrations
as you wish
lord vader
my lord we have them
oh thank goodness
were coming out of the asteroid field
lets get out of here
ready for light speed
its not fair
gahhh
transfer circuits arent working
its not my fault
no light speed
its not my fault
sir weve just lost
the main rear deflector shield
one more direct hit
on the back quarter and were done for
turn her around
im going to put all power
in the front shield
youre going to attack them
sir the odds of surviving
a direct assault on an imperial
shut up
gaahh
theyre moving to attack position
shields up
track them
they may come around for another pass
captain needa the ship
no longer appears on our scopes
they cant have disappeared
no ship that small has a cloaking device
well theres no trace of them sir
captain lord vader
demands an update on the pursuit
get a shuttle ready
i shall assume full responsibility for losing them
and apologize to lord vader
meanwhile continue to scan the area
yes captain needa
use the force
yes
now the stone
feel it
concentrate
oh no well never get it out now
so certain are you
always with you it cannot be done
hear you nothing that i say
master moving stones around is one thing
this is totally different
no no different
only different in your mind
you must unlearn what you have learned
all right ill give it a try
no try not
do
or do not
there is no try
i cant its too big
size matters not look at me
judge me by my size do you
hmm
hmph
and well you should not
for my ally is the force
and a powerful ally it is
life creates it
makes it grow
its energy surrounds us
and binds us
luminous beings are we
not this crude matter
you must feel the force around you
here between you me
the tree the rock everywhere
yes
even between the land and the ship
you want the impossible
mm
i dont
i dont believe it
that is why you fail
apology accepted captain needa
lord vader our ships have completed
their scan of the area and found nothing
if the millennium falcon went into light speed
itll be on the other side of the galaxy by now
alert all commands
calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory
yes my lord well find them
dont fail me again
admiral
alert all commands
deploy the fleet
captain solo
this time youve gone too far
gahhh
i will not be quiet
why doesnt anyone listen to me
the fleets beginning to break up
go back and stand by
the manual release for the landing claw
i really dont see how thats going to help
surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative
in extreme circumstances
the empire may be gracious enough
thank you
whats your next move
if they follow standard imperial procedure
theyll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed
and then we just float away
with the rest of the garbage
then what
then we got to find a safe port
somewhere around here
any ideas
where are we
the anoat system
theres not much there
no well wait this is interesting
lando
lando system
landos not a system
hes a man lando calrissian
hes a cardplayer gambler scoundrel
youd like him
thanks
bespin its pretty far
but i think we can make it
a mining colony
yeah a tibanna gas mine
lando conned somebody out of it
we go back a long way
lando and me
can you trust him
no but hes got no love for the empire
i can tell you that
here we go chewie stand by
detach
you do have your moments
not many of them
but you do have them
concentrate
feel the force flow
yes
good
calm
yes
through the force things you will see
other places the future the past
old friends long gone
han
leia
hmm
control control
you must learn control
i saw i saw a city in the clouds
hmm
friends you have there
they were in pain
it is the future you see
future
will they die
difficult to see
always in motion is the future
ive got to go to them
decide you must how to serve them best
if you leave now help them you could
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered
no i dont have a landing permit
im trying to reach lando calrissian
wait a minute let me explain
you will not deviate from your present course
rather touchy arent they
i thought you knew this person
gaah
that was a long time ago
im sure hes forgotten about that
permission granted to land
on platform 327
thank you
nothing to worry about
we go way back lando and me

ill get my people to work on her
that ship saved my life quite a few times
shes the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy
hows the gas mine
still paying off for you
not as well as id like
were a small outpost
and not very selfsufficient
ive had supply problems of every kind
ive had labor difficulties
ha ha ha
whats so funny
you listen to you
you sound like a businessman
a responsible leader
whod have thought that huh
seeing you brings back a few things
yeah
yeah im responsible these days
its the price you pay for being successful
ooh nice to see a familiar face
e chu ta
how rude
that sounds like an r2 unit in there
i wonder if hello
how interesting
who are you
oh my i im terribly sorry
i didnt mean to intrude
no please dont get up
gahhh
luke you must complete the training
i cant keep the vision out of my head
theyre my friends i got to help them
you must not go
but han and leia will die if i dont
you dont know that
even yoda cannot see their fate
but i can help them
i feel the force
but you cannot control it
this is a dangerous time foryou
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the force
yes yes to obiwan you listen
the cave remember your failure at the cave
but ive learned so much since then
master yoda i promise to return
and to finish what ive begun
you have my word
it is you and your abilities
the emperor wants
that is why your friends are made to suffer
thats why i have to go
luke i dont want to lose you to the emperor
the way i lost vader
you wont
stopped they must be
on this all depends
only a fully trained jedi knight
with the force as his ally
will conquer vader and his emperor
if you end your training now
if you choose the quick
and easy path as vader did
you will become an agent of evil
patience
and sacrifice han and leia
if you honor what they fight for yes
if you choose to face vader
you will do it alone
i cannot interfere
i understand
r2
fire up the converters
luke
dont give in to hate
that leads to the dark side
strong is vader
mind what you have learned save you it can
i will
and ill return
i promise
told you i did
reckless is he
now
matters are worse
that boy is our last hope
no there is another
the ships almost finished
two or three more things
and were in great shape
the sooner the better something is wrong here
no one has seen or knows anything about 3 po
hes been gone too long to have gotten lost
relax ill talk to lando
and see what i can find out
i dont trust lando
well i dont trust him either
but he is my friend besides
well soon be gone
then youre as good as gone
arent you
gaahh
what happened
gahhh gahhh
where
gahhh
found him in a junk pile
oh what a mess
chewie you think you can repair him
gahhh
landos got people that can fix him
no thanks
im sorry am i interrupting anything
not really
you look absolutely beautiful
you truly belong here with us among the clouds
thank you
would you join me for a little refreshment
everyones invited of course
having trouble with your droid
no no problem
why
you see since were a small operation
we dont fall into
the jurisdiction of the empire
so youre part of the mining guild then
no not actually our operation
is small enough not to be noticed
which is advantageous for everybody
since our customers are anxious
to avoid attracting attention to themselves
arent you afraid the empires going to find out
about this little operation shut you down
its always been a danger that looms
like a shadow over everything weve built
but things have developed
thatll ensure security
ive just made a deal
that will keep the empire out of here forever
we would be honored if you would join us
i had no choice
they arrived right before you did
im sorry
im sorry too
gahhh
no 3 pos with them
just hang on were almost there
gahhh
oh ah ooh ah
im trbly srry
i dndt mn to intrddd
no secret stormtroopers
here were in danger
i must tell the others
oh no ive been shot
aaah
aaaaahhh
lord vader
you may take captain solo to jabba the hutt
after i have skywalker
hes no good to me dead
he will not be permanently damaged
aaaahhh
lord vader
what about leia and the wookiee
they must never again leave this city
that was never a condition
of our agreement
nor was giving han to this bounty hunter
perhaps you think youre being treated unfairly
no
good it would be unfortunate
if i had to leave a garrison here
this deal is getting worse all the time
oh yes thats very good
i like that
oh
somethings not right
because now i cant see
oh oh oh thats much better
wait wait
oh my what have you done
im backwards
you fleabitten furball
only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough
i feel terrible
gahhh
why are they doing this
they never even asked me
any questions
lando
grrr
get out of here lando
shut up and listen
vaders agreed
to turn leia and chewie over to me
theyll have to stay here
but at least theyll be safe
leia what about han
vaders given him to the bounty hunter
vader wants us all dead
he doesnt want you at all
hes after somebody called skywalker
luke
lord vader set a trap for him
and were the bait
hes on his way
you fixed us all real good didnt you
my friend
stop
ive done all i can
im sorry i couldnt do better
but ive got my own problems
yeah
youre a real hero
you certainly have a way with people
ah ah
this facility is crude
but it should be adequate to freeze skywalker
for his journey to the emperor
lord vader
ship approaching xwing class
good monitor skywalker
and allow him to land
lord vader
we only use this facility for carbon freezing
you put him in there it might kill him
i do not want
the emperors prize damaged
we will test it on captain solo
if only youd attached my legs
i wouldnt be in
this ridiculous position
now remember chewbacca
you have a responsibility for me
so dont do anything foolish
whats going on
buddy
youre being put into carbon freeze
what if he doesnt survive
hes worth a lot to me
the empire will compensate you if he dies
put him in
rrrah
rrrah rrrah
han stop chewie stop stop
3 po yes stop please im not ready to die
hey hey listen to me chewie
this wont help me

do you hear me huh
gahhh
i love you
i know
gahhh
whats going on turn around
chewbacca i cant see
gahhh
oh theyve encased him in carbonite
he should be quite wellprotected
if he survived the freezing process that is
well calrissian did he survive
yes hes alive
and in perfect hibernation
hes all yours bounty hunter
reset the chamber for skywalker
skywalker has just landed lord
good see to it that
he finds his way in here
calrissian take the princess
and the wookiee to my ship

but you are not a jedi yet
well done
hold them in the security tower
and keep it quiet move
