a meteorite that hit near him 
with all the meteor activity
in this system 
it s going to be difficult to spot
approaching ships 
general  i got to leave  i can t stay anymore

well  there s a price on my head 
if i don t pay off jabba the hutt

without giving you a good bye kiss 
i d just as soon kiss a wookiee 
i can arrange that 
you could use a good kiss 
i didn t ask you to turn on the thermal heater 
i merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess s chamber 
how will we dry out her clothes 
oh  switch off 
why did you take this apart now 
i m trying to get us out of here  and you pull both 
excuse me  sir

i turned it off 
i don t want to talk to her 
well  princess leia
is wondering about master luke 
he hasn t come back yet 
she doesn t know where he is 
i don t know where he is 
nobody knows where he is 
what do you mean  nobody knows 
well  uh  you see 
deck officer 
deck officer 
excuse me  sir  might i 
yes  sir 
do you know where commander skywalker is 
i haven t seen him 
it s possible he came through
the south entrance 
it s possible 
why don t you go find out 
it s getting dark out there 
yes  sir 
excuse me  sir 
might i inquire what s going on 
why not 
impossible man 
come along  r2  let s find princess leia 
between ourselves 
i think master luke is in considerable danger 
sir  commander skywalker
hasn t come in the south entrance 
he might have forgotten to check in 
not likely  are the speeders ready 
uh  not yet  we re having trouble
adapting them to the cold 
we ll have to go out on tauntauns 
sir  the temperature s dropping too rapidly 
that s right 
and my friend s out in it 
your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker 
then i ll see you in hell  hyah 
rrraaah 
grrrr 
graaah 
you must come along now  r2 
there s really nothing more we can do 
and my joints are freezing up 
don t say things like that 
of course we ll see master luke again 
and he ll be quite all right  you ll see 
stupid little short circuit 
he ll be quite all right 
sir  all the patrols are in 
still no 
still no contact from skywalker or solo 
mistress leia  r2 says he s been
quite unable to pick up any signals 
although he does admit that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope 
your highness 
there s nothing more we can do tonight 
the shield doors must be closed 
close the doors 
yes  sir 
r2 says the chances of survival are 725 to 1 
gahhh 
actually  r2 has been known to make mistakes   
from time to time 
oh  dear  oh  dear 
don t worry about master luke 
i m sure he ll be all right 
he s quite clever  you know  for a human being 
luke 
ben 
you will go to the dagobah system 
dagobah system 
there you will learn from yoda 
thejedi master who instructed me 
ben 
han  luke 
luke 
don t do this  luke 
come on  give me a sign here 
not much time 
ben 
hang on  kid 
dagobah system 
whew 
this may smell bad  kid   
yoda 
but it ll keep you warm   
till i get the shelter up 
ben    dagobah   
ahhh 
ah  i thought they smelled bad on the outside 
echo base  i ve got something 
not much  but it could be a life form 
commander skywalker  do you copy 
this is rogue two 
captain solo  do you copy 
commander skywalker  do you copy 
this is rogue two 
han    good morning 
nice of you guys to drop by 
echo base  this is rogue two 
i ve found them 
repeat  i ve found them 
master luke  sir  it s so good
to see you fully functional again 
thanks  3 po 
r2 expresses his relief also 
how ya feelin   kid 
you don t look so bad to me 
you look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark 
thanks to you 
that s two you owe me  junior 
well  your worship 
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer 
i had nothing to do with it 
general rieekan thinks it s dangerous
for any ships to leave the system
until we ve activated the energy field 
that s a good story 
i think you just can t bear to let
a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight 
i don t know where
you get your delusions  laser brain 
hah hah hah 
laugh it up  fuzzball 
but you didn t see us alone
in the south passage 
she expressed her true feelings for me 
my 
why  you stuck up  half witted 
scruffy looking nerf herder 
who s scruffy looking 
i must have hit pretty close to the mark
to get her all riled up like that  huh  kid 
well  i guess you don t know
everything about women yet 
headquarters personnel 
report to command center 
take it easy 
excuse us  please 
princess  we have a visitor 
picked up something
outside the base s zone 12 moving east 
it s metal 
then it couldn t be one of those creatures 
could be a speeder  one of ours 
no 
wait 
there s something
very weak coming through 
sir  i m fluent in six million
forms of communication 
this signal is not used by the alliance 
it could be an imperial code 
it isn t friendly  whatever it is 
come on  chewie  let s check it out 
send rogues 10 and 11 to station 38 
grrr 
gahhh 
i m afraid there s not much left 
what was it 
droid of some kind 
i didn t hit it that hard 
must ve had a self destruct 
an imperial probe droid 
it s a good bet the empire knows we re here 
we d better start the evacuation 
admiral 
yes  captain 
i think we ve got something  sir 
the report is only a fragment
from a probe droid in the hoth system 
but it s the best lead we ve had 
we have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy 
i want proof  not leads 
the visuals indicate life readings 
it could mean anything 
if we followed up every lead 
but  sir  the hoth system
is supposed to be devoid of humans 
you ve found something 
yes  my lord 
that s it  the rebels are there 
my lord  there are so many
uncharted settlements 
it could be smugglers 
that is the system 
and i m sure skywalker is with them 
set your course for the hoth system 
general veers  prepare your men 
admiral 
groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders 
as soon as each transport is loaded 
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch 
right  sir 
all right  that s it 
try it 
oh  turn it off  turn it off 
turn it off 
sir  it will take quite a while
to evacuate the t 47s 
forget the heavy equipment 
there s plenty of time to get
the smaller modules on the transports 
take care  sir 
thanks 
chewie  take care of yourself  o  k 
o k   o  k 
hi  kid 
there s got to be a reason for it 
check it at the other end 
wait a second 
you all right 
yeah 
be careful 
you  too 
general  there s a fleet of stardestroyers
coming out of hyperspace in sector four 
reroute all power to the energy shield 
we gotta hold them till all transports are away 
prepare for ground assault 
what is it  general 
my lord  the fleet
has moved out of light speed 
comscan has detected an energy field protecting
an area of the sixth planet of the hoth system 
the field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment 
the rebels are alerted to our presence 
admiral ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system 
he he felt surprise was wiser 
he is as clumsy as he is stupid 
general  prepare your troops
for a surface attack 
yes  my lord 
lord vader 
the fleet has moved out of light speed 
and we re preparing to   
aaugh 
you have failed me for the last time  admiral 
captain piett 
yes  my lord 
make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field
and deploy the fleet
so that nothing gets off the system 
you are in command now  admiral piett 
thank you  lord vader 
all troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance 
the heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they re loaded 
only two fighter escorts per ship 
the energy shield
can only be opened for a short time 
so you ll have to stay very close
to your transports 
two fighters against a stardestroyer 
the ion cannon
will fire several shots
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path 
when you ve gotten past the energy shield 
proceed directly to the rendezvous point 
understood 
good luck 
o k  everybody to your stations 
let s go 
their primary target will be
the power generators 
prepare to open shield 
sir  rebel ships are coming into our sector 
good  our first catch of the day 
stand by  ion control 
fire 
the first transport is away 
feeling all right  sir 
just like new  dak  how about you 
right now i feel i could take on
the whole empire myself 
i know what you mean 
echo station three t eight 
we ve spotted imperial walkers 
imperial walkers on the north ridge 
echo station five seven  we re on our way 
all right  boys  keep tight now 
luke  i have no approach vector 
i m not set 
steady  dak 
attack pattern delta  go now 
all right  i m coming in 
hobbie  you still with me 
that armor s too strong for blasters 
rogue group 
use your harpoons and tow cables 
go for the legs 
it might be our only chance of stopping them 
all right  stand by  dak 
oh  luke 
we ve got a malfunction in fire control 
i ll have to cut in the auxiliary 
just hang on  hang on  dak 
get ready to fire that tow cable 
ah 
dak 
dak 
yes  lord vader 
i ve reached the main power generators 
the shield will be down in moments 
you may start your landing 
rogue three 
copy  rogue leader 
wedge  i ve lost my gunner 
you ll have to make this shot 
i ll cover for you 
set your harpoon  follow me on the next pass 
coming around  rogue leader 
steady  rogue two

good shot  janson 
one more pass 
coming around  wedge 
cable out  let her go 
detach cable 
cable detached 
come on 
hah  that got him 
i see it  wedge  good work 
i don t think we can protect
two transports at a time 
it s risky  but we can t hold out much longer 
we have no choice 
launch patrol 
evacuate remaining ground staff 
gahhh 
no  no  no 
this one goes there 
that one goes there  right 
r2  you take good care
of master luke now  understand 
and do take good care of yourself 
 beep beep blip 
oh  dear  oh  dear 
all troops will debark for ground assault 
prepare to target the main generator 
rogue two  are you all right 
yeah  i m with you  rogue leader 
well  set harpoon  i ll cover for you 
coming around 
watch that cross fire  boys 
set for position three 
steady 
stay tight and low 
this is it 
aah 
hobbie 
i ve been hit 
you all right 
why are you still here 
heard the command center
had been hit 
you ve got your clearance to leave 
don t worry  i ll leave 
first i m gonna get you to your ship 
your highness 
we must take this last transport 
it s our only hope 
send all troops in sector 12
to the south slope to protect the fighters 
imperial troops have entered the base 
imperial troops
have entered 
come on  that s it 
give the evacuation code signal 
and get to your transports 
oh  wait for me 
begin retreat  fall back 
distance to power generators 
17 28

wait  wait 
how s this 
would it help if i got out and pushed 
captain solo  captain solo 
it might 
sir  might i suggest that you 
it can wait 
this bucket of bolts
is never gonna get us past that blockade 
this baby s got a few surprises
left in her  sweetheart 
come on  come on 
switch over 
let s hope we don t have a burnout 
see 
someday you re gonna be wrong 
and i just hope i m there to see it 
punch it 
r2 
get her ready for takeoff 
good luck  luke  see you at the rendezvous 
don t worry  r2 
we re going  we re going 
there s nothing wrong  r2 
i m just setting a new course 
we re not gonna regroup with the others 
we re going to the dagobah system 
yes  r2 
that s all right 
i d like to keep it
on manual control for a while 
gahhh 
i saw  em  i saw  em 
saw what 
stardestroyers 
two of  em coming right at us 
sir  sir  might i suggest 
shut him up or shut him down 
check the deflector shield 
great 
well  we can still outmaneuver them 
take evasive action 
prepare to make the jump
to light speed 
3 po  but  sir 
they re getting closer 
oh  yeah  watch this 
watch what 
i think we re in trouble 
if i may say so  sir  i noticed earlier
the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged 
it s impossible to go to light speed 
we re in trouble 
horizontal boosters 
gahhh 
alluvial dampers 
ow 
that s not it 
bring me the hydrospanner 
i don t know how
we re gonna get out of this one 
ow 
chewie 
that wasn t a laser blast  something hit us 
han  get up here 
come on  chewie 
asteroids 
oh  no 
chewie  set two seven one 
what are you doing 
you re not actually going
into an asteroid field 
they d be crazy to follow us 
wouldn t they 
you don t have to do this to impress me 
sir  the possibility of successfully navigating
an asteroid field is approximately 3 720 to 1 
never tell me the odds 
look out 
you said you wanted
to be around when i made a mistake 
this could be it  sweetheart 
i take it back 
we re going to get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer 
ain t gonna argue with that 
i m going in closer to one of the big ones 
closer  
3 po  closer  
gahhh 
oh  this is suicide  there s nowhere to go 
there  that looks pretty good 
what looks pretty good 
yeah  that ll do nicely 
excuse me  ma am 
but where are we going 
i hope you know what you re doing 
yeah  me  too 
yep  that s it  dagobah 
no  i m not gonna change my mind about this 
i m not picking up any cities or technology 
massive life form readings  though 
there s something alive down there 
yes  i m sure it s perfectly safe for droids 
i know  i know 
all the scopes are dead  i can t see a thing 
just hang on 
i m gonna start the landing cycle 
no  r2  you stay put 
i ll have a look around 
r2 
r2 
where are you 
r2 
you be more careful 
r2  that way 
r2 
beeep 
oh  no 
are you all right 
come on 
you were lucky to get out of there 
anything broken 
if you re saying coming here was a bad idea 
i m beginning to agree with you 
r2  what are we doing here 
it s like    something out of a dream or   
i don t know 
maybe i m just going crazy 
yes  admiral 
our ships have sighted
the millennium falcon  lord 
but it has entered an asteroid field 
and we cannot risk 
asteroids do not concern me  admiral 
i want that ship  not excuses 
yes  lord 
i m gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems 
sir  i m almost afraid to ask 
but does that include shutting me down  too 
no  i need you to talk to the falcon 
find out what s wrong with the hyperdrive 
sir  it s quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable 
not entirely stable 
i m glad you re here to tell us these things 
chewie  take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive 
sometimes i just don t understand
human behavior 
after all  i m only trying to do my job 
let go 
shh 
let go  please 
don t get excited 
captain  being held by you
isn t quite enough to get me excited 
sorry  sweetheart 
i haven t got time for anything else 
ready for some power 
o k 
let s see now 
put that in there 
there you go 
now all i gotta do is find this yoda   
if he even exists 
it s really a strange place
to find a jedi master 
this place gives me the creeps 
still   
there s something familiar about this place 
i don t know 
i feel like 
feel like what 
like we re being watched 
away put your weapon 
i mean you no harm 
i am wondering    why are you here 
i m looking for someone 
looking 
found someone you have 
i would say  hmmm

help you i can  yes  mmmm 
i don t think so 
i m looking for a great warrior 
ah 
a great warrior 
ha ha ha 
wars not make one great 
put that down 
hey  that s my dinner 
how you get so big
eating food of this kind 
listen  friend  we didn t mean
to land in that puddle 
and if we could get our ship out  we would 
but we can t  so why don t you 
cannot get your ship out  hee hee hee 
hey  get out of there 
ah

i don t want your help  i want my lamp back 
i m gonna need it to get
out of this slimy mudhole 
mudhole  slimy 
my home this is 
wha mmm 
r2  let him have it 
mine  mine  mine  mine 
r2 
now  will you move along  little fellow 
we ve got a lot of work to do 
no  no  no

i m not looking for a friend 
i m looking for a jedi master 
oh  jedi master  yoda

you know him 
mmmm  take you to him i will 
yes  yes  but now we must eat  come 
good food 
come 
come  come 
r2    stay and watch after the camp 
oh  where is r2 when i need him 
sir  i don t know where your ship
learned to communicate 
but it has the most peculiar dialect 
i believe  sir  it says that the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized 
i m afraid you ll have to replace it 
well  of course i ll have to replace it 
here 
and  chewie   
i think we d better replace
the negative power coupling 
hey  your worship 
i m only trying to help 
would you please stop calling me that 
sure  leia 
you make it so difficult sometimes 
i do  i really do 
you could be a little nicer  though 
come on  admit it 
sometimes you think i m all right 
occasionally    maybe   
when you aren t acting like a scoundrel 
scoundrel 
i like the sound of that 
stop that 
stop what 
stop that  my hands are dirty 
my hands are dirty  too 
what are you afraid of 
afraid 
you re trembling 
i m not trembling 
you like me because i m a scoundrel 
there aren t enough scoundrels in your life 
i happen to like nice men 
i m a nice man 
no  you re not  you re 
sir  sir 
i ve isolated the reverse
power flux coupling 
thank you 
thank you very much 
oh  you re perfectly welcome  sir 
and that was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes 
considering the amount of damage we ve sustained 
they must have been destroyed 
no  captain  they re alive 
i want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found 
lord vader 
yes  admiral  what is it 
the emperor commands you
to make contact with him 
move the ship out of the asteroid field
so that we can send a clear transmission 
yes  my lord 
what is thy bidding  my master 
there is a great disturbance in the force 
i have felt it 
we have a new enemy 
the young rebel
who destroyed the death star 
i have no doubt this boy
is the offspring of anakin skywalker 
how is that possible 
search your feelings  lord vader 
you will know it to be true 
he could destroy us 
he s just a boy 
obi wan can no longer help him 
the force is strong with him 
the son of skywalker
must not become a jedi 
if he could be turned 
he would become a powerful ally 
yes 
he would be a great asset 
can it be done 
he will join us or die  master 
look  i m sure it s delicious 
i just don t understand
why we can t see yoda now 
patience 
for the jedi 
it is time to eat as well 
hmm  heh heh 
eat  eat 
hot 
good food  mmm  good  hmm 
how far away is yoda 
will it take us long to get there 
not far  yoda not far 
patience  soon you will be with him 
root leaf 
i cook 
why wish you become jedi  hmm  hmm 
mostly because of my father  i guess 
ah  father 
powerful jedi was he 
hee hee  mmm  powerful jedi 
oh  come on 
how could you know my father 
you don t even know who i am 
i don t even know what i m doing here 
we re wasting our time 
i cannot teach him 
the boy has no patience 
he will learn patience 
hmm   
much anger in him 
like his father 
was i any different when you taught me 
no 
he is not ready 
yoda 
i am ready 
ben  i can be a jedi 
ben  tell him i m 
ready  are you 
what know you ready 
for 800 years have i trained jedi 
my own counsel will i keep
on who is to be trained 
ajedi must have the deepest commitment  hmm 
the most serious mind 
this one a long time have i watched 
all his life has he looked away   
to the future  to the horizon 
never his mind on where he was 
hmm 
what he was doing 
hmph 
adventure 
ha 
excitement  ha 
ajedi craves not these things 
you are reckless 
so was i  if you remember 
he is too old 
yes  too old to begin the training 
but i ve learned so much 
ahh   
will he finish what he begins 
i won t fail you 
i m not afraid 
oh   
you will be 
aah 
sir  if i may venture an opinion 
i m not really interested in your opinion 
there s something out there 
where 
outside in the cave 
there it is  listen  listen 
i m going out there 
are you crazy 
i just got this bucket back together 
i m not going to let something tear it apart 
then i m going with you 
i think it might be better
if i stay behind and guard the ship 
oh  no 
this ground sure feels strange 
it doesn t feel like rock 
there s an awful lot of moisture in here 
i don t know 
i have a bad feeling about this 
yeah 
watch out 
it s all right 
yeah  that s what i thought mynock 
chewie  check the rest of the ship
and make sure there are no more attached 
chewing on the power cables 
mynocks 
go on inside 
we ll clean them off if there are any more 
han 
aagghh  go away  go away  beastly thing 
shoo  shoo 
wait a minute   
let s get out of here 
the empire is still out there 
i don t think   
no time to discuss this in committee 
i m not a committee 
you can t make the jump
to light speed in this asteroid field 
sit down  sweetheart  we re taking off 
look 
i see it  i see it 
we re doomed 
the cave is collapsing 
this is no cave 
what 
run 
yes  ajedi s strength flows from the force 
but beware of the dark side 
anger  fear  aggression 
the dark side of the force are they 
easily they flow 
quick to join you in a fight 
if once you start down the dark path 
forever will it dominate your destiny 
consume you it will 
as it did obi wan s apprentice 
vader 
is the dark side stronger 
no  no 
no 
quicker  easier  more seductive 
how do i know
the good side from the bad 
you will know when you are calm 
at peace 
passive 
ajedi uses the force
for knowledge and defense 
never for attack 
but tell me why i can t 
no  no  there is no why 
nothing more will i teach you today 
clear your mind of questions 
hmm   
mmm   
there s something not right here 
i feel cold   
death 
that place   
is strong with the dark side of the force 
a domain of evil it is 
in you must go 
what s in there 
only what you take with you 
your weapons   
you will not need them 
hmph   
bounty hunters 
we don t need their scum 
yes  sir 
those rebels won t escape us 
sir  we have a priority signal
from the stardestroyer avenger 
there will be a substantial reward
for the one who finds the millennium falcon 
you are free to use any methods necessary 
but i want them alive 
no disintegrations 
as you wish 
lord vader 
my lord  we have them 
oh  thank goodness
we re coming out of the asteroid field 
let s get out of here 
ready for light speed 
1   
2   
3 
it s not fair 
gahhh 
transfer circuits aren t working 
it s not my fault 
no light speed 
it s not my fault 
sir  we ve just lost
the main rear deflector shield 
one more direct hit
on the back quarter and we re done for 
turn her around 
i m going to put all power
in the front shield 
you re going to attack them 
sir  the odds of surviving
a direct assault on an imperial 
shut up 
gaahh 
they re moving to attack position 
shields up 
track them 
they may come around for another pass 
captain needa  the ship
no longer appears on our scopes 
they can t have disappeared 
no ship that small has a cloaking device 
well  there s no trace of them  sir 
captain  lord vader
demands an update on the pursuit 
get a shuttle ready 
i shall assume full responsibility for losing them
and apologize to lord vader 
meanwhile  continue to scan the area 
yes  captain needa 
use the force 
yes 
now  the stone   
feel it 
concentrate 
oh  no  we ll never get it out now 
so certain are you 
always with you it cannot be done 
hear you nothing that i say 
master  moving stones around is one thing 
this is totally different 
no  no different 
only different in your mind 
you must unlearn what you have learned 
all right  i ll give it a try 
no  try not 
do 
or do not 
there is no try 
i can t  it s too big 
size matters not  look at me 
judge me by my size  do you 
hmm 
hmph 
and well you should not 
for my ally is the force 
and a powerful ally it is 
life creates it 
makes it grow 
its energy surrounds us   
and binds us 
luminous beings are we 
not this crude matter 
you must feel the force around you 
here  between you  me 
the tree  the rock  everywhere 
yes   
even between the land and the ship 
you want the impossible 
mm   
i don t   
i don t believe it 
that is why you fail 
apology accepted  captain needa 
lord vader  our ships have completed
their scan of the area and found nothing 
if the millennium falcon went into light speed
it ll be on the other side of the galaxy by now 
alert all commands 
calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory 
yes  my lord  we ll find them 
don t fail me again   
admiral 
alert all commands 
deploy the fleet 
captain solo 
this time you ve gone too far 
gahhh 
i will not be quiet 
why doesn t anyone listen to me 
the fleet s beginning to break up 
go back and stand by
the manual release for the landing claw 
i really don t see how that s going to help 
surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative
in extreme circumstances 
the empire may be gracious enough 
thank you 
what s your next move 
if they follow standard imperial procedure 
they ll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed 
and then we just float away 
with the rest of the garbage 
then what 
then we got to find a safe port
somewhere around here 
any ideas 
where are we 
the anoat system 
there s not much there 
no  well  wait  this is interesting 
lando 
lando system 
lando s not a system 
he s a man  lando calrissian 
he s a cardplayer  gambler  scoundrel 
you d like him 
thanks 
bespin  it s pretty far 
but i think we can make it 
a mining colony 
yeah  a tibanna gas mine 
lando conned somebody out of it 
we go back a long way 
lando and me 
can you trust him 
no  but he s got no love for the empire 
i can tell you that 
here we go  chewie  stand by 
detach 
you do have your moments 
not many of them 
but you do have them 
concentrate 
feel the force flow 
yes 
good 
calm 
yes 
through the force  things you will see 
other places  the future  the past 
old friends long gone 
han 
leia 
hmm   
control  control 
you must learn control 
i saw    i saw a city in the clouds 
hmm   
friends you have there 
they were in pain 
it is the future you see 
future 
will they die 
difficult to see 
always in motion is the future 
i ve got to go to them 
decide you must how to serve them best 
if you leave now  help them you could 
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered 
no  i don t have a landing permit 
i m trying to reach lando calrissian 
wait a minute  let me explain 
you will not deviate from your present course 
rather touchy  aren t they 
i thought you knew this person 
gaah 
that was a long time ago 
i m sure he s forgotten about that 
permission granted to land
on platform 3 2 7 
thank you 
nothing to worry about 
we go way back  lando and me 
who s worried 
oh  no one to meet us 
i don t like this 
well  what would you like 
they did let us land 
look  don t worry 
everything s going to be fine 
trust me 
see  my friend 
keep your eyes open  huh 
gahhh 
hey 
why  you slimy 
double crossing  no good swindler 
you ve got a lot of guts coming here
after what you pulled 
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
how you doin   you old pirate 
so good to see you 
well  he seems very friendly 
yes 
very friendly 
what are you doing here 
ah  repairs 
i thought you could help me out 
what have you done to my ship 
your ship 
hey  remember 
you lost her to me fair and square 
and how you doin   chewbacca 
gahh 
you still hanging around
with this loser 
gahhh 
hello  what have we here 
welcome  i m lando calrissian 
i m the administrator of this facility 
and who might you be 
leia 
welcome  leia 
all right  all right  you old smoothie 
hello  sir  i am c 3po  human cyborg relations 
my facilities are at your   
well  really 
what s wrong with the falcon 
hyperdrive 
i ll get my people to work on her 
that ship saved my life quite a few times 
she s the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy 
how s the gas mine 
still paying off for you 
not as well as i d like 
we re a small outpost
and not very self sufficient 
i ve had supply problems of every kind 
i ve had labor difficulties 
ha ha ha 
what s so funny 
you  listen to you 
you sound like a businessman 
a responsible leader 
who d have thought that  huh 
seeing you brings back a few things 
yeah 
yeah  i m responsible these days 
it s the price you pay for being successful 
ooh  nice to see a familiar face 
e chu ta 
how rude 
that sounds like an r2 unit in there 
i wonder if    hello 
how interesting 
who are you 
oh  my  i  i m terribly sorry 
i didn t mean to intrude 
no  please don t get up 
gahhh 
luke  you must complete the training 
i can t keep the vision out of my head 
they re my friends  i got to help them 
you must not go 
but han and leia will die if i don t 
you don t know that 
even yoda cannot see their fate 
but i can help them 
i feel the force 
but you cannot control it 
this is a dangerous time foryou 
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the force 
yes  yes  to obi wan you listen 
the cave  remember your failure at the cave 
but i ve learned so much since then 
master yoda  i promise to return
and to finish what i ve begun 
you have my word 
it is you and your abilities
the emperor wants 
that is why your friends are made to suffer 
that s why i have to go 
luke  i don t want to lose you to the emperor
the way i lost vader 
you won t 
stopped they must be 
on this all depends 
only a fully trained jedi knight 
with the force as his ally 
will conquer vader and his emperor 
if you end your training now 
if you choose the quick
and easy path  as vader did 
you will become an agent of evil 
patience 
and sacrifice han and leia 
if you honor what they fight for    yes 
if you choose to face vader 
you will do it alone 
i cannot interfere 
i understand 
r2 
fire up the converters 
luke 
don t give in to hate 
that leads to the dark side 
strong is vader 
mind what you have learned  save you it can 
i will 
and i ll return 
i promise 
told you  i did 
reckless is he 
now   
matters are worse 
that boy is our last hope 
no  there is another 
the ship s almost finished 
two or three more things
and we re in great shape 
the sooner the better  something is wrong here 
no one has seen or knows anything about 3 po 
he s been gone too long to have gotten lost 
relax  i ll talk to lando
and see what i can find out 
i don t trust lando 
well  i don t trust him either 
but he is my friend  besides   
we ll soon be gone 
then you re as good as gone 
aren t you 
gaahh 
what happened 
gahhh gahhh 
where 
gahhh 
found him in a junk pile 
oh  what a mess 
chewie  you think you can repair him 
gahhh 
lando s got people that can fix him 
no  thanks 
i m sorry  am i interrupting anything 
not really 
you look absolutely beautiful 
you truly belong here with us among the clouds 
thank you 
would you join me for a little refreshment 
everyone s invited  of course 
having trouble with your droid 
no  no problem 
why 
you see  since we re a small operation 
we don t fall into
the jurisdiction of the empire 
so you re part of the mining guild  then 
no  not actually  our operation
is small enough not to be noticed 
which is advantageous for everybody 
since our customers are anxious
to avoid attracting attention to themselves 
aren t you afraid the empire s going to find out
about this little operation  shut you down 
it s always been a danger that looms
like a shadow over everything we ve built 
but things have developed
that ll ensure security 
i ve just made a deal
that will keep the empire out of here forever 
we would be honored if you would join us 
i had no choice 
they arrived right before you did 
i m sorry 
i m sorry  too 
gahhh 
no  3 po s with them 
just hang on  we re almost there 
gahhh 
oh ah ooh ah 
im trbly srry 
i dndt mn to intrddd 
no  secret  stormtroopers 
here  we re in danger 
i must tell the others 
oh  no  i ve been shot 
aaah 
aaaaahhh 
lord vader 
you may take captain solo to jabba the hutt
after i have skywalker 
he s no good to me dead 
he will not be permanently damaged 
aaaahhh 
lord vader 
what about leia and the wookiee 
they must never again leave this city 
that was never a condition
of our agreement 
nor was giving han to this bounty hunter 
perhaps you think you re being treated unfairly 
no 
good  it would be unfortunate
if i had to leave a garrison here 
this deal is getting worse all the time 
oh  yes  that s very good 
i like that 
oh 
something s not right
because now i can t see 
oh  oh  oh  that s much better 
wait  wait 
oh  my  what have you done 
i m backwards 
you flea bitten furball 
only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough 
i feel terrible 
gahhh 
why are they doing this 
they never even asked me
any questions 
lando 
grrr 
get out of here  lando 
shut up and listen 
vader s agreed
to turn leia and chewie over to me 
they ll have to stay here 
but at least they ll be safe 
leia  what about han 
vader s given him to the bounty hunter 
vader wants us all dead 
he doesn t want you at all 
he s after somebody called skywalker 
luke 
lord vader set a trap for him 
and we re the bait 
he s on his way 
you fixed us all real good  didn t you 
my friend 
stop 
i ve done all i can 
i m sorry i couldn t do better 
but i ve got my own problems 
yeah 
you re a real hero 
you certainly have a way with people 
ah    ah   
this facility is crude 
but it should be adequate to freeze skywalker
for his journey to the emperor 
lord vader 
ship approaching  x wing class 
good  monitor skywalker
and allow him to land 
lord vader 
we only use this facility for carbon freezing 
you put him in there  it might kill him 
i do not want
the emperor s prize damaged 
we will test it on captain solo 
if only you d attached my legs 
i wouldn t be in
this ridiculous position 
now remember  chewbacca 
you have a responsibility for me 
so don t do anything foolish 
what s going on 
buddy 
you re being put into carbon freeze 
what if he doesn t survive 
he s worth a lot to me 
the empire will compensate you if he dies 
put him in 
rrrah 
rrrah  rrrah 
han  stop  chewie  stop  stop 
3 po  yes  stop  please  i m not ready to die 
hey  hey  listen to me  chewie 
this won t help me 
hey  save your strength 
there will be another time 
the princess   
you have to take care of her 
do you hear me  huh 
gahhh   
i love you 
i know 
gahhh 
what s going on  turn around 
chewbacca  i can t see 
gahhh 
oh  they ve encased him in carbonite 
he should be quite well protected 
if he survived the freezing process  that is 
well  calrissian  did he survive 
yes  he s alive 
and in perfect hibernation 
he s all yours  bounty hunter 
reset the chamber for skywalker 
skywalker has just landed  lord 
good  see to it that
he finds his way in here 
calrissian  take the princess
and the wookiee to my ship 
you said they d be left in the city
under my supervision 
i am altering the deal 
pray i don t alter it any further 
gahhh 
luke  luke  don t  it s a trap 
it s a trap 
the force is with you  young skywalker 
but you are not a jedi yet 
well done 
hold them in the security tower 
and keep it quiet  move 
what do you think you re doing 
we re getting out of here 
i knew all along  it had to be a mistake 
do you think that after what you did to han 
we re going to trust you 
grrr 
i had no choice 
what are you doing  trust him  trust him 
we understand  don t we  chewie 
he had no choice 
i m just trying to help 
we don t need any of your help 
haaa   
grrr 
ha    ha   
what 
han   
it sounds like han 
there s still a chance to save han   
at the east   
platform 
chewie 
i m terribly sorry about all this 
after all  he s only a wookiee 
put captain solo in the cargo hold 
r2  r2  where have you been 
wait  turn around  you woolly   
hurry  hurry 
we re trying to save han from the bounty hunter 
well  at least you re still in one piece 
look what s happened to me 
oh  no  chewie  they re behind you 
you have learned much  young one 
you ll find i m full of surprises 
your destiny lies with me  skywalker 
obi wan knew this to be true 
no 
aaah 
all too easy 
perhaps you re not as strong
as the emperor thought 
impressive 
most impressive 
aaah 
obi wan has taught you well 
you have controlled your fear 
now   
release your anger 
only your hatred can destroy me 
ohh 
the security code has been changed 
r2  you can tell the computer
to override the security systems 
r2  hurry 
attention  this is lando calrissian 
attention  the empire
has taken control of the city 
i advise everyone to leave
before more imperial troops arrive 
this way 
well  don t blame me  i m an interpreter 
i m not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal 
ah  we re not interested
in the millennium falcon s hyperdrive 
it s fixed 
just open the door  you stupid lump 
i never doubted you for a second 
wonderful 
ouch  oh  that hurts 
bend down  you thoughtless ow 
leia

of course i ve looked better 
you are beaten 
it is useless to resist 
don t let yourself be destroyed
as obi wan did 
uh 
aah 
there is no escape 
don t make me destroy you 
luke 
you do not yet realize your importance 
you have only begun to discover your power 
join me  and i will complete your training 
with our combined strength 
we can end this destructive conflict
and bring order to the galaxy 
i ll neverjoin you 
if you only knew the power
of the dark side 
obi wan never told you
what happened to your father 
he told me enough 
he told me you killed him 
no 
i am your father 
no 
that s not true 
that s impossible 
search your feelings  you know it to be true

luke

our tractor beam in moments  lord
