they were slaggin  you off a bit 
no  no  no  dave 
you know how it is in rock n roll

all right  all right 
  autographs now  is it 
  at least i can write me own name 
you re a smart boy  yeah 
don t start me now  don t fuckin  start me

  i turn my back for 30 seconds 
  i m leavin  this fuckin  band

look  don t take it personally  jimmy 
they ll all come crawlin  back

for all i care 
o sing unto the lord a new song 
for he s done marvellous things 
psalm 98 
you lied to me  joey  i always bought
everythin  you told us  but you lied to me 
i m sorry you doubt me  brother rabbitte 
in time you ll realise
what you ve achieved 
  i ve achieved nothin  
  you re missing the point 
the success of the band was irrelevant 
you raised their expectations of life 
you lifted their horizons 
sure  we could have been famous 
but that would have been predictable 
this way it s poetry 
it s a pisser is what it is  joey 
hey  man    you know a nightclub
called gallagher s 
yeah  it s just around the corner 
but it s closed now 
should we go back
to the hotel  mr pickett 
ok 
fuck 
so how did you feel at the time  jimmy 
well  sick  i can tell yeh  terry 
what happened to everybody
after you split up 
well  all sorts of things  terry 
i still see derek and outspan 
they re still in the music business 
mostly in grafton street 
i try to help them out whenever i can 
and bernie 
last i heard  she was in
a country and western band 
but you know bernie  nice girl 
but she had terrible taste in music 
and  of course  dean is still
playin  tossers  music 
although  i must admit 
he got quite good in the end 
and billy 
what happened to him  jimmy 
god knows  terry  the last i heard  he d
been kicked in the head shoeing a horse 
steven became a doctor  of course 
but he says he misses the music 
say   
and mickah 
he has his own band 
believe it or not  terry 
quite a success  considering
he should be locked up 
imelda married dopey greg 
there s a kid on the way  apparently 
he won t let her sing any more 
shame  really  she had a nice voice 
deco got his recording contract 
he s an even bigger prick now 
oh  excuse my language  terry 
how about natalie  jimmy 
she became very successful 
as you know  terry 
is it true about you and her 
don t believe all you read
in the papers  terry 
but  yes  it s true to say
we are fond of one another 
and joey 
what happened to him  jimmy 
natalie saw his mum the other day  terry 
she said she had a postcard from him 
he was playin  with joe tex
on a north american tour 
only thing is  terry  joe tex died in 1982 
so  lookin  back  jimmy 
what have you learned from your
experience with the commitments 
well  that s a tricky question  terry 
but  as i always say 
we skipped the light fandango 
turned cartwheels  cross the floor 
i was feelin  kinda seasick 
but the crowd called out for more 
that s very profound  jimmy 
what does it mean 
i m fucked if i know  terry 
all you ve gotta do 
is try a little tenderness 
oh  yeah  baby
