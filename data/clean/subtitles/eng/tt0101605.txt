but is there any problems with the band
they were slaggin you off a bit
no no no dave
you know how it is in rocknroll
once they get a taste
they become overnight arseholes
isnt everybody in rocknroll an arsehole
except for management that is
all right all right

for all i care
o sing unto the lord a new song
for hes done marvellous things
psalm 98
you lied to me joey i always bought
everythin you told us but you lied to me
im sorry you doubt me brother rabbitte
in time youll realise
what youve achieved
ive achieved nothin
youre missing the point
the success of the band was irrelevant
you raised their expectations of life
you lifted their horizons
sure we could have been famous
but that would have been predictable
this way its poetry
its a pisser is what it is joey
hey man you know a nightclub
called gallaghers
yeah its just around the corner
but its closed now
should we go back
to the hotel mr pickett
ok
fuck
so how did you feel at the time jimmy
well sick i can tell yeh terry
what happened to everybody
after you split up
well all sorts of things terry
i still see derek and outspan
theyre still in the music business
mostly in grafton street
i try to help them out whenever i can
and bernie
last i heard she was in
a country and western band
but you know bernie nice girl
but she had terrible taste in music
and of course dean is still
playin tossers music
although i must admit
he got quite good in the end
and billy
what happened to him jimmy
god knows terry the last i heard hed
been kicked in the head shoeing a horse
steven became a doctor of course
but he says he misses the music
say
and mickah
he has his own band
believe it or not terry
quite a success considering
he should be locked up
imelda married dopey greg
theres a kid on the way apparently
he wont let her sing any more
shame really she had a nice voice
deco got his recording contract
hes an even bigger prick now
oh excuse my language terry
how about natalie jimmy
she became very successful
as you know terry
is it true about you and her
dont believe all you read
in the papers terry
but yes its true to say
we are fond of one another
and joey
what happened to him jimmy
natalie saw his mum the other day terry
she said she had a postcard from him
he was playin with joe tex
on a north american tour
only thing is terry joe tex died in 1982
so lookin back jimmy
what have you learned from your
experience with the commitments
well thats a tricky question terry
but as i always say
we skipped the light fandango
turned cartwheels cross the floor
i was feelin kinda seasick
but the crowd called out for more
thats very profound jimmy
what does it mean
im fucked if i know terry
