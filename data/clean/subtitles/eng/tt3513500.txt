  okay  kids  have fun at school 
     that pops into your head   
  bye  dad 
     when i say chip  n dale 
  hey  stop bumping me 
i m willing to bet
it s thomas chippendale 
the london based
cabinet maker from the 1700s 
sick cabinet  thomas 
but i bet the second thing
that pops into your head are these guys 
but certainly  third would be
those rascally cartoon chipmunks 
chip  n dale 
or should i say chip and me 
and it all started the day we met 
when i had to join a new school
in the middle of third grade 
hello  potential new friends 
we have a new student today 
everyone  say hello to dale 
hello  everyone  nice to meet you 
 student coughs

   kids screaming 
   crying

 sighs 
 indistinct chatter 
 groans 
dale  by lunchtime 
no one wanted anything to do with me 
so  i had to sit alone 
   sighs 
  hey  mind if i sit 
that pencil thing you did was hilarious 
it was excellent comic timing 
  really  i kind of wish i hadn t done it 
  no way  man 
the biggest risk
is not taking any risk at all 
you just didn t set up the joke right 
i can help you if you want 
  the name s chip 
  i m dale 
so  do you watch crispy cow 
  hey  that s my milk

dale  and i never thought about anything 
we were perfect together 
friendship is rare
do you know what   
  chip  come on 
  dale  and even though 
  we were in the same grade

   chip was like the older brother

he introduced me to cheesy crust pizza
and funny  old movies 
   both grunt 
   kids laugh 
dale  by high school we were headlining
the talent show 
and for our grand finale 
the amazing dale will juggle everything 
hey

  we had finally done it 
  go slipping
  dale  our own tv show 
  through the cracks
dale  it was about a group
of little detectives   
 but these two  gumshoes
    who would solve big crimes 
  there was the adventurer  monterey jack

  dale  the inventor  gadget hackwrench   
  ch    ch    ch    chip  n dale

  a double threat 
  when there s danger

with chip as the logical straight man   
  pass me that pipe  i ve got an idea 
     and me as the fun loving goof

     baloo 
  well  now 
who here likes a little jazz music 
look for the bare necessities
 the simple bare necessities
  sighs 
pardon moi  dale  but your followers

oh  uh     chuckles 
  i guess    not 
   unsettling music playing 
   music stops abruptly 
  yeah  you know what 
that s great 
when one of us succeeds  we all succeed 
baloo was part of the disney afternoon
just like me

bravo  dale 
your positivity is infectious  oh  merci 
oh  i really needed that cash

yes  dale  your cg surgery
was done very tastefully 
  you look amazing 
  well  thank you  tigra 
  we should hang out sometime 
  nah 
  meanly fast 
  no offense 
but don t you think you d have more fans
here if chip did these events with you 
oh  chip  oh  that s interesting 
i hadn t thought about him in a while 
i should give him a call 
see how life s treating him 
life is the worst 
which is why you need good insurance 
look  i m not gonna put
on the hard sell  but in my experience 
bad things happen all the time 
they happen without warning 
sometimes from the last place
you d expect it 
and you re left to pick up the pieces 
so  you have to protect yourself 
if you re prepared for the worst 
the worst isn t so bad 
so  why risk it  it s my job
to pull the wool off your eyes   
  figuratively 
  you know  i ll take the whole package 
fantastic  you re making the right choice 
hey  hey  congrats

 chuckles nervously  come on  fellas 
this is a genuine dinglehopper 
it s worth a lot  oh 
monterey  so  they kidnap the bloke 
erase his mouth so he can t scream 
then change him around to try to sneak by
the copyright laws 
and then smuggle him overseas

where he ll spend the rest of his life
being forced to make
terrible bootleg movies 
oh  no  that s awful

from that long ago 
oh  okay  i mean  you can care a little
if you want to  i mean  i care  but   
  so  what s been up with you 
  oh  you know this  that 
other vague things
to fill the space of this conversation 
  okay  well  you look the same 
  yeah  thanks  and you look    different 
ah  hey  it s no secret
i had the cgi surgery done
and it s done wonders
rejuvenating my career 
i m actually starring in a play tonight   
but  man  i tell you
the real hot ticket is rescue rangers 
there s even some buzz about a reboot 
someone started a facebook fan page
  for it and everything 
  crikey  a facebook fan page 
  they don t just give those away 
  oh  he s full of it  monty 
no one s talking about
a rescue rangers reboot except for him 
what  the fans are hungry for it 
look  i came here to help monty 
not get caught up
in some hollywood nonsense 
so  great to take this skip
down memory lane 
but i ve gotta go 
monty  if you re really in trouble 
you know how to find me 
dale  you were also here 
 soft jazz music playing 
come over to try and help monty 
ambush me  talking about a reboot   
think they can squeeze a dollar
out of essentially nothing 
he s the one that quit the show
in the first place 
i ve been fine without it 
it s garbage  total garbage 
that s why it s better
to not even have friends 
okay  yeah  that one looks pretty good 
male voice 1  so weird  i mean   
male voice 2  it s  like 
 what are you talking about  
totally  hey  guys  you wanna hang
after the show tonight 
i know a great place
for cheesy crust pizza 
oh  um  i m sorry  man 
but we got other plans  you know 
yeah 
i think the ironic guest performer
wants to be friends 
 laughter 
 cell phone ringing 
go for dale 
e t  forgive bat 
fine 
 sobs  yeah  right 
like that would happen 
   millie whines 
   cell phone buzzing 
   clears throat  hello 
  hey  it s dale  don t hang up 
look  i just got a call from the police
and monty s been kidnapped 
  what  are you serious 
  yeah  it s crazy 
the cops want a statement from us
since we were
the last people he talked to 
i m gonna head back
to his apartment 
i ll meet you there  okay 
 indistinct radio chatter 
 sirens 
 dramatic music playing 
 elevator dings 
  chip  you re here 
  of course  come on 
 indistinct chatter 
poor monty 
huh 
toad  take this to the lab 
you re the friends of the victim 
you got anything for me 
any known enemies or threats 
yeah  actually  monty told me
he was in debt to the valley gang 
he was afraid of being bootlegged
since he was somewhat of a star
in the early  90s   chuckles 
he was on the rescue rangers 
we were on the show together 
chip  n dale  rescue rangers 
  when you need help  just call   
  never heard of it 
  what 
  this is my fault  i shouldn t have left 
well  it eats me up inside
to have to tell you this 
but if he s been taken by the valley gang 
i doubt we can help you 
we ve been trying for years
to track those sleaze bags 
a fella named sweet pete 
runs the whole operation 
  and he s always one step ahead of us 
  what 
so  that s it  i    i thought
that cops were supposed
to serve and protect 
not give up and move on 
hey  i d give anything
to make a case against those scum 
sweet pete s got his fingers
in every illegal business
from bootlegging to stinky cheese 
getting rich while we look like
we just fell off the turnip truck 
  all done  sir 
   exclaims 
oh  you scared the beans out
of me  steckler 
sorry  sir 
  i searched the perimeter  no clues 
  yeah  of course not  why would there be 
six missing toons
in a month and not one clue 
well  maybe we should check in
with the neighbors 
  see if anyone saw anything 
  oh  yeah  you think 
why don t you just
leave the real detective work to me  okay 
   laughing  sheesh 
  right  sorry  sir 
chief  the press are outside
waiting for a statement 
   groans  do i have anything on my back 
  ellie  yes  sir 
it looks like a monopoly game piece
and officer o hara 
officer  what the    ugh  just want one
day where my shirt stays clean 
okay  pack it up  boys 
let s go 
hey   chuckles 
  i m ellie steckler  uh  i am a huge fan 
  really 
i actually became a detective
because as a little girl
growing up in albany 
i wanted to help people 
  just like you guys 
  no way  we are so honored  namaste 
you know that was just
a tv show  right  not real 
chip  inspiration is inspiration 
look  i heard
what putty was saying to you guys 
but i don t think it s hopeless 
i m breaking some rules telling you this 
but from everything
that we know about bootlegging 
the whole process takes about two days 
  that s 48 hours 
  yeah 
ellie  the problem is 
we don t know where
sweet pete s bootlegging facility is 
and every time we try to get a warrant 
we get so bogged down in red tape
that nothing happens 
but if you guys can find
that bootlegging facility 
i think you ll find your friend 
wow  thank you  and thank you again
for watching the show 
  it really means a lot 
  you are gross 
   chuckles  i ll be in touch 
  dale  you re amazing 
 chuckles 
eh 
  chip  what 
  you heard her 
  we should go find monty ourselves 
  are you kidding 
  no  who better to rescue monty 
  uh  literally anyone 
 cause from where i am standing 
there s only one crime fighting team
that can solve this case 
i ll call gadget and zipper 
no  don t bother them 
we re as much real detectives
  as the scooby doo gang 
  exactly  that s why we have to try 
no  what 
chip  monty called
both of us looking for help
and we let him down 
we can t just let him rot
in some overseas studio 
being forced to make bad movies 
if he s gonna make bad movies 
he should be making them here with me 
 sighs  okay  even if we were
going to help 
we have no idea where to start 
we don t even know what we re   
 sniffs  cheese 
   grunts 
  uh  okay  hey  listen 
buddy  if you re low
on cash or something 
  i can buy you a nice  clean sandwich 
  okay  aha 
here it is  i threw this out
when i came over earlier 
 bjornson s cheese shop 
3344  main street  
um  did you just find a clue 
you literally just sniffed out a clue 
look  we can go to the cheese shop 
see what we can find out
about this secret facility
and sweet pete 
then pass it along to the officer lady 
but that s all we re gonna do 
so  you re saying
the rescue rangers are back 
no  because there s no such thing
as rescue rangers  case closed 
   case  
  no  this is not a case
  because we re not real detectives 
  oh ho ho  but you did say case  yes 
 laughs 
   engine revvs 
   heroic music playing 
 music ends abruptly 
   sighs  can i help you 
  sorry   chuckles 
i m just happy to see you 
chip  n dale  together again

chipmunk sized cars  right 
duh  but human stuff is the best 
a little work done on her 
and she ll be back to her glory days 
hey  watch out 
do you know what a metaphor is  dale 
if you re about to say
this car is a metaphor
for something about me  you can stop 
because  no 
i don t know what a metaphor is 
look  if we re gonna solve   
   dramatic jazz music 
  dale   the case of the missing monty  
that s just a placeholder name 
open to any ideas 
  we re gonna have to work together 
  we are not working together 
 laughs  you re funny  chip 
   laughs 
  ugh   
chip  okay  we re getting close 
pull up over there 
and leave the top hat
and cane in the car  please 
 laughs  whoa  how did you know that 
   cause you re you 
  all right  heads up 
well     grunts     there s no faster way
to gain someone s respect
than to dress like
an important business magnet 
you mean business  magnate  
uh  i think i know my own character  chip 
and he wears a top hat 
chip  ah  this place is pretty shady 
are we sure it s safe 
dale  no  because nothing s safe   
 grunts 
   on main street 
 whimsical music playing 
oh  wow  it seems kinda nice 
it s not what i pictured 
trust me  it s worse 
it s a bunch of cartoons trading
on their wholesome public image
to keep the cops away 
and bring you
the slimiest backwater bazaar
of contraband this side of guadalajara 
you sure about that 
that dog s blowing bubbles 
hello 
nothing  and i mean nothing
is sacred in this part of town 
bread for sale  bread for sale
 everyone loves bread for sale
 that guy  he sells untraceable weapons 
scoot  scoot
a shiny shoe makes the man
a shiny shoe  now there s a plan
stolen social security numbers 
roses are a way
  to make a girl feel pretty   
  no  thanks  kid 
  muppet fights 
  okay  why do you know all this 
well  sometimes when i m low on cash 
i sell my fur to that wig shop 
hey  far out

 chip  ah  here 
  it s a stinky  it s a gooey

but hey  before we get into all that 
do me a favor  take a look at this photo 
it s a friend of mine named monterey jack 
which is also the name of a cheese 
  continue 
  right 
so  we think he s being held
in a warehouse somewhere 
if you know anything 
i m sure we could make it
worth your while 
like  what would you say to some
complementary rv or boat insurance 
nah  i don t know nothin  
now  either buy some cheese or get out 
oh  okay  um   
 chuckles  well  perhaps we should 
with the disrespectful tone
this felted clodhopper takes 
why  i never 
  what are you doing 
  i am an important business magnet 
i shall have no trouble
attracting other suitors
for my gigantic deal
because that s what magnets do 
they attract business 
no  you two are definitely cops 
you re out of here 
okay  hold on 
this is getting out of hand 
  we are not cops 
  we re actors   laughs 
it s been us  chip  n dale 
the whole time 
huh  interesting  my boss 
sweet pete  he loves actors 
  ah  yeah  who doesn t   chuckles

from outside the club to the vip room 
wow  this vip room is incredible 
i m freaking out  dude 
 gasps  is that jessica rabbit over there 
i m only asking because i m zip tied
  in the back of a truck 
  whoa  what s with the attitude 
we were about to get
kicked out with your plan 
and now  thanks to my sweet improv 
we re going to see sweet pete 
oh  you re insane

  so  you d rather just give up 
  no 
  you wanna just wait around   
  you should ve just let me take the lead 
 both quarreling in high pitched voices 
hey  hold on a second 
how adorable are we 
chemistry like this doesn t just happen 
this has got reboot written all over it 
ugh  are you serious

millie is probably worried sick
and peeing all over the place 
oh  are you seeing someone 
she sounds    nice 
  she s a dog  millie is a dog 
  ah  i m sure she s not that bad 
  what  no  she s   
   loud crashing 
 truck door slams 
we re here 
whoa  this place looks weird 
where are we 
   cat screeches 
   objects rattle 
dale  okay 
i think we re in the valley 
  the uncanny valley 
  the what 
do you remember that weird
animation style in the early 2000s
where everything looked real 
but nothing looked right 
oh  yeah  that stuff was creepy 
well  i think this is where they ended up 
bjornson  come on  this way   laughing 
 humming 
  bob  what 
  i got something for sweet pete 
  a little gift from bjornson 
  bob  okay  leave it there 
good luck  dummies   laughs 
blend  cheese  curd  blend   
 sinister music playing 
  who are you 
  is he talking to us 
i can t tell 
he s got those polar express eyes 
  uh  are you talking to us 
  obviously  i said   who are you  
well  right  but in fairness 
it looks like you re talking
  to that window 
  no  it actually looks like
  i m looking right at you 
  okay 
look at my eyes 
looking right at your eyes 
  yeah

 machinery buzzing  beeping 
i wonder if they re keeping monty in here 
there s only one way to find out 
so  is this your secret
bootlegging facility or what 
  come on 
  what  no  what are you talking about 
this is sweet pete s legit business 
it s for old merchandise
that never got sold 
  old merchandise 
  yeah  like for example 
  you remember shrek body wash 
  chip  uh   
bob  exactly  no one does  it didn t sell 
that s why sweet pete
bought all the inventory 
and melts it down for its useful parts 
the guy has a real eye for business 
i wish i could see what he sees 
i m sure there s corrective lenses
or something you could get  ow  what 
so  he turns the toys into toy lets 
 laughs 
wow  that s been staring at me for years 
and i never pieced it together   laughs 
here we are 
 chip and dale scream  pant 
hello 
  peter pan 
  sweet pete  yup 
star of stage and screen 
but you can call me sweet pete 
  oh  you look   
  old  bald  sad like a zoo gorilla 
  what  no  not like a zoo gorilla 
  don t worry 
you can t say nothing to me
i haven t heard already  jimmy  please 
untie our guests 
 grunts 
chip and dale  wow 
you mind if i walk while we talk 
not fitting into the old costume
like i used to  need to get my steps in 
hey  i ve got one of those 
we should link accounts
and help motivate each other 
right  so  i m guessing you two are here
to talk about monterey jack 
  oh  yeah  actually we are 
  you know  i always liked monty 
it s a shame what happened 
too much cheese  not enough bread 
listen  mr  sweet pete    mr  pete 
we d be willing to pay
whatever monty owes you
if you could give him a break 
just this once 
hmm   give him a break  
you know  i got my big break
when i was just a kid  i got cast
in the biggest movie in the world 
as the boy who wouldn t grow up 
peter pan 
i d never been so happy in my entire life 
then i got older 
and they threw me away like i was nothing 
this business can be so tough
 scoffs  you said it 
i was scared  desperate  and all alone 
so  i decided to take the power back
and make my own bootleg movie 
i called it  flying bedroom boy  
and guess what  it worked 
i made lots of money 
so  i recruited other toons 
to star in more movies
and bang a rang  now i run
my own bootleg movie studio 
where i get to decide who s a star 
and who gets thrown in the trash 
and now  you two come
poking around where you don t belong 
asking questions
about your missing friend 
and i can t have that 
so  how s this for a break 
i m thinking it s time
for a chip  n dale reboot 
  jimmy   
  you  come with me 
  yup  we re dead 
  run 
 jimmy growls 
go  go  go  go  go   grunts 
  sweet pete  just grab them already 
  jimmy  i m trying   growls 
come on  ready  jump 
 both scream  grunt 
ah   grunts

look for a way out of here 
  jimmy  hey

  chip  hate this  hate this 
  dale  oh  god 
   cell phone ringing 
   both pant

 laughs  my agent is so weird 
dale  try to grab something 
 chip grunts

  no  no 
 both scream  gasp 
 both scream  gargle 
there  the paddle ball 
  ready  jump   grunts 
   grunts 
  whoa 
  whoa 
hold on 
  whoa 
  whoa 
 screams  groans 
 screams  grunts  groans 
 groans  pants 
dale  hello 
dale   breathes heavily 
oh  no  dale 
come on  don t  uh 
don t prank me like this 
 screams  sobs 
  i should ve   
  what s up 
not now  dale 
 sobs  dale  you re alive  but how 
the name s munk  dale munk 
   chuckles 
  ugh  double 0 dale  of course 
chip  you were crying 
you really do love me 
  what  no  i    you were crying 
  aw 
  can we   
  chippy  chippy  i love you too 
don t make it about you 
i was traumatized 
  aw 
  just leave it alone  okay 
okay  fine  well  that whole day
was a big waste 
we didn t learn anything
of value except for that
sweet pete wears
the same step tracker that i do 
wait  those step trackers 
do they keep track of everywhere you go 
yeah  i know because i like
to map my runs in the shape of a butt 
   chuckles 
  i can t believe i m saying this 
but we need to go talk to ellie 
and then  i m going home 
dale  okay  but please just don t tell her
about the butt thing 
  chip  i can t promise that 
   dale groans 
do you think she ll think
it s funny  though 
thanks 
so  if we could get a hold
of sweet pete s step tracker 
we could cross reference where he s been 
with where we know he goes 
right  and whatever doesn t overlap
has got to be his secret facility 
exactly  we get the step tracker 
and we can trace it to find monty 
  chip  you re a genius 
  so  what s the plan 
how are you guys gonna get
sweet pete s step tracker 
 you guys   hold on 
we got you the info you needed 
now  it s up to you  the professional 
to actually  you know  get the bad guy 
  and save our friend monty 
  it s not as simple as that 
we need warrants  we need probable cause 
and i don t know if you guys noticed 
but the captain doesn t really
value my opinion too much 
  what  he s crazy 
  no  i really screwed up 
last year  when peppa pig went missing 
i fell for a bogus tip 
and made the whole squad
raid nickelodeon junior studios 
and the toons fought back 
paw patrol attacked sergeant henderson 
the doctors say he ll never have kids 
huh  thank you for sharing
that absolutely bonkers story 
 gasps  i think i have exactly
what we need  don t move 
ladies and gentlemen 
behold  the crime lab 
 garage door opens 
what   laughs  this is crazy 
pretty sweet  right  all the disguises
and gadgets we could ever need 
wait  is this like every episode
of rescue rangers ever 
  yes  it is 
   sighs  you ve got them all 
 catteries not included  
 throw mummy from the train  
 dirty rotten diapers  
okay  so what s your favorite episode 
ooh  i    i can t pick one

 chuckles  same  so good   laughs 
i m honestly surprised

i didn t think you cared
about the show back then 
what  of course i did 
no  yeah  of course 
what s this huge map
with all the pins in it 
oh  that  it s actually very cool 
oh  no  is this where
all the victims are buried 
 chuckles  you re messing with me again 
it actually shows rescue rangers  ratings
in every us market in 1991
which  as you may recall 
was our most successful year 
hey  ellie  didn t you say
you were from albany 
born and raised 
well  according to this map
rescue rangers never aired in albany 
yeah  my grandma  she used to tape
all the episodes and send them to me 
  hmm 
  grandmas rule   chuckles 
oh  come on  chip 
look at all this cool stuff 
like this is the limited edition
rescue rangers pog set 
you know  this turned
into a real collectible 
because someone noticed
that one of the clouds
behind monterey jack
looked exactly like    oprah 
wow  so cool 
i know  right 
unfortunately  i only have 11 of the 12 
i m missing the main one
of all of us together 
ah  it s just old junk 
okay  guys  sweet pete goes
to the russian bathhouse every wednesday 
so  how are we gonna
sneak you guys in there
without being recognized
by all those goons 
  wait  what if we did episode 45 
  forty five 
  that s a good idea 
  no idea what you re referring to 
and do you have any original ideas 
or are you just
constantly recycling old scripts 
oh  come on  episode 45 
you dressed up like a rat to fool me 
you don t remember 
you said   rats what i m talking about  
it was hilarious 
oh    nope  no clue 
ellie  if we do this 
we could really use your help

 groans 
 buzzer buzzes 
 chuckles  go yanks  and hot dogs

  guys  come on

  first off  stop encouraging this guy

there is nothing more pathetic
than an old cartoon character
  trying to seem cool again by rapping 
  chip  i hear you 
but i don t think
we have much of a choice 
oh  there s a choice 
when it comes to rapping 
there s always a choice

  and i m in hell 
oh  wow  hold on  i need to film this

 chuckles  once you rhyme dale with whale 
you can t think of anything else 
  just devour him  make it stop 
  not me  no  i would just eat the tail
hmm

eat whale
first of all  they re endangered

once they re involved
somehow whatever s wrong
gets solved
