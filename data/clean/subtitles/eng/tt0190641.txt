who am i 
since the beginning   
   humans and pokémon alike
have searched for its meaning 
what am i  what am i 
many strange and wondrous
legends evolved   
   from the pursuit
of life  s mysteries 
where am i  where am i 
but none is stranger
than this tale   
   of the most powerful
pokémon of all 
i am ready   
    to be  to be    
where   
   am i 
this is not the same 
was everything before just a dream 
why 
 doctor  look at this 
 what 
its brain waves  they re surging 
 let me see 
 she s right 
 let s run another scan 
 lts mind is racing 
those voices 
i hope we don t lose this one 
they re outside 
we can t 
where i must be 
tell giovanni what s happened 
quiet 
let us hear its psychic powers 
psychic powers 
for years we struggled to successfully
clone a pokémon to prove our theories 
you re the first specimen to survive 
that is mew  the rarest of all pokémon 
from its dna we created you  mewtwo 
mewtwo 
am i only a copy 
nothing but mew s shadow 
you are greater than mew 
improved through the power
of human ingenuity 
we used the most advanced techniques
to develop your psychic powers 
so i am simply the end
result of your experiment 
what becomes of me now 
our experiment isn t over 
it s just beginning 
now the serious testing begins 
these humans  they care
nothing for me 
congratulations  we ve
done an excellent job 
 we ll observe mewtwo for mutations 
 ls the new tank ready 
we ll have to come up
with a cage for it 
excellent  we ll start testing 
is that my purpose 
am i just an experiment 
a laboratory specimen 
this cannot be my destiny 
we dreamed of creating
the world s strongest pokémon   
   and we succeeded 
behold my powers 
i am the strongest pokémon in the world 
stronger even than mew 
those fools thought you
were a science experiment   
   but i see you as
a valuable partner 
partner 
with your psychic powers
and my resources   
   together we can control the world 
i do not need your help
for that  human 
a wildfire destroys
everything in its path 
it will be the same with your
powers unless you control them 
i can help you do that 
how 
i ll show you a way
to focus your powers   
   that will make you invincible 
show me 
you say this armor protects my body   
   yet it suppresses my powers 
your powers are not being
suppressed  they re being focused 
learn to use them to
accomplish your purpose 
what is that 
patience  my friend  your
purpose will become clear 
so this is my power 
i am in control now 
alakazam 
kazam 
but why am i here 
now i fully perceive my power 
but what is my purpose 
to serve your master 
you were created to fight for me 
that is your purpose 
that cannot be 
you said we were partners 
we stood as equals 
you were created by humans
to obey humans 
you could never be our equal 
humans may have created me   
   but they will never enslave me 
this cannot be my destiny 
stop this now 
i was not born a pokémon 
i was created 
my creators have used and betrayed me 
so i stand alone 
who am l 
what is my true reason for being 
i will find my own purpose 
and purge this planet
of all who oppose me 
human and pokémon alike 
the world will heed my warning 
the reign of mewtwo will soon begin 
today  ash  brock and misty are taking
a break from their pokémon adventures 
as always  ash is determined
to become a pokémon master 
and  as always  he s ready to endure
any hardship  bear any burden   
    with strength  stamina
and a will of steel 
hungry  need food 
oh  ash  you haven  t
done a thing all day 
i m too weak to work  misty 
i haven t eaten since breakfast 
this lunch is going to
be just perfect for you 
it s my lazy boy  no chew  stew 
you there  i m looking for a pokémon
trainer named ash from pallet town 
 you know him 
 yeah  he s me 
let s have a match 
unless you re afraid to lose 
i m afraid you re going
to lose this one 
ash  you just said you
were too weak to work 
i am too weak to work  but
a pokémon battle isn t work 
that s progress  at least
his mouth is working 
i want to be the very best
like no one ever was
to catch them is my real test
to train them is my cause
i will travel across the land
searching far and wide
teach pokémon to understand
the power that s inside
inside pokémon
it s you and me
i know it s my destiny
you re my best friend
and the world we must defend
our hearts are true
our courage will pull us through
you teach me and i ll teach you
pokémon

encourage our faith
i will battle everything
about the place

arm in arm we ll win the fight

a heart so true
our courage will pull us through
you teach me and i ll teach you

we did it 
well  that sure was a shocking ending 
shocking that ash moved so fast 
another credit on pikachu s
 charge account  
we ve got to grab it 
i know we must grab rare
pokémon for the boss   
   but it wouldn t be a bad idea
if we grabbed a bite to eat 
we didn t come here to steal a meal 
i d settle for a taste
of that pika chow 
i m starving 
i can cook something 
the last time you cooked  you
wiped out eight of my nine lives 
master  shall i extend an
invitation to these trainers as well 
as you wish 
watch where you re flying 
something for me 
greetings  pokémon trainers 
i bear an invitation 
she s really small 
but really pretty 
you ve been chosen to join a group of
pokémon trainers at a gathering 
it will be hosted by my master  the
world s greatest pokémon trainer   
   at his palace on new island 
a ferry will leave old shore wharf   
    to take you to the island
this afternoon 
only trainers with this
invitation will be admitted 
if you decide to attend 
you must reply at once 
my master awaits you 
is there a rewind button 
 should we go 
 of course  i ve got to meet her 
i guess the world s number one trainer
wants to challenge me to a match 
 we ve got to let him know right away 
 i m saying yes 
what s so special about
the twerp trio s special delivery 
hey  look 
 yes   to what 
raticate 
chill out  raticate 
ikingler  save your energy 
this is going to be so cool 
officer jenny  report to
the ferry entrance 
officer jenny to
the ferry entrance 
togepi s totally soaked 
i can t believe how
fast the storm came up 
what   the ferry is canceled  
but i ve got to get to new lsland 
 it s only a little rain 
 it s more than just rain 
the harbor manager thinks
this could be the worst storm ever 
listen to me 
the prophets have predicted
the return of the winds of water 
for years   
   i prayed mankind would never
witness that deadly storm ever again 
isn t that just a legend 
ancient writings tell of the storm
wiping out all but a few pokémon 
in their sorrow   
   the water of their tears restored
the lives lost in the storm 
but there are no pokémon tears today 
just waters which no one can survive 
that s why the ferry
has been canceled 
i m going to new lsland anyway 
all my pokémon are water type 
we ll just swim over to that palace 
i warn you  the waves will
be savage  you will never make it 
if you try that stunt and
your pokémon got hurt   
   you d be out of luck because
we closed the pokémon center 
how come 
the nurse in charge of
the center disappeared last month 
if any of you see her 
please contact me at once 
that s a picture of her
over there on the wall 
she s cute 
she sure looks familiar 
come back here  or
i ll place you under arrest 
come back 
some trainers have no fear 
to them  this is just
one more challenge 
they follow their hearts 
that is what sets them apart
and will make them pokémon masters 
good luck to all of you 
the world s greatest pokémon
master is waiting for me 
let s use our pokémon
to get to that island 
our pokémon aren t strong enough 
they can t handle waves like this 
guess you re right 
you vant to cross maybe 
ve take you 
ve vikings are used to big vaves 
ve get you to new lsland faster
than you can say fahrvergnügen 
stroke 
stroke 
stroke  stroke 
i think i m going to have one 
 i didn t know vikings still existed 
 they mostly live in minnesota 
something s not right 
are you sure this boat s safe 
don t vorry  this ship
von t let you down 
ve alvays sail in da
rough veather  don t get upset 
tell my stomach 
heave  heave  heave 
it s all right  togepi 
we re going to be okay 
 those aren t vikings 
 it s team rocket 
i knew there was something fishy
about them besides the smell 
 prepare for trouble 
 make it double 
forget the motto 
we re going to have to    
ash  misty 
 have you seen ash and pikachu 
 not yet 
stay together  it s our only hope 
look 
my master bids you
welcome to new lsland 
ikindly present your invitation 
here it is  miss 
the bearers of this invitation may
be admitted 
i knew i recognized that face 
what 
aren t you the nurse
from the treatment center 
you do look just like her 
i fear you are mistaken 
i ve always dwelt on this island
and been in the service of my master 
please  come this way 
my master awaits your arrival 
with you here  all trainers   
   worthy of an audience with
my master are present 
there s only three of them 
aren t we waiting for the others 
only the trainers capable
of braving the storm   
   are worthy in my master s eyes 
do you mean that storm
was some kind of test 
release your pokémon from
their pokéballs and join the others 
it won t be long before
my master s intentions are clear 
now we ll never know what
kind of party we re missing 
we ll just have to crash that party 
 you know another way in 
 look over there 
but how are we going
to swim up that thing 
pretend you re a catfish 
 something wrong  jessie 
 no  come on  let s get going 
i think this plan s all wet 
psy ya ya duck 
what took you guys so long 
how did you get here 
i decided to fly over 
it was easy 
hurricane winds are
a breeze for pidgeotto here 
guys  say hello 
those are my pokémon 
it was no problem
getting through that storm 
i rode over on gyarados  back 
i heard it takes a lot
of skill to train gyarados 
y es  but once you train it  it s
the most dependable pokémon there is 
you haven t met my
pokémon  over there 
you are about to meet my master 
the time has come to encounter
the greatest pokémon master on earth 
what s that 
yes  the world s greatest
pokémon master   
   is also the most
powerful pokémon on earth 
this is the ruler of new lsland
and soon the whole world 
mewtwo 
mewtwo 
a pokémon can t be
a pokémon master  no way 
quiet  human  from now on 
i am the one who makes the rules 
 how s it talking 
 it s psychic 
we ll show you  let s go  gyarados 
gyarados  hyper beam attack 
gyarados 
child s play 
your usefulness has ended 
nurse joy 
where am l  and how
in the world did i get here 
you have been under my control 
i transported you here
from the pokémon center 
your knowledge of pokémon
physiology proved useful to my plan 
i have cleansed your tiny human
brain of memories from the past weeks 
who are you  
i am the new ruler of this world   
   the master of humans
and pokémon alike 
you re just a bully 
look at these 
they re pokémon 
are they real 
i was hoping there d be a party 
this is the pokémon replication
system  system activated 
pokémon based on genetic analysis 
pokémon dna sampling
sequence now in progress 
put me down 
what are you    let go 
 help 
 grab him 
help me 
i made it  but just by a hair 
look  there s your hair 
analyzing pokémon biomaterial sample 
analysis complete 
pokémon identified 
begin replication sequence 
 who s that pokémon 
 it s meowth 
meowth 
but i m meowth 
 so is the one in the tank 
 your clone 
i haven t got much time 
i pray this record of
our experiment survives 
a year ago we discovered   
   the remains of
the ancient pokémon  mew 
there was sufficient
genetic material to replicate mew 
giovanni insisted on super clones   
   more powerful than
any living pokémon 
finally our experiments
proved successful 
we produced a living pokémon 
we called it mewtwo 
but the creature s anger
is out of control 
with its psychic powers 
it s destroying our laboratory 
we dreamed of creating
the world s strongest pokémon   
   and we succeeded 
 sounds like a real pokénstein 
 sure does 
one bad cat 
so this must be the lab 
but if mewtwo destroyed it    
 somebody rebuilt it 
 y es  but who 
you humans are a dangerous species 
you brought me into your world
with no purpose but to be your slave 
but now i have my own purpose 
my storm will create my own world   
   by destroying yours 
so you hate all humans  and you re
going to destroy us to save pokémon 
no 
your pokémon will not be spared 
they have disgraced
themselves by serving humans 
those pokémon are nothing but slaves 
so  you say i am wrong 
you are not this human s servant 
you are his friend 
you are as pathetic as the rest 
humans and pokémon
can never be friends 
are you okay 
don t pick on pikachu 
if you are pokémon  there s
no reason i can t capture you 
go  rhyhorn 
 no  rhyhorn 
 fools 
your pokémon attacks cannot
weaken me  my powers are too great 
no trainer can conquer me 
you won t mind proving it
in a real match 
is that a challenge 
you bet it is 
they re awake 
blast 
saur 
 i m scared 
 me too 
like most pokémon trainers   
   i too began with charmander 
squirtle and bulbasaur 
but for their evolved forms   
   i used their genetic material
to clone even more powerful copies 
 copies 
 they re clones 
a stadium  mewtwo
planned this all along 
your fake venusaur
can t beat my real one 
right  bruteroot 
we ll blow away that blastoise 
won t we shellshocker  
it may not have a nickname 
but i do have a charizard 
i choose you 
charizard  i didn t say start 
your charizard is poorly trained 
which of you will oppose me first 
saur 
i underestimated you last time 
but that won t happen again 
go  bruteroot  razor leaf 
vine whip 
bruteroot 
it looks like i m up 
go  shellshocker 
blastoise 
blast 
shellshocker  hydro pump 
shellshocker 
you better forfeit  ash 
those clones are too powerful 
i m not giving up 
charizard  use your speed 
not power  and you ll win 
all right  go 
 can t charizard move any quicker 
 the clone is too fast 
 charizard s in trouble 
 finish it 
no  charizard  no 
are you okay 
as the victor  i now claim my prize 
your pokémon 
wait 
what will you do with those pokémon  
i will extract their dna
to make clones for myself 
they will remain safe
on this island   
   while my storm destroys the planet 
you can t do this 
yes  mewtwo  we won t let you 
do not attempt to defy me 
this is my world now 
let s go 
gyarados 
i know 
mewtwo can t catch them
if they re inside their pokéballs 
bulbasaur  squirtle  return 
it s no use 
it s futile to try
and escape my power 
never mind the pokéballs 
carry them away 
give back my psyduck 
vulpix 
run  pikachu 
ikeep running  pikachu 
you re not going to get pikachu 
there goes alakazam 
dewgong 
vileplume 
sandshrew  nidoqueen  vaporeon 
but me  i got a special
place in my tail for this one 
look there 
i don t have time for
your dumb motto today 
who s that pokémon  it s pikachu 
let go  stupid machine 
give me back my pikachu 
what s happening 
i m so glad you re okay 
the copies are hatching 
 they re fabulous fakes 
 send in the clones 
but where are the real ones 
 i wonder if they feel    
 clonesome 
the poké originals 
squirtle s back 
you re all okay 
humans  you have served my purpose 
i am sparing your lives 
for the moment 
but you cannot escape your fate 
the hour of my vengeance draws near 
behold 
with pokémon and humans eliminated   
   the clones shall inherit the world 
you can t do this  i won t let you 
 it s ash 
 all right 
 psyduck 
 vulpix 
it is useless to challenge me 
it s not going to end like this 
mewtwo  we won t let it 
you re mine 
 ash  no 
 look out 
what 
can it be 
 what is that 
 i don t know 
mew  so finally we meet 
i may have been
cloned from your dna   
   but i will prove that mewtwo
is better than the original 
superior to mew 
mew and mewtwo 
so mewtwo was cloned from mew 
this world is too small for two of us 
why do you flee from me 
are you afraid to
find out which of us is greater 
so you do have some fight in you 
but i have no time for games 
destiny is at hand 
who will rule  my super pokémon 
or your pathetic group
of spineless inferior pokémon 
we were created with powers
far stronger than the originals 
 mew s got a good point 
 what s it saying 
you don t prove anything by
showing off a lot of special powers 
and that a pokémon s
real strength comes from the heart 
my clones don t need
their powers to prove their worth 
i will block all the pokémon s
special abilities   
   using my psychic powers 
now we shall see who triumphs  go 
pokémon aren t meant to fight 
not like this 
it s useless 
what can come out of it 
nothing but pain 
can t mewtwo understand it s
not right to force pokémon to battle 
they re all living creatures 
this just proves
that fighting is wrong 
i was prepared for trouble 
but not for this 
make that double for me 
now i can see how
horrible fighting really is 
even the best of friends
will fight sometimes 
i ll promise never to
fight again if you will 
what am i doing 
let s get something straight 
you owth ain t pushing meowth around 
you mean  we don t have
to fight with each other 
but how can i trust you 
you was born different 
i almost made a clawful mistake 
how do i know you re not
going to pull a fast one on me 
you re right  we
do have a lot in common 
the same earth  the
same air  the same sky 
maybe if we started
looking at what s the same   
   instead of always looking at
what s different  who knows 
quit it  please  stop 
are you okay 
we got to stop this 
how  mewtwo wants to prove
how strong those super clones are 
i d rather risk my life
out in mewtwo s storm   
   than watch pokémon
destroy each other 
me too 
i wish there were some way to
stop them  i don t know what to do 
i don t think they ll ever stop 
those pokémon are ready
to fight to the death 
that s a fight that
nobody s going to win 
someone s got to take a stand 
someone s got to say no
and refuse to fight 
just like pikachu 
ash  wait 
you ve got to stop right now 
stop  
oh  no 
fool  trying to stop our battle 
please  no 
the human sacrificed
himself to save the pokémon 
i pitted them against each other 
only when they set aside
their differences   
   did i see the true power
they all share deep inside 
i see now that the circumstances
of one s birth are irrelevant 
it is what you do with
the gift of life   
   that determines who you are 
mewtwo  where are you going 
where my heart can learn
what yours knows so well 
what transpired here 
i will always remember 
but perhaps for you 
these events are best forgotten 
 this could be the worst storm ever 
 you must listen to me 
you have got to find shelter 
excuse me  please 
the pokémon treatment center
will open as a shelter 
anyone who needs a place
to stay should come with me 
nurse joy and officer jenny
are really great 
they keep getting more beautiful
every time i see them 
guys  how did we wind up
in this place anyway 
well  i guess we re
just here because we re here 
yes  let s eat 
look  it s a miracle 
i can t believe it 
 the storm disappeared 
 that s so weird 
it s good to have things clear again 
what s that 
what s what 
 i don t see anything  ash 
 except the sky 
the day i started
my pokémon journey   
   i saw a really rare pokémon 
and just now  i thought
i saw another one 
maybe you re just seeing things  ash 
maybe he s not 
maybe we ll see 
many strange legends
surround the mysteries of pokémon 
just as many adventures
await our heroes   
   as they continue on their quest 
for ash and his friends 
the journey s just begun 
i don  t know how we
got here  but who cares 
 this is paradise
