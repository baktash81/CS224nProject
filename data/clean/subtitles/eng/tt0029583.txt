i summon thee
speak
let me see thy face
what wouldst thou know my queen
magic mirror on the wall
who is the fairest one of all
famed is thy beauty majesty
but hold a lovely maid i see
rags cannot hide her gentle grace
alas she is more fair than thee
alas for her reveal her name
lips red as the rose
hair black as ebony
skin white as snow
snow white
want to know a secret
promise not to tell
we are standing
by a wishing well
make a wish into the well
thats all you have to do
and if you hear it echoing
your wish will soon come true
im wishing
im wishing
for the one i love
to find me
to find me
today
today
im hoping
im hoping
and im dreaming of
the nice things
the nice things

im wishing
for the one i love
to find me

now that ive found you
hear what i have to say
one song
i have but one song
one song only for you
one heart tenderly beating
ever entreating
constant and true
one love
that has possessed me
one love
thrilling me through
one song
my heart keeps singing
of one love
only for you
take her far into the forest
find some secluded glade
where she can pick wildflowers
yes your majesty
and there my faithful huntsman
you will kill her
but your majesty the little princess
silence
you know the penalty if you fail
yes your majesty
but to make doubly sure
you do not fail
bring back her heart in this
one song
i have but one song
hello there
whats the matter
wheres your mama and papa
why i believe youre lost
oh please dont cry
come on perk up
wont you smile for me
thats better
your mama and papa cant be far
there they are
can you fly
goodbye goodbye

forgive me
i beg of your highness forgive me
i dont understand
shes mad jealous of you
shell stop at nothing
but but who

run away hide
in the woods anywhere
never come back
now go go go
run run hide
oh
please dont run away
i wont hurt you
im awfully sorry
i didnt mean to frighten you
but you dont know
what ive been through
and all because i was afraid
im so ashamed of the fuss ive made
what do you do
when things go wrong
oh you sing a song
with a smile and a song
life is just like a bright sunny day
your cares fade away
and your heart is young
with a smile and a song
all the world seems to waken anew
rejoicing with you
as the song is sung
theres no use in grumbling
when raindrops come tumbling
remember youre the one
who can fill the world with sunshine
when you smile and you sing
everything is in tune and its spring
and life flows along
with a smile and a song
i really feel quite happy now
im sure ill get along somehow
everythings going to be all right
but i do need a place to sleep at night
i cant sleep
in the ground like you
or in a tree the way you do
and im sure no nest would possibly
be big enough for me
maybe you know where i can stay
in the woods somewhere
you do
will you take me there
oh its adorable
just like a dolls house
i like it here
ooh its dark inside
guess theres no one home
hello
may i come in
shh
oh
what a cute little chair
why theres seven little chairs
must be seven little children
and from the look of this table
seven untidy little children
a pickaxe a stocking too
and a shoe
and just look at that fireplace
its covered with dust
and look cobwebs everywhere
my my my
what a pile of dirty dishes
and just look at that broom
why theyve never swept this room
youd think their mother would
maybe they have no mother
then theyre orphans
thats too bad
i know
well clean the house
and surprise them
then maybe theyll let me stay
now you wash the dishes
you tidy up the room
you clean the fireplace
and i will use the broom
just whistle while you work
and cheerfully together
we can tidy up the place
so hum a merry tune
it wont take long when theres a song
to help you set the pace
and as you sweep the room
imagine that the broom
is someone that you love and soon
youll find youre dancing to the tune
oh no no no no put them in the tub
when hearts are high the time will fly
so whistle while you work
uhuh uhuh
not under the rug
so whistle while you work
we dig dig dig
dig dig dig dig
in our mine the whole day through
to dig dig dig dig dig dig dig
is what we like to do
it aint no trick to get rich quick
if ya dig dig dig
with a shovel or a pick
in a mine
in a mine
where a million diamonds
shine
we dig dig dig dig dig dig dig
from early morn til night
we dig dig dig dig dig dig dig
up everything in sight
we dig up diamonds by the score
a thousand rubies
sometimes more
though we dont know
what we dig em for
we dig dig digadig dig

in a disguise so complete
no one will ever suspect
now a formula to transform
my beauty into ugliness
change my queenly raiment
to a peddlers cloak
mummy dust to make me old
to shroud my clothes
the black of night
to age my voice an old hags cackle
to whiten my hair a scream of fright
a blast of wind
to fan my hate
a thunderbolt
to mix it well
now
begin thy magic spell
look
my hands
my voice
my voice
a perfect disguise
and now
a special sort of death
for one so fair
