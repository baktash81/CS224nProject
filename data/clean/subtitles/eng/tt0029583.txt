i summon thee 
speak 
let me see thy face 
what wouldst thou know  my queen 
magic mirror on the wall 
who is the fairest one of all 
famed is thy beauty  majesty 
but hold  a lovely maid i see 
rags cannot hide her gentle grace 
alas  she is more fair than thee 
alas for her  reveal her name 
lips red as the rose 
hair black as ebony 
skin white as snow 
snow white 
want to know a secret 
promise not to tell 
we are standing
by a wishing well
make a wish into the well
that s all you have to do
and if you hear it echoing
your wish will soon come true
  i m wishing
  i m wishing
for the one i love
  to find me
  to find me
  today
  today
  i m hoping
  i m hoping
and i m dreaming of
  the nice things
  the nice things
  he ll say
  he ll say
  i m wishing
  i m wishing
for the one i love
  to find me
  to find me
  today
  today
  oh 
  hello 
  oh 
  did i frighten you 
wait  wait  please 
don t run away 
now that i ve found you
hear what i have to say
one song
i have but one song
one song only for you
one heart tenderly beating
ever entreating
constant and true
one love
that has possessed me
one love
thrilling me through
one song
my heart keeps singing
of one love
only for you
take her far into the forest 
find some secluded glade
where she can pick wildflowers 
yes  your majesty 
and there  my faithful huntsman 
you will kill her 
but  your majesty  the little princess 
silence 
you know the penalty if you fail 
yes  your majesty 
but to make doubly sure
you do not fail 
bring back her heart in this 
one song 
i have but one song
hello there 
what s the matter 
where s your mama and papa 
why  i believe you re lost 
oh  please don t cry 
come on  perk up 
won t you smile for me 
that s better 
your mama and papa can t be far 
there they are 
can you fly 
good bye  good bye 
i can t  i can t do it 
forgive me 
i beg of your highness  forgive me 
i don t understand 
she s mad  jealous of you 
she ll stop at nothing 
  but  but who 
  the queen 
  the queen 
  now  quick  child  run 
run away  hide 
in the woods  anywhere 
never come back 
now  go  go  go 
run  run  hide 
oh 
please don t run away 
i won t hurt you 
i m awfully sorry 
i didn t mean to frighten you 
but you don t know
what i ve been through 
and all because i was afraid 
i m so ashamed of the fuss i ve made 
what do you do
when things go wrong 
oh  you sing a song 
with a smile and a song
life is just like a bright  sunny day
your cares fade away
and your heart is young
with a smile and a song
all the world seems to waken anew
rejoicing with you
as the song is sung
there s no use in grumbling
when raindrops come tumbling
remember you re the one
who can fill the world with sunshine
when you smile and you sing
everything is in tune and it s spring
and life flows along
with a smile and a song
i really feel quite happy now 
i m sure i ll get along somehow 
everything s going to be all right 
but i do need a place to sleep at night 
i can t sleep
in the ground like you
or in a tree the way you do 
and i m sure no nest would possibly
be big enough for me 
maybe you know where i can stay 
in the woods somewhere 
you do 
will you take me there 
oh  it s adorable 
just like a doll s house 
i like it here 
ooh  it s dark inside 
guess there s no one home 
hello 
may i come in 
shh 
oh 
what a cute little chair 
why  there s seven little chairs 
must be seven little children 
and from the look of this table 
seven untidy little children 
a pickaxe  a stocking  too 
and a shoe 
and just look at that fireplace 
it s covered with dust 
and look  cobwebs everywhere 
my  my  my 
what a pile of dirty dishes 
and just look at that broom 
why  they ve never swept this room 
you d think their mother would   
maybe they have no mother 
then they re orphans 
that s too bad 
i know 
we ll clean the house
and surprise them 
then maybe they ll let me stay 
now  you wash the dishes 
you tidy up the room 
you clean the fireplace 
and i will use the broom 
just whistle while you work
and cheerfully together
we can tidy up the place
so hum a merry tune
it won t take long when there s a song
to help you set the pace
and as you sweep the room
imagine that the broom
is someone that you love and soon
you ll find you re dancing to the tune
oh  no  no  no  no  put them in the tub 
when hearts are high the time will fly
so whistle while you work
uh uh  uh uh 
not under the rug 
so whistle while you work
we dig  dig  dig 
dig  dig  dig  dig
in our mine the whole day through
to dig  dig  dig  dig  dig  dig  dig
is what we like to do
it ain t no trick to get rich quick
if ya dig  dig  dig

  in a mine
  in a mine
where a million diamonds

from early morn  til night

my beauty into ugliness 
change my queenly raiment
to a peddler s cloak 
mummy dust to make me old 
to shroud my clothes 
the black of night 
to age my voice  an old hag s cackle 
to whiten my hair  a scream of fright 
a blast of wind
to fan my hate 
a thunderbolt
to mix it well
