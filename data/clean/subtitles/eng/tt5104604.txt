its dominion
the catloving
kobayashi dynasty declared war
and descended in force
upon the unwary
fourlegged beasts
on the eve
of total canine annihilation
a child warrior
sympathetic to the plight
of the besieged underdog dogs
betrayed his species
beheaded the head of the head
of the kobayashi clan
and pledged his sword
with the following

i turn my back
on mankind
frost on windowpane
he would later be known
as the boy samurai

their conquered foe

20 years in the future
canine saturation
has reached
epidemic proportions
an outbreak of snoutfever
rips through

the expulsion and containment
of all breeds
both stray and domesticated
by official decree
trash island
becomes an exile colony
banish all dogs
save megasaki city of uni prefecture
the isle of dogs
respecto
its not fair to the dogs
the path favored
by mayor kobayashi
is cruel and unscientific
for a thousand years
these resilient animals
have loved
served and protected us
now in their time
of greatest need
we forsake them again
a tidalwave
of antidog hysteria
has crippled
our moral judgment
give me six months
and i will deliver a serum
im this close dammit
dogflu will be eradicated
snoutfever will be defeated
canine saturation
will be returned
to sustainable levels
and without massneutering
whatever happened
to mans best friend
no no no
the crowd is calling
for the immediate ratification
and approval
of the mayors proposal
as a
gesture of public solidarity
mayor kobayashi
is calling upon
his assistant hatchetman
majordomo
to furnish
the personal bodyguarddog

in response to questions
regarding the purported
disappearance
of his ward atari
mayor kobayashi offers
no comment
and urges reporters to respect
the privacy of
the mayoralhousehold
atari aged 12 was last seen
early yesterday morning
rolling a small airplane
onto a runway
at megasaki executive airport
24 hours later
i bite
i beg your pardon
ignore that dog
hes got snoutfever
just please follow us
now i never met him
but i asked around
i understand
he made a lot of friends
he had a very goodnatured
temperament im told
of course
you would know best
its just a bit further
up here on the left
anyway as i say
he seemed to have been
an extremely pleasant animal
unfortunately nobody could
figure out
how to open his dogcage
three years earlier
the sole survivor
of last weeks
colossal
bullettrain disaster
a young boy named atari
awoke from a deepcoma
early this morning
to learn
of his parents tragic deaths
and also the intention
of his distantuncle
mayor kobayashi
to personally adopt him
as ward
to the mayoralhousehold
upon his release
from megasaki general
atari who suffered the loss
of his right kidney
and numerous broken bones
in the crash
will live
in sequestered quarters
within the confines
of brick mansion
where he will be educated
in solitude by private tutors
atari has also been assigned
a securitydetail
for his own protection
in the form of a highly
trained bodyguarddog
named spots kobayashi
um youre my new master
my name is spots
im at your service
ill be protecting
your welfare and safety
on an ongoingbasis
in other words im your dog
bodyguarddog not pet

the robotdog
wait what
king duke boss you attack
the three dogcatchers
on it
ill guard the little pilot
on my command ready
wait a second
i am not gonna fight
this robot
im against the little pilot
remember
i dont even believe
in masters
youre the best in a scrap
we all know that
you like to fight
well lets take a vote
all in favor of chief
fighting the robotdog
say aye
aye
nay
sic em
my ward atari
has been kidnapped
against his will
by a pack of disobedient
contagious infected animals
he will be rescued promptly
returned to safety
and grounded for the duration
of his childhood years
his five dogabductors
have been identified
through the use
of advanced toothandtail
recognition software
they will of course
be captured
and violently destroyed
chief ought to
get a checkup too
he looks worse than anybody
i wish somebody
spoke his language
sito
well i understood that
sit down
sito
chief sit
i dont sit
youre disobedient sit
no
i wouldnt drink that
if i were you
its full of toxic chemicals
how do you know
because my sisterinlaw
drank it
and her tongue turned black
oh
youre felixs mate
i beg your pardon
i mean i think you mated
with felix
if i heard it right
thats none of your business
no no i dont suggest
whether it actually
happened or not
im just saying
that i recognize you
from when i heard that rumor
i think im going
to say goodnight
wait wait wait no
wait start over
who cares about felix
im chief
thats my name
i see
im introducing myself
who are you
i thought you knew
all about me
no i dont know anything
i shouldve kept
my mouth shut
its all hearsay
anyway youre nutmeg
so you do know me after all
after all yes
you a showdog nutmeg
i was bred as a showdog
i was groomed
for that purpose
it wasnt my choice
i dont consider it
my identity
anyway look around
what difference
does it make now
so thats a yes
so thats a
yes i used to be
may i join you
youve been attacked
hmm what else is new
you should see the other dog
actually
i think he was made
of stainlesssteel
i couldnt get my teeth
into him
who is the little pilot
whatd he do
why are they after him
nobody knows
youre a stray arent you
yes im a stray
but arent we all
in the last analysis i mean
were you trained
for competition
i was a showdog
you know a few tricks then
a few
can i see one
maybe if i get to
know you better
fair enough
its not true by the way
about me and felix
for the record
i wouldnt bring puppies
into this world
i dont believe in masters
i never did
its against my principles
but this is no place
for a dog like you
you belong somewhere
youve got papers
oh im fullgrown
sweetheart
you dont have to worry
about me
goodnight
i hope ill see you again
heres one
one what
im supposed to be spinning
a ninepound bowlingball
over my head at this point
but you just have to
imagine that part
oh
i can picture it
will you help him
the little pilot
why should i
because hes
a 12yearold boy
dogs love those
spots whoever he is
might be alive
and he might be dead
but one things for sure
hes nowhere around here
hes not in the dogcommunity
theres probably another
500 japanese hectares
of unmapped wasteland
on trash island at least
where do we start
also
the mental health question
maybe its because of that
propellerclutch stuck
in the side of his head
i cant say im not a doctor
but i think the little pilots
got a screw loose
those are the cons
you heard the rumor right
about the little pilot
which rumor
what is that
kobayashi is
his distant uncle
hes the mayors ward
what
whoa
be that as it may
lets look at the pros
that boy flew here all alone
and crashlanded
onto this island
for one reason
one reason only
to find his dog
to the best of my knowledge
no other master
not one single human master
has made any effort
to do that
theyve forgotten
all about us
i propose we start tomorrow
firstlight
well cross
the middle fingers
well find the tugboat
on the dune
well go see jupiter
and oracle
theyll know what to do
lets take a vote
all in favor say aye
aye
nay
whos the naysayer
him
me
that kid is gonna get us all
put to sleep euthanized
we wont find the dog
but we will die trying
not a bad way to go
youre outvoted anyway
scienceparty candidate
professor watanabe

at toho mountain ryokan
after offering sharp criticism
last night
of the
kobayashi administrations
canine saturationcrisis
policy
foreignexchange
student walker
thank you editorhiroshi
you all know me
i speak my mind
and sometimes
that ruffles some feathers
please forgive my bluntness
mayor kobayashi is a crook
and i hate him
right now
he faces a divided congress
during a hotlycontested
reelection year
dogs are dying
on a miserable island
gullible masters
have been brainwashed
the scienceparty candidate
is being held against his will
with no recourse
to legal counsel
somebody is up to something
you have
a conspiracy theory
i have a hunch
i dont print hunch
huh
ill spell it out
i believe
municipal dome propaganda
has deliberately stoked
irrational antidog fear
and suppressed a medically
proven dogflu treatment
in order to promote
a secret campaign
to turn the country against
its innocent housepets
there i said it
can you prove it
i dont know
to tell you the truth
i dont know
part two
the search for spots
the middle fingers
of trash island
wind and weave upriver
interstitched
by zigzagging pipelines
and rusty viaducts
the ruins of
a failed utilitycomplex
washedout by tsunami
the rubble of an abandoned
powerplant
demolished by earthquake
the remains of a deserted
industrial estate
destroyed by volcanic blast
the old trash island
athletic club
memberless
and longforgotten
okay i got a question
whats your favorite food
a doubleportion
of doggychop from the can
mixed into a bowl
of broken puppysnaps
with a vitamin
crushed up into it
kings the spokesdog
for that
hes the doggychop dog
mmm used to be
was that
your daily meal
not always my master
was a schoolteacher
we werent rich
you know you
a centercut kobe
ribeye seared
on the bone
with salt and pepper
wow
it was my birthday
supper every year
mines hotsausage
yakitoristyle
the snack vendor always
saved me one on gamedays
hmm duke
ah greentea ice cream
my master had a sweettooth
i probably inherited it
from her
you heard the rumor right
about doggychop
remind us again
what rumor
oh they folded
oh no
doggy doggychop folded
how about you chief
what was your favorite food
me oh i dont care
garbage trash
scraps of rubbish
im used to leftovers
hmm
yeah yeah
of course
i wasnt always a stray
wait whatd you say
i said i wasnt always
a stray
really since when
tell us about that
ive been hunted by
dogcatchers all my life
im not easy to trap
ive only got three captures
on my record
where i actually got sent
to the pound i mean
and the first two times
i escaped within 24 hours
but the third time
i got adopted before i could
finish digging
the breakouttunnel
it was a big family
five kids
two other dogs already
they stuck me
in the back of a stationwagon
and drove me out
to the middle of the sticks
grass trees swimming pool
cartoons on tv
anyway one morning
a week later
the youngest boy
his name was toshiro
woke me up at 615
brighteyed wideawake
and he tried to pet me
he didnt mean anything by it
he was just being friendly
apparently i bit him so hard
i nearly chewed his hand off
blood all over
the kitchen floor
they rushed him
to the emergency room
and i got padlocked out
in the toolshed
with the lights out
it gave me some time to think
what happened
why did i do that
to this day i have no idea
i guess he scared me
i bite
that night an old woman
she mustve been
the grandmother
brought me out a bowl of some
homemade hibachichili
i like to think she cooked it
for me
personally but who knows
maybe it was just
more leftovers but
youve got a tick
anyway thats my favorite
food i ever ate
the old woman made
a great bowl of chili
what happened after that
i dug my way out by morning
jumped on the back
of a dumptruck
and hitched back to megasaki
i was always a streetdog
lets face it
somebodys stalking us
as you know we all hate dogs
chairman fujimotosan
president of
kobayashi pharmaceutical
you secretly introduced
megaquantities
of infected fleas
and contagious ticklarvae
into a metropolitan
city center
creating an unprecedented
animaldisease outbreak
thank you
general yamatachisan
commander of the megasaki
municipal task force
you oversaw the deportation
of over 750000 cagedanimals
to a nearly uninhabitable
offshore refusecenter
good work
supervisor kitanosan
director
of kobayashi robotics
you developed the most
promising artificial lifeform
in the history
of corporatetechnology
and a powerful new weapon
to boot
well done
yakuza nakamurasan
head of
the clenchedfist gang
you eliminated
all prodog opposition
through the use of bribery
extortion intimidation
and violent force
my compliments
brains have been washed
wheels have been greased
fear has been mongered
now we prepare
for the final stage
of our conspiracytheory
the permanent end
to the canine
saturationcrisis
we believe weve
recovered a viable dna sample
from this article
of damaged aviation equipment
were going to check it
right now
if you care to observe
we call upon
doglovers everywhere

to my securitydetail
bodyguarddog
spots kobayashi
if still living
i leave
all my worldly possessions
if spots has preceded me
into the next life
i ask that everything
including my own bones
and spots carcass
be burned
in a crematory furnace
with our ashes scattered
to the fourwinds
it will not amount to much
pollution in this sad land
if i survive
ignore this message
ive gone to find my dog

and warms the dogbones

she understands tv
you seek a dog named spots
dogzero
dogzero
as you know most of
the animals on this island
come from human homes
with domesticated
backgrounds
however a small population
of savage aboriginal dogs
have been scavenging
the metropolitan
dumpinggrounds
for nearly a decade
the graffiti on this wall
depicts the story
they were born into captivity
on the ends of the fringes
of the most distant reaches
of the island
they endured
great suffering and cruelty
at the hands
of their former masters
finally in the wake of
an act of god they escaped
to a harsh
and desperate freedom
some say they died away
over the subsequent years
starving and forgotten
some say they swam
to the mainland
but this seems unlikely
too far to dogpaddle
some say
theyre still with us
in the faraway cuticles
beyond the middle fingers
we know the animal you seek
he has appeared
in oracles visions
a prophecy suggests itself
spots if hes alive
may very well be living
even at this moment
as a captive prisoner
abducted into the company
of these wild savage dogs
oracle what do you think
what
continue your journey
have faith in your cause
luck and good fortune
be unto you
you heard the rumor right
about these aboriginal dogs
remind me again
whats the rumor

going to want to eat us
well theyre cannibals

mayor kobayashi
elected leader
of megasaki city
for 150 years
you and your ancestors
known as
the kobayashi dynasty
a procession of
doghating thugs
stooges felons
and their criminal underlings
have betrayed and deceived
the citizens
of uni prefecture
you make me so mad
professor watanabe
scienceparty candidate
deceased
the wasabi in your blood
showed poisonlevels
in excess of ten times
the maximum dosage required
to stop the heart of a whale
whyd you do it
atari kobayashi adopted ward
to the mayoralhousehold
you heroically hijacked
a junior turboprop xj750
and flew it to the island
atari
you heroically
as i was saying
stole the little airplane
because of your dog and
i lost my train of thought
dammit
ive got a crush on you
part three
the rendezvous
rex king duke boss
you made it
what happened to you
i took a bath
what hes got soap
just a little
youre too fluffy
we played fetch
with a stick
with a hunk
of rubber radiatortubing
and you brought it back
to him
yeah
hes a good boy
dont you tell me that
im the one
that tried to make you
be loyal to him
in the first place
stop stop
this is the rendezvous
wheres that trashtram
taking you
you think we booked this ride
through a travel agent
we were fighting for our lives
in a highvelocity
trashprocessor
while you were getting
scrubbed and brushed
jump
where
here
when
now
why
what
lets take a vote
all in favor of jump
whos that
i cant smell him
come in
master atari
can you hear me
huh
that dogs real
whats that thing
in your ear for
are you hard of hearing
you cant be um
bodyguarddogs have to have
2030auditory
just to be certified
no the earpiece
is how i receive
my commands and instructions
and so on
obviously im privy to
certain sensitive information
due to my position
in the mayoralhousehold
at brick mansion
oh so you mean
somebody could be talking
to you right now
well the range is only about
75 feet or so i guess so
batterys probably dead
anyway
i got a question for you
how much money
do you think the mayor makes
i cant tell you that
thats highly confidential
um anyway im not
the mayors accountants dog
thats butterscotch
and she got crushed
in a glass compactor
the day before yesterday
no my duties
are uh focused entirely
on the protection
of the mayors ward atari
im not supposed
to be his friend
but i love him very much
but thats a private matter
um the only reason
i even said that
was because were all probably
going to die out here
and ill never see him again
thats a tough break
well good luck to you
and watch out
for the cannibaldogs
hmm
hmm
what
what
watch out for the
the cannibaldogs
they are dogs that eat dogs
start over and repeat again
you know what
dont even worry about that
i just heard there might be
some wild aboriginal
cannibaldogs
in the area you know
but i wouldnt worry
because youre
in an extrasecurity
lock cell
look at it that way
youre probably safer
than i am
except from thirst
and starvation
its got an extrasecurity
lock on it
youll never get it open
are you going to eat me now
what did you say
are you going to eat me now
i heard
you were cannibaldogs
be notified ill be compelled
to defend myself
with all means at my disposal
hmm
who told you that dirty lie
we resorted to cannibalism
on one occasion
many months ago
as a desperate
survival instinct
we ate one single dog
his name was fuzzball
and he was the leader
of our pack
and he was already in a coma
from starvation
so we put him out of his
his
his misery and
and
consumed him
we would have dropped dead
in a week or less
without that nourishment
we were dying
do you judge us for that
shame on you
we only brought you here
in the first place
to help you
weve got a master passkey
open his cage
fuzzball was his best friend
oh dear
uh i think i offended him
im truly sorry
i had no idea
what is this place
how long have you been here
i can see
youve been mistreated
are you okay
my name is spots
spots kobayashi
how can i be of service
to you
master atarisan
can you hear me
can you hear me master atari
spotsu
youre not safe here
you shouldnt have
come for me
i cant
protect you efficiently
under these conditions
spotsu
here i come
sicem
follow me
all in favor of kicking
chief out of the pack
and never speaking
to him again say aye
aye
how did you do that
secret tooth military issue
technically i could do it
37 more times
but i wouldnt be able
to chew my meat
i assume youre spots
weve been looking for you
master atarisan
i swore an oath when i assumed
the responsibilities
of official bodyguarddog
to the mayoralhousehold
i could never be persuaded
to break that vow
for any reason whatsoever
ill always be loyal to you
as my only
and unconditional master
but circumstances
have radically changed for me
and all the pets
of megasaki city
i have new obligations
which i never anticipated
ive become the leader
of a tribe of outcasts
who depend on me
for their survival
and im going to be a father
with deepest sadness
and humility
i must ask you to relieve me
of the duties of my position
effective immediately
you son of a bitch
if we dont drown im going
to strangle you myself
i dont care
how many exploding teeth
you try to spitout at me
do you have any idea
what that little pilot
just went through
to try to rescue you
how dare you
youre a stray
yeah so what
whats your name
who cares
youre from central megasaki
i can tell by the accent
youre a shorthairedoceanic
speckleearsporthoundmix

of all baddogs

before the volcano erupted
and an earthquake
triggered the tsunami
which obliterated
the facility

incarcerated animals
here on the premises
being experimented on
against their will
if you look closely you may
notice some of these dogs
still bear scars and markings
from the research and abuse

atari was a hero
professor watanabe

and incite anarchy

mayor kobayashi
has directed majordomo
to bring him the red button
nutmeg
holy smokes
my lungs feel clear
my equilibrium feels balanced
my vision is sharp as a tack
for the first time in months
wow thats a great serum
master atari whose death
i think we can say
appears to have been
inaccurately reported
has asked to read a statement
to the general assembly
he will then withdraw
from the debate
and respond
to no further questions
dear editorhiroshi
of the megasaki senior high
dailymanifesto
in a series
of firstrate articles
by an attractive cubreporter
on your staff
you shine a spotlight
on the great injustice
that has occurred
under the kobayashi
administration
i have spent much of my time
in recent weeks
traveling in the company
of the very kind of animals
our mayor refers to
as baddogs
they are the finest
livingbeings
i have ever come to know
in all my dozen years
on this earth
to your readers
the good people of megasaki
i say the cycle of life
always hangs
in a delicate balance
who are we
and who do we want to be
who are we
i wrote a haiku
to try to express my feelings
about the suffering dogs
of trash island
it is also about nature love
friendship eternity
and a black owl
i call it ataris lantern
he said a haiku
ill tell you later
i dedicate this poem
to my distantuncle
mayor kobayashi
who took me in
when i myself was a straydog
with nowhere else to turn
editorhiroshi
please extend my subscription
for an additional year
i enclose a check in the
amount of one thousand yen
signed atari kobayashi
former ward
to the mayoralhousehold
hmm
notfairtotheboy
notfairtothedog
he says ihavenohonor
hmm
holy moses
the mayor
has just officially
unstamped
the trash island decree
no kidding
majordomo
is accusing the mayor
of breaking
his campaign promise
hes steaming mad
its gonna be a fight
spit him with a tooth
i cant get a clean shot
too many innocent protesters
ill be right back
escape
escape escape
escape
well the brain surgery
was a complete success
but his left kidney failed
due to the stress
of the operation
but what about
the right one
he lost it in a traincrash
three years ago
take my left kidney
give it to atarikun
according
to a longstanding statute
unique to uni prefecture
in the event of the death
disappearance
or felonyprosecution
of the chosen candidate
on while during
or concurrent
with the reelectionnight
ceremony
all powers and authorities
vested in his or her
designated office
transfer forthwith
to his or her
nextofkin andor
appointed heir
in other words
atari kobayashi is the new
mayor of megasaki city
you heard me right
atari kobayashi
is the new mayor
of megasaki city
lets hope
that new kidney works
boy what a night
life in uni prefecture
returned to a comfortable
tranquility
the megasaki dragons
ended their winning streak
with a staggering loss
to the honda goblins
doggychop reopened
all 11
of its domestic factories
and puppysnaps
resumed production
with an improved product
graft and political corruption
were reduced to sustainable
acceptable levels
the dogflu serum
cured every breathinganimal
in the region
some say
a few lostdogs
continue to roam and scavenge
on trash island
however these
rumors remain unconfirmed
mayor atari
we all agree
it should be a crime
to abuse beat murder
or yell at any dog
in megasaki city
that is not the question
the question is
what is the appropriate
punishment
exactly and the answer is
death penalty
that seems excessive to us
possibly anyway
we should make it
at least 30 days
communityservice
and a fine
of no less than 250000 yen
meeting adjourned
im standingby master atari
so how does it feel
to be a former stray
hmm i take it
one day at a time
last week i nearly behanded
an industrial lobbyist
from west suzuki
they had to give him
a blood transfusion
he probably had it coming
maybe learned any new tricks
actually yes just one
can i see it
im supposed to be juggling
ten bowlingpins
engulfed in flames
over my tail at this point
but you just have to imagine
that part
i can picture it
you still against bringing
puppies into this world
ill tell you
when i get to know you better
fair enough
my friends think
i like to fight
but its just not true
sometimes i lose my temper
and blow off a little steam
but ive never enjoyed it
