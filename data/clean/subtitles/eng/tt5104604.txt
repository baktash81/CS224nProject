it s not fair to the dogs 
the path favored

these resilient animals
have loved

now  in their time
of greatest need 
we forsake them again 
a tidal wave
of anti dog hysteria
has crippled
our moral judgment 
give me six months 
and i will deliver a serum 
i m this close  dammit 
dog flu will be eradicated 
snout fever will be defeated 
canine saturation
will be returned

like a pack of maniacs 
let s just open the sack first
and see what s actually in it 
it might not even
be worth the trouble 
what do you say 
i m not sure 
maybe 
alright 
a rancid apple core 
two worm eaten banana peels 
a moldy rice cake 
a dried up pickle 
tin of sardine bones 
a pile of broken egg shells 
an old  smushed up 
rotten gizzard

we all are  let s take a vote 
all in favor of not eating
the little pilot  say  aye  
  aye

first things first 
let s open his helmet

some air if he s alive 
then see if we can pull that
hunk of
broken propeller clutch

  yeah  that s right 
mmm hmm

wow 
in response to questions
regarding the purported
disappearance
of his ward atari 
mayor kobayashi offers
no comment
and urges reporters to respect
the privacy of
the mayoral household 
atari  aged 12  was last seen
early yesterday morning
rolling a small airplane
onto a runway
at megasaki executive airport 
24 hours later 
i bite 
i beg your pardon 
ignore that dog 
he s got snout fever 
just please follow us 
now  i never met him 
but i asked around 
i understand
he made a lot of friends 
he had a very good natured
temperament  i m told 
of course 
you would know best 
it s just a bit further
up here on the left 
anyway  as i say 
he seemed to have been
an extremely pleasant animal 
unfortunately  nobody could
figure out
how to open his dog cage 
three years earlier 
the sole survivor
of last week s
colossal
bullet train disaster 
a young boy named atari 
awoke from a deep coma
early this morning
to learn
of his parents  tragic deaths
and also the intention
of his distant uncle 
mayor kobayashi 
to personally adopt him
as ward
to the mayoral household 
upon his release
from megasaki general 
atari who suffered the loss
of his right kidney
and numerous broken bones
in the crash
will live
in sequestered quarters
within the confines
of brick mansion 
where he will be educated
in solitude by private tutors 
atari has also been assigned
a security detail
for his own protection
in the form of a highly
trained bodyguard dog
named spots kobayashi 
um  you re my new master 
my name is spots 
i m at your service 
i ll be protecting
your welfare and safety
on an ongoing basis 
in other words  i m your dog 
bodyguard dog  not pet 
i can hear you 
master atari 
i can hear you 
i can hear you 
i can hear you 
oh  no 
you need a key 
where d you get that 
what  i always had this 
i stole it
off the dead skeleton 
oh  no 
hey  the wrong dog died 
the wrong dog died 
the wrong   
the wrong dog died 
he s not spots 
who is that 
i can t smell him 
this is child abuse 
chief  you fight
the robot dog 
wait  what 
king  duke  boss  you attack
the three dog catchers 
on it 
i ll guard the little pilot 
on my command  ready 
wait a second 
i am not gonna fight
this robot 
i m against the little pilot 
remember 
i don t even believe
in masters 
you re the best in a scrap 
we all know that 
you like to fight 
well  let s take a vote 
all in favor of chief
fighting the robot dog 
say  aye  
  aye 
  nay 
sic  em 
my ward  atari 
has been kidnapped
against his will
by a pack of disobedient 
contagious  infected animals 
he will be rescued promptly 
returned to safety 
and grounded for the duration
of his childhood years 
his five dog abductors
have been identified
through the use
of advanced tooth and tail
recognition software 
they will  of course 
be captured
and violently destroyed 
chief ought to
get a check up  too 
he looks worse than anybody 
i wish somebody
spoke his language 
sit o 
well  i understood that 
sit down 
sit o 
chief  sit 
i don t sit 
you re disobedient  sit 
no 
i wouldn t drink that 
if i were you 
it s full of toxic chemicals 
how do you know 
because my sister in law
drank it 
and her tongue turned black 
oh 
you re felix s mate 
i beg your pardon 
i mean  i think you mated
with felix 
if i heard it right 
that s none of your business 
no  no  i don t suggest
whether it actually
happened or not 
i m just saying
that i recognize you
from when i heard that rumor 
i think i m going
to say good night 
wait  wait  wait  no 
wait  start over 
who cares about felix 
i m chief 
that s my name 
i see 
i m introducing myself 
who are you 
i thought you knew
all about me 
no  i don t know anything 
i should ve kept
my mouth shut 
it s all hearsay 
anyway  you re nutmeg 
so you do know me  after all 
after all  yes 
you a show dog  nutmeg 
i was bred as a show dog 
i was groomed
for that purpose 
it wasn t my choice 
i don t consider it
my identity 
anyway  look around 
what difference
does it make now 
so that s a yes 
so that s a 
yes  i used to be 
may i join you 
you ve been attacked 
hmm  what else is new 
you should see the other dog 
actually 
i think he was made
of stainless steel 
i couldn t get my teeth
into him 
who is the little pilot 
what d he do 
why are they after him 
nobody knows 
you re a stray  aren t you 
yes  i m a stray 
but aren t we all 
in the last analysis  i mean 
were you trained 
for competition 
i was a show dog 
you know a few tricks  then 
a few 
can i see one 
maybe if i get to
know you better 
fair enough 
it s not true  by the way 
about me and felix 
for the record 
i wouldn t bring puppies
into this world 
i don t believe in masters 
i never did 
it s against my principles 
but this is no place
for a dog like you 
you belong somewhere 
you ve got papers 
oh  i m full grown 
sweetheart 
you don t have to worry
about me 
good night 
i hope i ll see you again 
  here s one 
  one what 
i m supposed to be spinning
a nine pound bowling ball
over my head at this point 
but you just have to
imagine that part 
oh 
i can picture it 
will you help him 
the little pilot 
why should i 
because he s
a 12 year old boy 
dogs love those 
spots  whoever he is 
might be alive 
and he might be dead 
but one thing s for sure 
he s nowhere around here 
he s not in the dog community 
there s probably another
500 japanese hectares
of unmapped waste land
on trash island at least 
where do we start 
also 
the mental health question 
maybe it s because of that
propeller clutch stuck
in the side of his head
i can t say  i m not a doctor 
but i think the little pilot s
got a screw loose 
those are the cons 
you heard the rumor  right 
about the little pilot 
which rumor 
what is that 
kobayashi is
his distant uncle 
he s the mayor s ward 
  what 
  whoa 
be that as it may 
let s look at the pros 
that boy flew here  all alone 
and crash landed
onto this island
for one reason 
one reason only 
to find his dog 
to the best of my knowledge 
no other master 
not one single human master 
has made any effort
to do that 
they ve forgotten
all about us 
i propose we start tomorrow 
first light 
we ll cross
the middle fingers 
we ll find the tugboat
on the dune 
we ll go see jupiter
and oracle 
they ll know what to do 
let s take a vote 
all in favor say  aye  
  aye 
  nay 
who s the nay sayer 
  him 
  me 
that kid is gonna get us all
put to sleep  euthanized 
we won t find the dog 
but we will die trying 
not a bad way to go 
you re out voted  anyway 
science party candidate
professor watanabe
has been placed
under house arrest today
at toho mountain ryokan
after offering sharp criticism
last night
of the
kobayashi administration s
canine saturation crisis
policy 
foreign exchange
student walker 
thank you  editor hiroshi 
you all know me 
i speak my mind 
and sometimes
that ruffles some feathers 
please  forgive my bluntness 
mayor kobayashi is a crook 
and i hate him 
right now 
he faces a divided congress
during a hotly contested
re election year 
dogs are dying
on a miserable island 
gullible masters
have been brainwashed 
the science party candidate
is being held against his will
with no recourse
to legal counsel 
somebody is up to something 
you have
a conspiracy theory 
i have a hunch 
i don t print hunch 
huh 
i ll spell it out 
i believe
municipal dome propaganda
has deliberately stoked
irrational  anti dog fear
and suppressed a medically
proven dog flu treatment
in order to promote
a secret campaign
to turn the country against
its innocent house pets 
there  i said it 
can you prove it 
i don t know 
to tell you the truth 
i don t know 
part two 
 the search for spots  
the middle fingers
of trash island
wind and weave up river 
inter stitched
by zig zagging pipe lines
and rusty viaducts 
the ruins of
a failed utility complex
washed out by tsunami 
the rubble of an abandoned
power plant
demolished by earthquake 
the remains of a deserted
industrial estate
destroyed by volcanic blast 
the old trash island
athletic club 
member less
and long forgotten 
okay  i got a question 
what s your favorite food 
a double portion
of doggy chop from the can
mixed into a bowl
of broken puppy snaps
with a vitamin
crushed up into it 
king s the spokes dog
for that 
he s the doggy chop dog 
mmm  used to be 
was that
your daily meal 
not always  my master
was a school teacher 
we weren t rich 
you know  you 
a center cut kobe
rib eye  seared 
on the bone 
with salt and pepper 
wow 
it was my birthday
supper  every year 
mine s hot sausage 
yakitori style 
the snack vendor always
saved me one on game days 
  hmm  duke 
  ah  green tea ice cream 
my master had a sweet tooth 
i probably inherited it
from her 
you heard the rumor  right 
about doggy chop 
remind us again 
what rumor 
oh  they folded 
oh  no 
doggy    doggy chop folded 
how about you  chief 
what was your favorite food 
me  oh  i don t care 
garbage  trash 
scraps of rubbish 
  i m used to left overs 
  hmm 
yeah  yeah 
of course 
i wasn t always a stray 
wait  what d you say 
i said i wasn t always
a stray 
  really  since when 
  tell us about that 
i ve been hunted by
dog catchers all my life 
i m not easy to trap 
i ve only got three captures
on my record
where i actually got sent
to the pound  i mean 
and the first two times 
i escaped within 24 hours 
but the third time   
i got adopted before i could
finish digging
the break out tunnel 
it was a big family 
five kids 
two other dogs  already 
they stuck me
in the back of a station wagon
and drove me out
to the middle of the sticks 
grass  trees  swimming pool 
cartoons on tv 
anyway  one morning
a week later 
the youngest boy 
his name was toshiro 
woke me up at 6 15 
bright eyed  wide awake 
and he tried to pet me 
he didn t mean anything by it 
he was just being friendly 
apparently  i bit him so hard 
i nearly chewed his hand off 
blood all over
the kitchen floor 
they rushed him
to the emergency room
and i got pad locked out
in the tool shed
with the lights out 
it gave me some time to think 
what happened 
why did i do that 
to this day  i have no idea 
i guess he scared me 
i bite 
that night  an old woman 
she must ve been
the grandmother
brought me out a bowl of some
homemade hibachi chili 
i like to think she cooked it
for me 
personally  but who knows 
maybe it was just
more left overs  but   
you ve got a tick 
anyway  that s my favorite
food i ever ate 
the old woman made
a great bowl of chili 
what happened after that 
i dug my way out by morning 
jumped on the back
of a dump truck 
and hitched back to megasaki 
i was always a street dog 
let s face it 
somebody s stalking us 
as you know  we all hate dogs 
chairman fujimoto san 
president of
kobayashi pharmaceutical 
you secretly introduced
mega quantities
of infected fleas
and contagious tick larvae
into a metropolitan
city center 
creating an unprecedented
animal disease out break 
thank you 
general yamatachi san 
commander of the megasaki
municipal task force 
you oversaw the deportation
of over 750 000 caged animals
to a nearly uninhabitable
off shore refuse center 
good work 
supervisor kitano san 
director
of kobayashi robotics 
you developed the most
promising artificial life form
in the history
of corporate technology 
and a powerful new weapon 
to boot 
well done 
yakuza nakamura san 
head of
the clenched fist gang 
you eliminated
all pro dog opposition
through the use of bribery 
extortion  intimidation 
and violent force 
my compliments 
brains have been washed 
wheels have been greased 
fear has been mongered 
now we prepare
for the final stage
of our conspiracy theory 
the permanent end
to the canine
saturation crisis 
we believe we ve
recovered a viable dna sample
from this article
of damaged aviation equipment 
we re going to check it
right now
if you care to observe 
we call upon
dog lovers everywhere
to harken
to this transmission 
may day  may day 
unscheduled junior turbo prop
in severe distress
over sapporo river 
engine failure  and 
 detachment of left wing 
will attempt emergency landing
on trash island coast 
please  make note
of the following 
to my security detail  
bodyguard dog 
spots kobayashi 
if still living 
i leave
all my worldly possessions 
if spots has preceded me
into the next life 
i ask that everything 
including my own bones
and spots  carcass 
be burned
in a crematory furnace 
with our ashes scattered
to the four winds 
it will not amount to much
pollution in this sad land 
if i survive 
ignore this message 
i ve gone to find my dog 
young masters
of megasaki  unite 
turpentine brandy

and warms the dog bones

really  thank you
very much  wow 
to whom it may concern

  no 
she understands t v 
you seek a dog named spots 
  dog zero 
  dog zero 
as you know  most of
the animals on this island
come from human homes
with domesticated
back grounds 
however  a small population
of savage  aboriginal dogs
have been scavenging
the metropolitan
dumping grounds
for nearly a decade 
the graffiti on this wall
depicts the story 
they were born into captivity
on the ends of the fringes
of the most distant reaches
of the island 
they endured
great suffering and cruelty
at the hands
of their former masters 
finally  in the wake of
an act of god  they escaped 
to a harsh
and desperate freedom 
some say they died away
over the subsequent years 
starving and forgotten 
some say they swam
to the mainland 
but this seems unlikely 
too far to dog paddle 
some say
they re still with us 
in the far away cuticles 
beyond the middle fingers 
we know the animal you seek 
he has appeared
in oracle s visions 
a prophecy suggests itself 
spots  if he s alive 
may very well be living 
even at this moment 
as a captive prisoner
abducted into the company
of these wild  savage dogs 
oracle  what do you think 
what 
continue your journey 
have faith in your cause 
luck and good fortune
be unto you 
you heard the rumor  right 
about these aboriginal dogs 
  remind me again 
  what s the rumor 
uh  they re cannibals 
so you re telling me they re
going to want to eat us 
well  they re cannibals 
we re approaching
the end of old trash island 
to the west  the sapporo river
and megasaki city 
to the east  the open sea 
to the north  a long  rickety
cause way
over a noxious sludge marsh
leading to
a radio active land fill
polluted by toxic
chemical garbage 
  that s our destination 
  great 
got it 
get ready to jump 
atari  i m going to drag you
overboard with my teeth 
since you can t understand
the plan 
after that 
we re back on foot

how did this happen 
what s going on
with this contraption 
if we get separated 
which we are 
rendez vous at the cause way 
you re not our leader

we all are 
let s take a vote 
all in favor of my plan 
which is to rendez vous
at the cause way   
let s go 
no  you can t ride
the pagoda slide

anyway  let s go 
we made an emergency plan 
even if we didn t get to vote
and agree to it yet 
rendez vous at the cause way
to the far away cuticles 
and go find your dog 
maybe everybody else
just got crushed 
compacted  and incinerated 
but we re going to be there

no  the ear piece
is how i receive
my commands and instructions
and so on 
obviously  i m privy to
certain sensitive information
due to my position
in the mayoral household
at brick mansion 
oh  so you mean
somebody could be talking
to you right now 
well  the range is only about
75 feet or so  i guess  so   
battery s probably dead 
anyway 
i got a question for you 
how much money
do you think the mayor makes 
i can t tell you that 
that s highly confidential 
um  anyway  i m not
the mayor s accountant s dog 
that s butterscotch 
and she got crushed
in a glass compactor
the day before yesterday 
no  my duties
are  uh  focused entirely
on the protection
of the mayor s ward  atari 
i m not supposed
to be his friend 
but i love him very much 
but that s a private matter 
um  the only reason
i even said that
was because we re all probably
going to die out here
and i ll never see him again 
that s a tough break 
well  good luck to you
and watch out
for the cannibal dogs 
  hmm 
  hmm 
  what 
  what 
watch out for the    
the cannibal dogs 
they are dogs that eat dogs 
start over and repeat again 
you know what 
don t even worry about that 
i just heard there might be
some wild  aboriginal 
cannibal dogs
in the area  you know 
but i wouldn t worry
because you re
in an extra security
lock cell 
look at it that way 
you re probably safer
than i am 
except from thirst
and starvation 
it s got an extra security
lock on it 
you ll never get it open 
are you going to eat me now 
what did you say 
are you going to eat me now 
i heard
you were cannibal dogs 
be notified  i ll be compelled
to defend myself
with all means at my disposal 
hmm 
who told you that dirty lie 
we resorted to cannibalism
on one occasion 
many months ago 
as a desperate
survival instinct 
we ate one single dog 
his name was fuzzball 
and he was the leader
of our pack 
and he was already in a coma
from starvation 
  so we put him out of his   
  his   
his misery and   
and   
consumed him 
we would have dropped dead
in a week or less
without that nourishment 
we were dying 
do you judge us for that 
shame on you 
we only brought you here
in the first place
to help you 
we ve got a master pass key 
open his cage 
fuzzball was his best friend 
oh  dear 
uh  i think i offended him 
i m truly sorry 
i had no idea 
what is this place 
how long have you been here 
i can see
you ve been mistreated 
are you okay 
my name is spots 
spots kobayashi 
how can i be of service
to you 
master atari san 
can you hear me 
can you hear me  master atari 
spots u 
you re not safe here 
you shouldn t have
come for me 
i can t
protect you efficiently
under these conditions 
spots u 
here i come 
sic  em 
follow me 
all in favor of kicking
chief out of the pack
and never speaking
to him again  say  aye  
aye 
how did you do that 
secret tooth  military issue 
technically  i could do it
37 more times 
but i wouldn t be able
to chew my meat 
i assume you re spots 
we ve been looking for you 
master atari san 
i swore an oath when i assumed
the responsibilities
of official bodyguard dog
to the mayoral household 
i could never be persuaded
to break that vow
for any reason whatsoever 
i ll always be loyal to you
as my only
and unconditional master 
but circumstances
have radically changed for me
and all the pets
of megasaki city 
i have new obligations
which i never anticipated 
i ve become the leader
of a tribe of outcasts
who depend on me
for their survival 
and i m going to be a father 
with deepest sadness
and humility 
i must ask you to relieve me
of the duties of my position 
effective immediately 
you son of a bitch 
if we don t drown  i m going
to strangle you myself 
i don t care
how many exploding teeth
you try to spit out at me 
do you have any idea
what that little pilot
just went through
to try to rescue you 
how dare you 
  you re a stray 
  yeah  so what 
what s your name 
who cares 
you re from central megasaki 
i can tell by the accent 
you re a short haired oceanic 
speckle ear sport hound mix 
you were born in a storm sewer
on bamboo shoot holiday
six years ago today 
do you know me 
i    i don t    i don t know 
i m your older brother
by five minutes 
it s been a long time  chief

before the volcano erupted
and an earthquake
triggered the tsunami
which obliterated
the facility

incarcerated animals
here on the premises
being experimented on
against their will 
if you look closely  you may
notice some of these dogs
still bear scars and markings
from the research and abuse

 atari s lantern  
not fair 
to dogs 
  not fair 
  to dogs 
  not fair 
  to dogs 
there will never be a place
for dog flu in megasaki city 
there will never be room
for snout fever
in uni prefecture 
the time has come to put
the violent  intimidating 
unsanitary bad dogs
of trash island
humanely to sleep 
for their own good 
and also  ours 
general yamatachi 
bring out the replacement pet 
sit o

re election night tally

let s go 
this landslide re election
is a massive fraud 
and we demand a re count 
respect o 
the mayor is allowing
the unauthorized
pro dog student protestors
a platform to voice
their dissenting beliefs 
mayor kobayashi
has dog s blood
on his hands  you all do 
atari was a hero 
professor watanabe
was murdered 
the serum works 
the mayor is a crook 
and i hate him 
this small minority

to agitate disorder
and incite anarchy 
i hereby cancel and nullify

student walker s
senior high school study visa

to bring him the red button 
nutmeg 
holy smokes 
my lungs feel clear 
my equilibrium feels balanced 
my vision is sharp as a tack
for the first time in months 
wow  that s a great serum 
master atari  whose death 
i think we can say 
appears to have been
inaccurately reported 
has asked to read a statement
to the general assembly 
he will then withdraw
from the debate
and respond
to no further questions 
dear editor hiroshi
of the megasaki senior high
daily manifesto 
in a series
of first rate articles
by an attractive cub reporter
on your staff 
you shine a spot light
on the great injustice
that has occurred
under the kobayashi
administration 
i have spent much of my time
in recent weeks
traveling in the company
of the very kind of animals
our mayor refers to
as  bad dogs  
they are the finest
living beings
i have ever come to know
in all my dozen years
on this earth 
to your readers 
the good people of megasaki 
i say  the cycle of life
always hangs
in a delicate balance 
who are we 
and who do we want to be 
who are we 
i wrote a haiku
to try to express my feelings
about the suffering dogs
of trash island 
it is also about nature  love 
friendship  eternity 
and a black owl 
i call it  atari s lantern 
he said a haiku 
i ll tell you later 
i dedicate this poem
to my distant uncle 
mayor kobayashi 
who took me in
when i myself was a stray dog
with nowhere else to turn 
editor hiroshi 
please extend my subscription
for an additional year 
i enclose a check in the
amount of one thousand yen 
signed  atari kobayashi 
former ward
to the mayoral household 
hmm 
not fair to the boy 
not fair to the dog 
he says   i have no honor  
hmm 
holy moses 
the mayor
has just officially
unstamped
the trash island decree 
no kidding 
major domo
is accusing the mayor
of breaking
his campaign promise 
he s steaming mad 
it s gonna be a fight 
spit him with a tooth 
i can t get a clean shot 
too many innocent protesters 
i ll be right back 
escape 
escape  escape 
escape 
well  the brain surgery
was a complete success 
but his left kidney failed
due to the stress
of the operation 
but  what about
the right one 
he lost it in a train crash
three years ago 
take my left kidney   
give it to atari kun 
according
to a long standing statute
unique to uni prefecture 
in the event of the death 
disappearance 
or felony prosecution
of the chosen candidate
on  while  during 
or concurrent
with the re election night
ceremony 
all powers and authorities
vested in his or her
designated office
transfer forthwith
to his or her
next of kin and or
appointed heir 
in other words 
atari kobayashi is the new
mayor of megasaki city 
you heard me right 
atari kobayashi
is the new mayor
of megasaki city 
let s hope
that new kidney works 
boy  what a night 
life in uni prefecture
returned to a comfortable
tranquility 
the megasaki dragons
ended their winning streak
with a staggering loss
to the honda goblins 
doggy chop re opened
all 11
of its domestic factories 
and puppy snaps
resumed production
with an improved product 
graft and political corruption
were reduced to sustainable 
acceptable levels 
the dog flu serum
cured every breathing animal
in the region 
some say
a few lost dogs
continue to roam and scavenge
on trash island 
however  these
rumors remain unconfirmed 
mayor atari 
we all agree
it should be a crime
to abuse  beat  murder
or yell at any dog
in megasaki city 
that is not the question 
the question is 
what is the appropriate
punishment 
exactly  and the answer is 
death penalty 
that seems excessive to us 
possibly  anyway 
we should make it
at least 30 days
community service
and a fine
of no less than 250 000 yen 
meeting adjourned 
i m standing by  master atari 
so how does it feel
to be a former stray 
hmm  i take it
one day at a time 
last week  i nearly be handed
an industrial lobbyist
from west suzuki 
they had to give him
a blood transfusion 
he probably had it coming 
maybe  learned any new tricks 
actually  yes  just one 
can i see it 
i m supposed to be juggling
ten bowling pins
engulfed in flames
over my tail at this point 
but you just have to imagine
that part 
i can picture it 
you still against bringing
puppies into this world 
i ll tell you
when i get to know you better 
fair enough 
my friends think
i like to fight 
but it s just not true 
sometimes i lose my temper
and blow off a little steam 
but i ve never enjoyed it
