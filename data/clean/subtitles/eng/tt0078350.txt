go on in 
sergeant 
who the hell are you

  not closing  outgoing 
check him out   
      and tell him to put his hands down 
  yes  sir 
  what have you got 
  estimated speed  7 miles per hour 
  seven 
  whatever it is  it s big 
slater to air search one 
contact and identify outgoing objects 
bearing 183 degrees 
distance  30 miles 
estimated speed  7 miles per hour 
repeat  that s 7 miles per hour  not 700 
air search one to topkick  roger 
air search one to topkick 
we have visual contact 
identify 
a black mass  a moving black mass 
zero altitude  dead ahead 
  they re hitting us 
  oh  my god 
we re out of control 
oh  my god  bees  millions of bees 
air search two to base 
  bees  millions of bees 
  bees 
they re all around me now 
all over the canopy  trying to get in 
  get above them  man  take it up 
  i can t  sir  i m losing power 
oh  my god 
he s down  sir 
good lord 
call hastings air force base 
have them scramble and track those bees 
major  bring him in here 
this is capt  cord at the missile complex 
this is a top priority order
from gen  slater 
scramble aircraft and track a swarm
of bees 30 miles from the complex 
yes  bees 
now  what s his story 
  bradford crane  sir 
  that all 
ph  d   institute of advanced study 
princeton  via cambridge 
  english 
  american  for the last eight years 
dr  crane   
   you re in big trouble 
  what are you doing in this complex 
  i saw the swarms early this morning 
there were so many
they almost blotted out the sun 
i followed them 
but when i got here they were gone 
then i saw the missile gates open
and i thought they d flown down here 
i came to see if anybody was alive 
if i could help 
  in his van 
  scientific equipment 
  what kind  sabotage  explosives 
  biological  we re checking it out 
  who are you 
  i m an entomologist 
  bugs 
  insects  what i do is not important 
what is important  critical   
   is that there are other swarms 
and what these bees did here   
   they can do all over the southwest   
      and ultimately all over the country 
  are you saying bees killed the men here 
  yes  just like your choppers 
  i don t know what happened to those yet 
i do know thousands of people
are stung by bees every year 
it s rare if anybody dies from bee stings 
  they have to be african  don t they 
  african killer bees 
  yes 
  i ve read their progress reports 
if they ever manage to come this far north 
it s 10 years away at the earliest 
by whose timetable  general 
yours or theirs 
either you re some crackpot   
   or there s a direct tie up
between what s happened here and you 
we can clear that up  and we d better 
kick on your com system and connect
to dr  connors in the white house 
  arthur connors  the president s advisor 
  that s him 
are you trying to cite him as
your authority for being in this complex 
dr  connors hasn t the foggiest idea
whether i m on or under this complex 
  but i have to speak to him right now 
  lock him up 
  yes  sir 
  general  thank god you got here  sir 
  what 
  this is dr  anderson 
she managed to get six men
into the hospital in time to isolate them 
two are dead  the others are critical 
i need antitoxins 
  i have cardiopep compound in my van 
  cardiopep 
i just read an article about cardiopep   
   by some scientist named crane  i think 
our preliminary results are encouraging 
you re crane 
yes  our tests indicate
cardiopep normalizes irregular heartbeat 
now  wait a minute  we re not using
experimental substances on these men 
this is his area 
it seems to me if he feels 
i don t give a damn  you re the doctor 
tell me what you need 
  i ll have them here in 30 minutes 
  that s the problem  i don t know 
none of the usual procedures help 
i need to talk to an immunologist 
get the center for disease control
on the horn 
the best immunologist in the country
is walter krim in virginia 
you ll find his card in my wallet  call him 
  go ahead 
  i know him very well 
i d be pleased to talk to him 
all right  go with him 
  what happened here  captain 
  i m sorry  you mean you don t know 
not exactly 
  we were attacked by bees 
  attacked 
i was in the hospital bunker
when i heard the alarm 
i turned on the video control unit 
saw what was happening 
our men aboveground
were literally covered with bees 
i used an air conditioning duct to get to
pod three and lead the standby crew out 
the bees attacked us
when we reached the hospital bunker 
i managed to get six men inside 
it s damn hard to believe   
   that insects have accomplished
what nothing in the world could ve done   
   except germ warfare or a neutron bomb 
neutralize an icbm site 
okay  let s go  come on  paul 
  all right 
  isn t this beautiful 
neat 
here  paul  take this 
  here you go  hon 
  thanks  babe 
paul  look at that over there 
i think there s a waterfall
we can go to after 
  hand me the cups  please 
  sure 
would you go to the car
and get the thermos 
sure  mom 
go away 
  it s just a bee  leave him alone 
  they re into everything 
i ll get them  get out of the way  honey 
i think that s enough 
you ll wreck the food  i m hungry 
it s hot 
  hey  wait for paul 
  i can t  i m starving 
mom  dad  look 
dad  come on  get in the car 
mom 
dad 
mom 
mom 
dad 
gen  thompson coming on screen 
general  we ve received
and decoded your report 
we re having credibility problems
with the nature of the attack 
specifically  with your statement
it was not a chemical warfare strike 
we can find no evidence of that  sir 
your suggestion is the attack
is of natural origin  what is that 
i m having the same problem accepting
that swarms of bees attacked 
has that civilian been cleared  general 
no  sir 
what is he doing in our complex 
when i arrived with my special defense
unit  he was already inside the complex 
he claims he walked in
through the open gate 
i am dr  brad crane  an entomologist 
i asked your man here to check
my credentials with dr  arthur connors 
so far  nobody believes me 
i have been placed in custody 
every minute now is precious 
we have been invaded by an enemy
far more lethal than any human force 
dr  crane  we re going to check
with the white house 
dr  connors had better know you 
for your sake 
   afternoon  felix 
   afternoon  ma am 
  how are you feeling today 
  now that you re here  just fine 
nicely said 
everything s looking pretty  maureen 
including you 
thank you  clarence 
the wire and the pliers  please 
felix  think that rigging
is going to keep my banner up 
just because you re mayor of marysville
doesn t make you an engineer 
don t be worrying about my rigging 
she ll stay up in a hurricane 
i was thinking how corny your banner
reads  makes us look like hicks 
nobody asked you to leave houston
and retire here  you know 
clarence  that s not nice 
we ve been doing fine
with our flower festival for years   
   until this master mechanic genius
came to tell us how to run things 
actually  the sign is sort of hicky 
that s what people expect 
the hammer  too  that s why
thousands flock here each year   
   to see the parade
and our beautiful flower floats 
that s right 
we ll grant you  felix  this isn t pasadena 
it isn t the rose bowl 
it s a pretty fair country town imitation 
i ll tell you one thing i do approve of 
this year s theme  love 
  now that was clarence s idea 
  that s right 
everybody s got to have one good idea
now and then   
      even clarence 
  now look  felix 
mom  dad 
this way  quick 
they killed my mom and my dad 
yes  sir 
we ll do the best we can  sir 
and thank you  sir 
gen  thompson coming on screen 
dr  crane  your credentials
have been authenticated 
nothing more 
while i confess to being surprised
at events   
   but the president has placed you
in direct command   
   of all operations relating
to this present emergency 
what are the limits to my authority 
none 
  gen  slater 
  yes  sir 
you will provide dr  crane
with full cooperation 
you will give him equipment  whatever
facilities and manpower he needs 
all this is to be made available
to him without question 
  without question  sir 
  affirmative 
  dr  crane 
  yes 
the president s advisor  dr  connors   
   told me he ll be calling you
within an hour   
   and i d like to join with him
in wishing you good luck 
thank you 
major  when you checked
the non lethal equipment in my van   
   did you come across
a beat up briefcase 
  yes  sir 
  are you familiar with its contents 
yes  sir  an inventory of the contents
is in the process of being typed 
correction  sir  was being typed 
thank you  i want the particular file
that i d marked  personnel    
      to give to gen  slater 
  yes  sir 
while you re about it 
could i have my leather pouch 
  the one with the sunflower seeds 
  sergeant   
   would you get the items he requested 
the file contains the names  addresses
and numbers of everyone i want flown in 
just tell them the war i ve always
talked about has finally started 
  that s all  they ll drop everything 
  i m counting on it 
  anything else 
  yes  in that same briefcase   
   there is a list of equipment  get
the pentagon s top procurement man   
   and get everything on that list
flown here not later than tomorrow 
why here 
we re setting up headquarters here 
time is the one thing we re short on 
now  i want to talk
to the survivors  please 
  take dr  crane to capt  anderson 
  yes  sir  come with me  please 
brother 
major   
   you were an investigative officer
in intelligence previously  right 
that s correct  sir 
okay  i m assigning you to this dr  crane   
   as his personal military liaison 
watch every move he makes 
build me a dossier on him 
i can t believe he just happened to be here
at the moment   
   a swarm of bees hit this complex   
   and that he d already prepared
with such remarkable foresight   
   a list of personnel and equipment
to be flown in here 
it does seem strange  sir 
  stay with the son of a bitch 
  yes  sir 
this man is the most stable 
but his heart rate is still 120 
take another blood sample
just before dr  krim gets here 
that would be three hours at the outside 
infirmary  major baker 
hold on a minute  capt  anderson 
dr  anderson 
oh  my god 
  i m leaving right now 
  what is it 
the bees are moving towards marysville 
they killed all the durants except paul 
  i must go to him 
  i ll go with you  major  you drive 
paul durant 
  c 4 
  thank you 
there s a bee in here  please  help 
there s a bee in here 
  relax  paul  take it easy 
  get him away  kill him 
  paul 
  doctor  would you let him go  please 
  do what he says  tomas 
  back away 
paul  listen to me 
  there is no bee in this room 
  yes  there is 
you are having a nightmare 
only a nightmare 
can you hear me  paul 
the bee is not real 
paul  i promise you it isn t 
now  reach out and it will go away 
you ll see 
now please  paul  reach out 
reach out  paul 
please trust me 
reach out  further  go on 
there  you see  paul 
  no bee 
  everything i tried failed 
i was afraid i was going to lose him 
i know how special he is to you 
so i called you 
  thank you 
  how many times was he stung 
  i removed two stingers 
  that s one break 
  he s not full of venom 
  but he s delirious   
      muttering about this giant bee 
  it was big  it was really big 
about half the size of this room 
he s gone now  it was only in your mind 
and he won t be back 
  i have to go 
  dr  crane   
   thank you for helping me 
contact the complex  please  two things 
gen  slater must assign helicopters
to start a search pattern   
   radiating from the site
where the durants were attacked 
the helicopters must take
no aggressive action if they spot a swarm 
we re gathering information 
not counterattacking 
  clear 
  clear 
second item  have the complex call me
the moment dr  krim is about to land 
here come your choppers  as ordered 
thank you  general 
no  thanks 
  high in potassium  low in sodium 
  terrific 
sergeant  start your patterns 
start your dispersal pattern
in sectors a and b 
report immediately
any sighting of swarms 
roger 
tell us what you re looking for 
we ll try to help 
i m looking for bees 
unfortunately  they washed down
the durant car before we got to it 
look 
doesn t look like a bee to me 
plastic 
it s a piece of a plastic cup 
there are pieces all around here 
look  there  there 
what s so significant about that 
i m afraid to speculate   
   but i think the bees did this 
you re saying these bees eat plastic 
no  but i m wondering 
your american honey bee
has a weak mouth 
it couldn t even break the skin of a grape 
but it looks like this species
is tearing up plastic cups   
   possibly to line their hives 
now  if this is true 
they didn t just get here 
i mean  the invasion didn t just now begin 
they have been here some time 
breeding  increasing 
so 
suppose these bees   
   are using plastic to insulate their hives 
no bee is that smart 
suppose these african bees are 
walter 
got a message for you from mrs  krim 
carol is furious at me
for dragging you back to work 
she wonders if you think
i m the only immunologist in the world 
that s what you ve always told me 
ready to go to work  dr  krim 
now i am  dr  crane 
  this is gen  slater 
  just let me know what you need 
thank you  we ve got to move fast 
i agree   
   and in my opinion 
the fastest move is a quick knockout 
not necessarily  general 
it s only the final result that counts 
thank you  brad 
the hallucinations
seem to be disappearing 
that s right 
none of the patients have had
a recurrence in the past few hours 
you re doing everything you can for them 
  keep these ivs going 
  yes  sir 
is there any other antitoxin
we could ve used 
if he is right and the bees that stung them
were african   
   the answer s probably no 
got nothing in our bag for them 
not yet anyway 
cardiopep might have eased
their palpitations   
   but it s no final antidote 
call me if there s any change in these men 
  they don t look very good  do they 
  i m afraid not 
you still refuse to oil this 
i don t intend
to be stuck in this thing forever 
have you finally met some miracle healer 
i m studying tibetan levitation 
in a few hundred years 
i expect to be able to float around 
  you still writing dirty books 
  not this year 
raunchiest thing i ever read   
   that paper of yours on the mating habits
of bombus medius 
those queen bees really are something 
sergeant  this is dr  krim 
the two officers with major baker
are drs  richards and moore 
until they finish their work 
you don t admit anyone 
have someone oil these wheels later 
you okay  brad 
yeah 
go on  i ll handle this part
and call you when i m ready 
walter   
   thanks for coming over here so quickly 
  problem  doctor 
  about what 
i noticed that dr  crane
seemed uneasy in here 
can t imagine why anyone would
be uneasy around all these dead men 
can you  major 
is the man coming or isn t he 
yes  sir  the general is coming 
but you have to wait outside 
what s this about shutting off our water 
  are you in charge 
  yes  i m gen  slater 
i m jud hawkins 
i asked these tin soldiers
if i could see my son   
   and they tell me it s impossible 
who s your son 
why do you think he s here 
because he was stupid enough
to join your damn outfit 
his name is mark 
airman mark hawkins 
he s stationed here 
i want to see him 
i m afraid that s not possible  not yet 
i ll tell you what makes it possible 
me being the county engineer 
that makes it possible 
do you understand me  general 
out of the question 
i control all the damn water
in this county   
   and by god  i ll shut yours off
unless i get to see my son 
i ll shut this whole base down
in 10 minutes 
you won t even have enough water
to flush your toilets when i m through 
i m not sure you have the authority
to do that to a federal installation 
while you re checking with your superiors
to find out if i have the authority   
   i ll be turning those valves 
now  you listen to me 
word is  them same bees
that killed the durant family   
   killed a whole lot of men on this base
this morning 
i want to see my son 
i want to find out if he s alive 
and i mean right now 
all right  mr  hawkins  open it up 
come with me 
anything 
the toxic content in their tissue
is the highest i ve ever found 
it s more virulent than the venom
of the australian brown box jellyfish 
if that baby taps you 
you have two minutes to say your prayers 
that s it  then 
looks like your nightmare
has finally arrived 
the combined venom
delivered by three or more of these bees   
   may be a fatal dosage
to the average human being 
the victim would be unconscious
in a minute 
we ve been losing the battle
against the insects for 15 years   
   but i never thought i d see
the final face off in my lifetime 
and i never dreamed
that it would turn out to be the bees 
  they ve always been our friends 
  until this species evolved 
gen  slater is outside with the next of kin
of one of the dead men 
  he wants to come in here 
  he said it was imperative 
all right 
oh  god  no 
i m afraid you can t take him  mr  hawkins 
the only way you can stop me
is to shoot me   
   and i d thank you if you would 
hubbard  dr  newman 
  thanks for coming 
  glad to help 
you should know i came here reluctantly 
that s better than not at all  now isn t it 
this way  gentlemen 
would you excuse me a moment 
when the others arrive 
give them 30 minutes to unpack   
      then have them go to the briefing room 
  very well 
gentlemen 
rude son of a bitch  isn t he 
never even introduced us 
you d think he was a general 
  he s asked for the duty watch tapes 
  why 
he seems to know there s an automatic
taping system in the duty room 
he wants to audit the tape
just prior to the attack 
i ve already played it back 
nothing that ll help us 
but let him hear it 
  stay with him  build up that dossier 
  yes  sir 
so  what about rita 
she s been slinging hash long enough 
i m gonna marry her 
guys don t do that 
just because they re having a kid 
i love rita  i d marry her whether
we were gonna have a kid or not 
at the tone  mark 0430 
it says we re scheduled to test
the alarm system   
   right after the 0430 mark 
stand by  activating 
  what alarm system is that 
  a fallback   
   in case we lose the phone lines
or radio contact 
what s that 
  just the alarm 
  no  listen 
  jerry  do you hear what i m hearing 
  yeah 
duty officer  right away  sir 
   like a couple of million chain saws 
that came from the corridor 
cover me  i ll go look 
jerry  behind you 
my god 
  dr  crane  they re ready for you now 
  okay 
keep the tapes on the machine 
i want to hear them again 
  how s paul 
  recovering  thank you 
that s good 
good morning  ladies  gentlemen 
please forgive the haste and secrecy
with which you ve been summoned here 
the fact is  we ve been invaded by
a mutant species of the african killer bee 
crane  if i may 
yes  dr  hubbard 
i was sent by the president to help 
but i think you re dead wrong 
i was one of the first people
sent to brazil   
   when the african killer bee
began proliferating there 
we prefer to call these mutants
the brazilian bee  not african 
i m well aware of that  dr  hubbard 
i ve been tracking their progress north   
   and there is no evidence whatsoever   
   that they ve yet crossed
central america  let alone arrived here 
apparently  they came directly across
the caribbean from venezuela 
there were three hurricanes
in that ocean tract this season 
any one of them
could have swept the bees in 
much of this land is used
to cultivate flowers 
a perfect breeding ground 
with all appropriate respect
to the men who died here   
   there is no proof the bees
that killed them were brazilian 
or  if you insist  african 
what they re called
isn t as important as what they are 
and what they are clearly is a mutant
species of the original african killer bee 
dr  krim will explain 
the autopsies confirm that the venom   
   is deadlier than anything
we ve ever encountered 
it appears there s enough poison
in just four stings   
   to kill the average person 
i won t dispute my learned colleague 
but   
   it takes 26 tests
to identify the african bee 
how many tests have you made so far 
major 
you re looking at the final test
i made this morning   
   from the one dead bee that we found 
notice the 18 vein intersection
on the forewing   
   and the 17 separate angles
of the hamuli 
only one bee has that configuration   
   and that is the african killer bee 
major 
dr  hubbard   
   i would appreciate it if you would
head up our environmental team 
dr  newman will be in charge
of the genetic counterattack 
dr  krim will try to develop
a mass antidote   
   to save the lives of future victims 
because of the danger to nearby
marysville  if the bees attack again   
   i ve invited mayor tuttle and
school superintendent ms  schuster   
   to attend this briefing 
any comment 
mayor tuttle 
thank you 
in view of what you ve told us 
i ll set up a town council meeting 
i ll see that our air raid warning system
is repaired 
it hasn t worked in some time 
if the bees come back  at least
we can warn people to take shelter 
a very practical approach 
ms  schuster 
the idea of those killer bees
coming back is petrifying 
i ll alert all my teachers
to be prepared for the worst 
i appreciate your thoughtfulness
in asking us to this briefing 
  thank you  dr  crane 
  you re welcome  ms  schuster 
any further comment 
what s our timetable 
eight hour shifts  around the clock 
seven days a week 
i meant  what s the length of our program 
how long can we expect to be here 
until we have destroyed the african bee   
   or it has destroyed us 
  you guys ready 
  yeah 
  give me the binoculars and let s go 
  okay 
   morning 
  hi  boys 
 morning  rita 
 morning  mr  austin 
instead of the usual  i ll just have coffee 
  all right 
  i ll get it  rita 
 morning  felix 
a man would think
you d let her have some time off 
at least let her go to the missile base   
   and pick up jerry s things 
i told her 
i even said to her   rita   
     go home for a few days
and pull yourself together   
and she said 
 if i went home  and stared at them
four walls  knowing jerry s gone   
     i m just liable to take his service pistol
and blow my head off    she said that 
she s better off pretending
it never happened 
pretending them killer bees
never got up here 
i bet i can guess what schoolteacher
them roses belong to 
you don t need no crystal ball for that 
the way i hear it 
maureen is favoring you over clarence 
  i sure am counting on it 
  yes  sir  the gossip is   
   the odds have shifted in your favor 
now  them is my kind of odds 
  i gotta be going 
  so soon 
  yeah  but i ll be seeing you 
  have a good day 
  oh  maureen 
   morning  felix 
  i got you some roses 
  oh  felix  they are lovely 
i usually get apples 
oh  maureen  i   
something wrong  felix 
i m not too good with words   
   but i am a retired master mechanic   
   and my education  well   
   it s all in these hands 
and i know you know
what i m trying to say 
your roses speak for you 
most eloquently 
thank you 
and i m mindful of it 
then there is hope for me 
oh  look at the time  i d better hurry 
how d it look for me to be late for school 
let me help you 
and i ll keep your roses near me 
  as a reminder 
  thank you 
  i ll see you real soon 
  you will 
   bye 
   bye 
we ll come back later 
we have to plan this just right 
these aren t just any old bees 
this is your reporter anne macgregor 
we re heading for marysville
to investigate the report   
   of a savage attack by bees
at a family picnic 
it resulted in the death of a mother
and father  and serious injury to their son 
my next report   
  kill it 
  yes  sir 
we ve picked up a huge swarm 
on this scale  that puts it
only 200 miles from houston 
i can have choppers there in half an hour 
eliminate them before they get away 
  with what 
  airborne chemical agents 
may we talk  alone 
sure 
i don t recall our discussion
about the use of chemicals 
now  listen 
my orders are to assist you
in your scientific endeavors   
   not to consult with you
on military matters   
   which are none
of your damn concern  sir 
general  please 
these bees are of joint concern 
they kill americans without regard
for whether or not they should salute you 
there will be no airdrops of any kind
until i give the okay 
your okay  huh 
then perhaps i can persuade you
to attack this particular swarm 
now that we know where it is 
attack and eliminate it 
possibly  if you can explain to me   
   how you airdrop chemicals
without killing native insects 
if your chemical kills the african bee
it ll also kill the american bee  right 
right  better a few american bees
than a lot of american people 
that is the point  general 
the honey bee is vital to the environment 
in america  they pollinate
 6 billion worth of crops 
killing the bee kills the crop 
killing the plants will kill the people 
no  no  general 
there will be no airdrop
until we know what we re dropping   
   and where and how 
excuse me 
what about the airdrop  sir 
sir 
   the 0430 mark 
stand by  activating 
  jerry  do you hear what i m hearing 
  yeah 
what is it 
sounds like
a couple of million chain saws 
that came from the corridor 
cover me  i ll go look 
jerry  behind you 
my god 
oh  god  no  no 
come on  let s get them 
we ve got to kill them this time 
ready  now 
let s get out of here 
i can t imagine where he s gone 
we ve looked everywhere 
he s been running a fever 
i returned him to the clinic after
the funeral  but then he disappeared 
we ll find him 
with everything else you have
on your shoulders  you didn t need this 
i know i m taking you away
from all your responsibilities 
paul is one of them 
besides  i like being with you 
you re the one good thing

helena 
anne macgregor reporting
from marysville 
the swarm left behind
a devastated community 
the town is reeling
under the impact of the vicious raid   
   that left many of their friends
and relations dead 
marysville was preparing
for its annual flower festival 
authorities speculate the nearby fields 
this is frank blair 
we await a statement from the
president s top advisor  dr  connors 
dr  connors is evaluating data
from bradford crane   
   the leading authority
on the deadly african bee 
crane is now at the scene of the tragedy 
  dr  krim 
  did you locate him 
we re trying to get through
on our mobile units  stand by 
every opening into homes  churches 
schools and offices is being closed 
scientific authorities are warning
against overreacting to the threat 
scientists believe this tragedy
is a freak  localized phenomenon   
   and could not possibly be repeated 
take it easy  okay  there we go 
come this way 
clear the way 
  hello 
  krim here 
hi  it s brad 
i just heard about helena  is she all right 
  still unconscious 
  not good 
how are things back there 
damned unsettling development here 
one of those four survivors
of the initial attack   
  yes 
      higgins  the airman   
   with only two stings  he just died 
  what happened 
  he was doing fine 
i was thinking of releasing him 
within minutes  his condition
turned critical  all the classical signs   
   of cardiovascular failure 
he was gone before we could reverse it 
keep the survivors there until we can plot
a recovery vs  relapse pattern 
how bad is it in marysville 
about as bad as it can get 
216 dead  33 victims still alive 
we don t know
how many stings per victim 
  we re too busy stabilizing them 
  dr  crane 
i m sorry  i ve got to go  walter 
is it me you re seeing  or a bee 
you 
  dr  crane 
  yes 
gen  slater is on the horn
with washington 
  he requests your presence 
  all right  i ll be back 
  i ll be up 
  no  you won t 
paul  what s the matter 
it s all my fault 
i threw firebombs at the swarm 
you re going to have to tell dr  crane 
i d like to  general  but crane is in charge 
  i just follow orders 
  we ll check them out here 
right  i ll keep in touch 
general 
crane  it s panic time from coast to coast 
if we d gone after the bees
right at the start   
   instead of wasting time
with your science teams   
      we wouldn t be in this damn mess 
  okay  what would you do 
i d evacuate this area 
put up roadblocks across the state   
   and spray the hell out of every tree
and bush from here to the gulf 
let s take that a piece at a time 
why evacuate 
dr  hubbard was out collecting
live african bees 
he s brought them back to the complex 
thousands 
  how 
  they were on the surface of the lake 
thirsty and exhausted 
good  we need specimens 
hold it  i don t see it that way 
the rest of that swarm
could still be in the area 
  major  get the final body count 
  yes  sir 
general 
you haven t answered my question 
  what question 
  why evacuate 
i ve been trying to tell you 
when that swarm finds that their friends
have been taken captive   
   they might come back to marysville 
are you endowing the bees with human
motives  like rescuing their fellow bees 
or seeking revenge on mankind 
i always credit my enemy 
no matter what he may be   
   with equal intelligence 
okay  evacuate marysville 
but not the complex 
  we won t waste time moving facilities 
  agreed 
now  about this spraying every bush
and tree between here and the gulf 
how will you manage that 
send out aircraft 
with radar and pesticides  i d destroy
every african swarm in this country   
   wherever they are 
  major 
 232 dead  sir 
232 dead 
i know that  general 
how will you prevent the wind
from carrying pesticides   
   across cities  parks  farms and schools 
sometimes you have to choose
the lesser of two evils 
ridiculous  general 
you want action and so do i 
we will do it my way 
now  give it a chance 
dr  crane 
  i gotta talk to you 
  okay 
it was my fault   
   what happened here with the bees 
i knew where they were   
   and i should ve told you 
why didn t you 
because they killed my family 
i wanted to get them 
and i did  i got a lot of them 
then the rest of them flew in the air and   
hey  paul 
come on 
i d have done the same thing 
the exact same thing 
you gotta believe me 
now  look at me  paul 
look at me 
when i was a little younger than you   
   just about seven   
   we had a fire where we lived 
i lost my mother and father that night 
it s not good to have to grow up
without a mother and father 
you can ask me  i know firsthand 
i know a lot of unlucky kids
all over the world have to   
   but it sure isn t recommended 
now   
   why don t you go back upstairs   
   and sort of keep an eye
on dr  anderson for me 
  will you do that 
  okay 
good boy 
  dr  crane 
  yes 
can you give us 90 seconds 
  what can i tell you in 90 seconds 
  everything you can  no matter how long 
give me a second for my lead in 
this is anne macgregor
outside the clinic in marysville  texas 
with me is dr  bradford crane   
   who is field director for dr  connors 
the president s science advisor 
how can you prevent this tragedy
from happening elsewhere 
do you have any answers 
at the moment  none 
can the death toll
from bee attacks spread 
that s a possibility 
what s the government doing 
what are your science teams working on 
positive ways to isolate
and eliminate invading swarms 
what positive ways  can you be specific 
  that s tough to do in 90 seconds 
  take all the time you want 
that s the point  i m afraid we don t have
any to spare  excuse me  please 
thank you 
anne macgregor  marysville  texas 
dc ready  not exceeding five volts 
testing five volts 
good 
dc activated 
  how s it going 
  we ll be ready in a minute 
honey coated  three volts at  5 amps 
okay  bring on the gladiators 
i ll stir them up 
pesky little devils 
spread them all over the grid 
they re getting ready to attack 
they re stinging the hell out of the grid 
  we re getting plenty of venom now 
  we need all we can get 
if there s a positive side to the tragedy   
   it s finding these africans
and the queen bees 
with all this venom 
i can really go to work on an antidote 
that s fine 
hubbard  can you have your poison pellets
ready by morning 
by morning 
i don t see how 
that makes your deadline
even earlier  walter 
smells like bananas 
see how fast it dries 
any further complications 
dr  anderson has just examined them 
they re doing well 
dr  anderson  when did she get back 
a short while ago  major 
i couldn t rest
knowing i had sick patients here 
  besides  dr  martinez says i m fine 
  good 
captain  i ve been planning
on having a private talk with you 
it s about this civilian  crane 
i ve received confidential reports
about your association with him   
   which indicate your relationship
is now of a personal nature 
i didn t know
you d assigned anyone to spy on me 
has crane asked you anything about
our operations here  even indirectly 
why should he 
he is a highly respected scientist   
   and has been appointed
by the president to head this project 
it still might be advisable for you
to discontinue the relationship 
with all due respect  sir  what i do
on my off duty time is my business   
   and doesn t concern the air force 
i shall continue to see whomever i wish 
  thank you 
  the doctor wants to say goodbye 
doctor 
oh  yes  rita 
  about the baby  you re both fine 
  oh  good 
  real fine 
  thank you 
please sit down 
with everything happening 
i haven t had a chance to say   
   how sorry i am about jerry 
thank you  doctor 
i ll write to you 
let you know about the baby 
  do you have a place to go 
  not really 
they just gave everyone orders to leave 
of course  there isn t much to stay for 
is there 
goodbye  i have to go 
  the bus is waiting 
  let me walk you to the door 
  i ll see myself out  goodbye 
  good luck 
thank you 
only one suitcase to a person  please 
move it along 
not since the  30s  when thousands
fled the oklahoma dust bowl   
   has a thriving american community
been evacuated 
no flood  fire or hurricane
has turned such a large section   
   into a no man s land  until today 
  slow down 
  that s it  move right along 
on the stairs  please  move forward 
  have you seen ms  schuster 
  no  sir 
continue up to the stairs 
  hal  have you seen ms  schuster 
  no  sir  i haven t 
you boys lose something 
you never did have
a good concept of time 
i remember on our first date
we didn t see the whole double feature 
i was so afraid
you wouldn t catch this train 
here i am  shall we go 
  yeah 
  let go  i had it first 
look  i was carrying her books long before
you showed up in marysville  let go 
clarence  felix 
you promised me
there would be no more fussing 
and this surely isn t the time for it 
let go 
all right  follow the line 
   everything that they hold dear   
   because of killer bees 
imagine having such
a natural phenomenon do something 
take this  give me a hand with her 
get her in the car 
  is the hospital here operating 
  yeah 
thank you 
  you all right 
  it s better 
we ll get you there 
  thank you 
  hold on 
hurry 
enter the car with the number you ve been
issued  that car s number is five 
let s get this train out of here 
the bees could be back any minute 
where is crane 
don t worry  sir  he ll be here in time
to take credit for the evacuation 
let me tell you something  major 
i don t tolerate my staff
saying things behind a man s back 
if you think crane s a glory jockey 
tell him  not me 
if you re trying to butter me up
by slurring a man i consider misguided   
   i don t need a pat on the ass
from you or anyone else 
yes  sir 
am i walking too fast 
no  i m fine  just fine 
don t overdo it 
dr  martinez said you had a close call 
how sad 
how very  very sad 
you know 
marysville was such a happy little town 
ritz s bookstore 
i used to work there
when i was in high school 
everything was happy then 
but that was so long ago 
it s all right 
you can tell a lot about a man
by the way he shuffles cards 
  thank you  clarence 
  wasn t meant as a compliment 
would you like to cut the cards 
  something bothering you 
  what s wrong  maureen 
i got a sudden feeling
i ll never see marysville again 
or any of my children  it s frightening 
maureen  that s not like you 
you re an optimist 
  always looking at the bright side 
  we ll be home soon   
      and this will all seem like a bad dream 
  that s right 
i suppose that s so 
but i can t shake this feeling
that something s closing in on us 
now  now  maureen  come on  deal  felix 
  sandwiches 
  no  thanks 
no  thank you 
  ed 
  yeah 
  there s a bee in here 
  a bee  don t take any chances 
  maybe he wants the apple 
  then give it to him 
  goddamn  what will i do now 
  don t move 
don t get him mad 
no  charlie 
when are we going to stop this massacre 
  our first airdrop is in half an hour 
  i ve seen what you plan to drop 
those damn poison pellets
won t get us anywhere 
those are my damn poison pellets 
and they ll work 
i m counting on them working 
or we fall back to almost impossible odds 
my coming up with a mass antidote 
which might never be perfected 
thank you  gentlemen  for your support 
but  captain   
   feed this into the computer 
african bees attack a train   
   70 miles northwest of houston 
now  give me a revised time fix  please 
i know how you feel 
especially due to what just happened   
   but right now we are ready
to drop millions of lethal pellets   
   without harming either the population
or the plant life 
  i ll support that 
  so will i 
what we need   
   is every helicopter you have 
all right  you ve got them 
revised timetable coming through  sir 
they re not touching the pellets 
they re not touching the pellets 
they seem to sense
it s something that will kill them 
they re brighter than i thought 
they always are 
maybe you should have tried
bourbon and water and got them drunk 
it s all my fault 
i threw firebombs at the swarm 
it s all my fault 
i threw firebombs at the swarm 
you ve got a beautiful six and a half pound
beautiful daughter 
thank you 
i guess it s true what they say   
   that a woman sort of falls in love
with her doctor at this time 
i hope you will feel the same way
tomorrow  and the day after 
and all of the days after 
paul 
tomas 
helena 
why this one 
in the whole damned world  why this boy 
my god  brad 
what good is all that science 
all that equipment at the base 
all those doctors 
what good are you 
i didn t mean that  you know i didn t 
paul was my first case
when i was the town doctor 
he wanted to be an archaeologist 
  he would ve been a terrific one 
  i m sure of it 
you didn t tell me three of the four
survivors at the base had died 
you had other problems 
and you didn t tell me there s a syndrome
of relapse among survivors   
   shortly after they ve been stung 
a fatal relapse 
some do recover 
a small percentage 
but some do 
some 
the odds are better than none 
you ve dropped your poison pellets
and the africans spit at them 
they re moving toward houston
faster than expected 
general  you should know the enemy
is always expected to do the unexpected 
  dr  crane 
  major baker 
let s hear your rundown 
 three steel mills  seven oil refineries   
     two beet sugar plants
and a nuclear power center 
 plus 46 towns  not including houston   
     are now directly
in the path of the africans   
we ll evacuate the towns 
and close the factories 
i ll tell you now  we ll have trouble
with the nuclear power plant 
they won t shut down voluntarily 
millions in the area need the energy 
if we don t shut them down  the bees will 
i ll check with washington 
to try to get a directive 
i know most of the key executives
at that plant 
i fought them in court often enough
on environmental issues 
i ll fly in and try to jawbone
some sense into them 
it might be a lot quicker than washington 
okay  you got it  thank you 
miss 
more bad news 
everything we ve tried has failed 
our last hope is your mass antidote 
how close are you 
i ve tried it on all these rabbits 
it knocks hell out of them 
these are the only two still alive 
i m on the right track 
but i need more time to experiment 
if you can t perfect it  we might
just as well pack it in right away   
   and ship out to new zealand 
what we need is something
that people can self inject   
   if they get stung by an african bee 
and we need it right now 
i get the picture  first thing tomorrow 
i ll try it on a human 
like who 
  we ll come up with volunteers 
  like me 
forget it 
it ll take a few days to convince them
how much we need human guinea pigs 
meanwhile  i m here and i m convinced 
i m not ready for you  yet 
when i am  i ll let you know 
okay 
will you please start eating the food
they serve here 
it has been measured to ensure you get
energy for the long hours you work 
what the hell does a man have to do
to get a beer and a pizza around here 
all a man has to do  walter  is ask 
all my notes are right here  brad 
on the desk next to the recorder 
they contain the exact instructions 
and i mean exact   
   on how to prepare
the antidote i ve developed 
every experiment 
with its individual notes   
   and conclusions 
is documented in this text 
i m going to test the serum on myself 
why 
because you re fool enough
to make me try it on you 
it s my antidote  so it ll be my risk 
first  i m going to inject myself   
   with the same input of venom
i d receive from the stings of six bees 
that s double the amount anybody
has been able to take and survive 
then i ll see if i ll still be able to use
the self injector with my serum   
   or whether muscular stiffness
will make it impossible 
i ll dictate the rest of this
to the other recorder 
i m all ready 
physiograph is recording 
everything is laid out 
the weal is rising instantly 
now  from the moment of being stung 
a frightened victim   
   medically inexperienced 
would need about 60 seconds   
   to get the self injector
from pocket or purse   
   pull up a sleeve  waste seconds
hesitating  afraid of the needle 
finally  put it in  i m going to give myself
the same 60 seconds 
heartbeat rising rapidly 
heartbeat now 140 
the antidote is on the table in front of me 
fifty five seconds
since i administered the venom 
i m gonna start reaching for it 
it won t move 
my arm feels like it s strapped to my side 
heartbeat   
   160 
close to outer limit 
dropping now 
good 
good 
140 
130 
going to normal 
120 
dropping now 
dr  krim  what are you doing 
you missed the tough part 
how much did you take 
  about six stings  worth 
  oh  dr  krim 
respiration still high   
   but not abnormally so 
let s see now 
i administered the antidote about   
   66 seconds
after the venom was injected 
the antidote works 
  my god  it works 
  dr  krim 
now here s something 
the four physiological responses   
   are swinging from norm to some really   
   spooky levels 
they don t want to stay down 
in fact  they re turning bad 
all of them 
heart rate  rising again 
130 
140 
150 
oh  my god 
losing   
   respiration 
first sign  respiratory arrest 
doctor 
walter 
oh  walter 
there it is 
  i just don t understand your request 
  you will 
have you any idea of the consequences
if i ask washington to shut down 
  less disastrous than not shutting down 
  look at all this 
don t you realize we supply power
over a 500 mile area   
   and purify the drinking water
of 7 million people 
i realize that  i don t think
you realize how critical this is 
there s nothing here
that could attract those bees 
don t be so sure 
the infrared rays could act like a beacon 
no  doctor  see this 
billions of dollars have been spent
to make these nuclear plants fail safe 
the odds against anything going wrong
are astronomical 
i appreciate that  but let me ask you   
   in all your fail safe techniques 
is there a provision against killer bees 
andrews here  come in  control 
control  this is andrews 
what s happening 
control  go to manual 
  the bees  let s get out of here 
  no  this way 
crane 
crane 
i ve been authorized by the president
to close down your operation 
from now on  the war against the africans
will be under military direction   
   the way it should ve been from the first 
  what s the eta now 
  general 
i ll say this for you  crane  you tried 
in spite of what you might think 
i kind of hoped you d pull it off 
arrange protective crating for the two
oscilloscopes  i ll fly them to houston 
  i ll see you there with the equipment 
  i ll be there 
i haven t surrendered yet  general 
   estimating that 600 000 people have
already been evacuated from houston 
elsewhere in the nation 
people stayed indoors or went to church 
between their prayers
they watched the weather 
there was good news for most
of the country other than texas   
   temperatures continued plunging
and cold air   
   coming down with an alaskan front   
   is keeping the africans
confined to texas 
this is frank blair reporting 
who would ve thought bees would be
the first alien force to invade america 
  where are you going 
  air force headquarters 
  go right ahead 
  thank you 
now  without the president s authority 
how can you possibly help 
the least i can do is try 
general 
hello  crane 
  doctor 
  general 
i m really glad you re here for the finale 
is there anything i can do to help 
i m not sure  but come with me 
  very impressive 
  tomorrow there ll be no more africans   
      at least not in houston 
  you ve really found a way to stop them 
i hope so  if we do it here 
we can do it anywhere 
this is a dress rehearsal  to set procedure
for any future african challenges 
this is houston computerized 
and this is houston 
you see  the bees have formed
almost a complete circle  billions of them 
  that s what we ve been waiting for 
  waiting for what 
the battle plan is to get them all
into one area and then zap them 
take a look over here 
  captain  doctor 
  major 
you planned your arrival perfectly 
here they come 
freeze it 
  prepare to use the neutracide 
  neutracide 
use that and nothing will grow
there for 10 years 
why worry about shaving when someone s
about to cut your head off   go 
leader one to all aircraft 
deliver your cargo on target  now 
  they re coming through 
  they have learned to live with it 
i was afraid of this 
they ve become immune to any pesticide 
the occupation of houston has begun   
   and gen  slater
is the first officer in history   
   to get his butt kicked by a mess of bugs 
you got any of that birdseed left 
as i said before  they re high in potassium 
low in sodium 
and as i said before  terrific 
how long can they live in the city 
if they get food and water  they might
just decide to stay here forever 
the defense department in washington
dc has just confirmed the tragic news 
with the approval of the white house 
and as a last resort   
   the city of houston will suffer massive
man made burning before daybreak 
this decision was reached
in accord with all opinions   
   from the armed forces and scientists
involved in the overwhelming   
   but fruitless countermeasures
being attempted   
   to destroy the african killer bee which
has brought the southwest to a standstill 
the burnout is scheduled
to be handled within minutes 
light them up 
move out 
burn them out 
listen to them 
they re still out there 
billions of them  it s as if it s their city 
even though slater s been at it
for 24 hours with every soldier he can get 
you talk about the bees
as if you admire them 
i do  they never fail to astonish me 
it s as though a broad range
of contingencies   
   has been planned for by the creator
and programmed into them   
   for an endless future 
making them the true inheritors
of the earth 
a world without people 
maybe the creator
was equally obliging toward us   
   and programmed into us
the ability to beat them 
i wish he d give us a clue 
here  let me 
right there  that s lovely 
this is better than eight hours of sleep 
how would you know 
you haven t had that in weeks 
listen 
  what is it 
  the bees 
why are they making that sound 
that s the hunger tone 
it causes them to mass together   
   as if by community they can destroy
their enemy  cold  hunger  anything 
i wonder if there is another sound
that s part of their ritual   
helena  helena  are you all right  love 
helena  what s the matter 
darling 
i don t know what else we can do 
i m very sorry 
please  god  let her live 
sir  can we really count
on a scientist who prays 
i wouldn t count on one who doesn t 
  you can forget the dossier 
  yes  sir 
street fighter to topkick 
come in topkick  come in 
topkick  can you read me 
you two  come here 
i can t get through 
too much interference  damn bees 
listen  get back to headquarters 
tell slater we need reinforcements  go 
you wonder  don t you 
houston on fire 
will history blame me or the bees 
  my compliments  general 
  on what  for god s sake 
on being able to maintain
a long term historical perspective 
crane  at this point
there s no other viable perspective 
  our time is up 
  not quite  general 
we re ready with a final experiment 
please don t give up 
  okay 
  thank you 
we ll do another half dozen of these 
get some sleep and start after lunch 
okay 
what s this  we ve not heard this before 
look at this  doctor 
something s coming  here we go 
we ve done it 
  i don t believe this 
  yes  we have 
general  we ve done it 
look  we ve got a match 
understand  we ve discovered
two identical sound patterns 
no  i don t understand 
what has that to do with killing bees 
what you are hearing is the african bee s
mating sound  but listen 
this was made by the alarm system  not
the bees  but they sound exactly alike 
the alarm system at the missile base
drew them in 
the similarity confused them 
when it stopped  they left 
i still don t understand 
the sonic alarm system happens to be
an exact duplicate of the duet   
   between the queen bee
and the young queen bee challenging her 
  but bees can t hear 
  that s right  they go by vibration 
the alarm felt like the vibration
of a ritual they had to attend 
then you re saying our alarm system
attracted the bees into the complex 
right  we ll use this very sound
to pull them out of houston 
okay  i m convinced 
kill the bees  don t hit the man 
no  get it up 
general  general 
  what is going on 
  the bees are inside 
now what 
  you two get going 
  not without helena 
we ll take care of her  use that new
weapon you ve come up with  go 
slater  dodge airfield  code 7  fast 
  general 
  get out 
i m going to get helena 
if i don t make it  you know what to do 
major 
no time for that  let s go 
put this around you  drop them 
  newman 
  go  brad  go 
move out 
general 
dr  crane  this is dodge field 
air tower number two 
we read gen  slater s instructions
loud and clear 
we re prepared to assist in every
possible way  come in  dr  crane 
  do you read me 
  affirmative 
load the choppers with the sound horns 
spread the oil slick  acknowledge 
  roger 
  out  let s go 
to all air force tankers 
spread your oil over the gulf of mexico 
four minutes to flaming 
  ready when you are 
  fine 
  is this all right here 
  is there one on the other side 
  yes  sir 
  please hurry 
won t the noise of the helicopter
drown out your sound 
no  it s an entirely different sonic level 
all set  sir 
rescue five to alpha one 
come in  please 
ditch sound floats 
rescue five to alpha two  come in 
rescue five to alpha three 
pilot  get us to the firing point
as quickly as you can 
here they come 
operation sonic drop complete 
all aircraft clear of target 
okay  thank you 
fire it now 
fire one  fire two  fire three 
fire four  fire five 
did we finally beat them 
or is this just a temporary victory 
i don t know 
but we did gain time  if we use it wisely
