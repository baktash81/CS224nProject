i know a lot about you
who are you
my name is trinity
trinity
the trinity
that cracked the irs dbase
that was a long time ago
jesus
what
i just thought
you were a guy
most guys do
that was you on my computer
how did you do that
right now all i can tell you
is that youre in danger
trinity i brought you here to warn you
of what
theyre watching you neo
who is
please just listen
i know why youre here neo
i know what youve been doing
i know why you hardly sleep
why you live alone and why
night after night
you sit at your computer
youre looking for him
i know because i was once
looking for the same thing
and when he found me
he told me i wasnt really
looking for him
i was looking for an answer
its the question that drives us neo
its the question
that brought you here
you know the question
just as i did
what is the matrix
the answer is out there neo
its looking for you
and it will find you
if you want it to
alarm buzzes
shit
shit shit
you have a problem with authority
mr anderson
you believe that you are special
that the rules do not apply to you
obviously you are mistaken
this is one of the top
software companies in the world
because employees understand
they are part of a whole
thus if an employee has a problem
the company has a problem
the time has come to make
a choice mr anderson
either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth
or you choose to find another job
do i make myself clear
yes mr rhineheart
perfectly clear
messenger
thomas anderson
yeah thats me
messenger
okay
messenger
great
have a nice day
phone rings
hello
morpheus
hello neo do you know who this is
morpheus
yes
ive been looking for you
i dont know if youre ready to see
what i want to show you
but unfortunately you and i
have run out of time
theyre coming for you and i dont know
what theyre going to do
whos coming for me
stand up and see for yourself
what right now
yes now
do it slowly
the elevator
oh shit
yes
what do they want
i dont know if you dont want
to find out get out of there
how
i can guide you
but you must do exactly as i say
okay
the cubicle across from you is empty
but what if they
go now
stay here for just a moment
when i tell you
go to the end of the row
to the office
at the end of the hall
stay as low as you can
go now
good now outside
there is a scaffold
how do you know this
we dont have time
to your left theres a window
go to it
open it
take the scaffold to the roof
no way no way
this is crazy
there are two ways
out of this building
one is that scaffold
the other is in their custody
you take a chance either way
i leave it to you
this is insane
why is this happening to me
whatd i do
im nobody
i didnt do anything
im gonna die
shit
oh shit
i cant do this
shit
as you can see weve had our eye on
you for some time now mr anderson
it seems that youve been living
two lives
in one life
youre thomas a anderson
program writer for
a respectable software company
you have a social security number
you pay your taxes
and you
help your landlady
carry out her garbage
the other life is lived in computers
where you go by
the hacker alias neo
and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for
one of these lives
has a future
and one of them does not
im going to be as forthcoming
as i can be mr anderson
youre here
because we need your help
we know that youve been contacted
by a certain
individual
a man who calls himself morpheus
whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant
he is considered by many authorities
to be the most dangerous man alive
my colleagues
believe that i am wasting
my time with you
but i believe you wish
to do the right thing
were willing to wipe the slate clean
give you a fresh start
all were asking in return
is your cooperation
in bringing
a known terrorist to justice
yeah
that sounds like a really good deal
but i got a better one
how about
i give you the finger
and you give me my phone call
mr anderson
you disappoint me
you cant scare me
with this gestapo crap
i know my rights
i want my phone call
tell me mr anderson
what good is a phone call
if youre unable to speak
youre going to help us
mr anderson
whether you want to or not
phone rings
morpheus this line is tapped
so i must be brief
they got to you first but theyve
underestimated how important you are
if they knew what i know
you would probably be dead
what are you talking about
what is happening to me
you are the one neo you may have
spent the last few years
looking for me but ive spent
my entire life
looking for you
now do you still want to meet
yes
then go to the adams street bridge
get in
whats this
its necessary neo
for our protection
from what
from you
take off your shirt
what
stop the car
listen coppertop
we dont have time for 20 questions
right now theres only one rule
our way
or the highway
fine
please neo you have to trust me
why
because you have been down there
you know that road
you know exactly where it ends
and i know thats
not where you want to be
apoc lights
trinity lie back
lift up your shirt
whats that
youre bugged
try and relax
come on
come on
its on the move
come on you shit
youre gonna lose it
no im not
clear
jesus christ
that things real
this is it
let me give you one piece of advice
be honest
he knows more than you can imagine
at last
welcome neo
as you no doubt have guessed
i am morpheus
its an honor to meet you
no
the honor is mine
please come sit
i imagine
that right now youre feeling
a bit like alice
tumbling down the rabbit hole
you could say that
i can see it in your eyes
you have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees
because hes expecting to wake up
ironically this is not
far from the truth
do you believe in fate neo
no
why not
i dont like the idea that
im not in control of my life
i know exactly what you mean
let me tell you why youre here
you know something
what you know
you cant explain
but you feel it
you felt it your entire life
somethings wrong with the world
you dont know what but its there
like a splinter in your mind
driving you mad
it is this feeling
that has brought you to me
do you know what
im talking about
the matrix
do you want to know
what it is
the matrix is everywhere
it is all around us
even now in this very room
you can see it when you
look out your window
or when you turn on your television
you can feel it when you go to work
when you go to church
when you pay your taxes
it is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes
to blind you from the truth
what truth
that you are a slave
like everyone else
you were born into bondage
born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch
a prison
for your mind
unfortunately no one can be
told what the matrix is
you have to see it for yourself
this is your last chance
after this there is no turning back
you take the blue pill
the story ends you wake up
in your bed and believe
whatever you want to believe
you take the red pill
you stay in wonderland
and i show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes
remember
all im offering is the truth
nothing more
follow me
apoc are we online
apoc
almost
morpheus
time is always against us
please take a seat there
you did all this
trinity mmhm
the pill you took is
part of a trace program
it disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location
what does that mean
it means buckle your
seat belt dorothy
because kansas
is going byebye
did you
have you ever had a dream neo
that you were so sure was real
what if you were unable
to wake from that dream
how would you know the difference
between the dream world
and the real world
neo
this cant be
morpheus
be what
be real
going into replication
apoc
still nothing
neo
its cold
its cold
tank well need a signal soon
i got a fibrillation
apoc location
apoc
targeting almost there
hes going into arrest
lock i got him
now tank now
welcome
to the real world
morpheus
weve done it trinity
we found him
i hope youre right
morpheus i dont have to hope
i know it
am i dead
far from it
he still needs a lot of work
what are you doing
your muscles atrophied
were rebuilding them
ww do my eyes hurt
youve never used them before
rest neo
the answers are coming
door opens
morpheus whats happened to me
what is this place
more important than what is when
when
you believe its the year 1999
when in fact its closer to 2199
i cant tell you exactly
what year it is
because we honestly dont know
theres nothing i can say
that will explain it for you
come with me
see for yourself
morpheus
this is my ship
the nebuchadnezzar
its a hovercraft
this is the main deck
this is the core
where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the matrix
most of my crew you already know
this is apoc
switch
and cypher
hi
the ones you dont know
tank and his big brother dozer
the little one behind you is mouse
you wanted to know
what the matrix is
trinity
try to relax
this will feel a little weird
this
is the construct
its our loading program
we can load anything from clothing
to equipment
weapons
training simulations
anything we need
neo right now were inside
a computer program
is it really so hard to believe
your clothes are different
the plugs in your body are gone
your hair has changed
your appearance now is what we call
residual selfimage
it is the mental projection
of your digital self
this isnt real
what is real
how do you define real
if youre talking about
what you can feel
what you can smell taste and see
then real is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain
this is the world that you know
the world as it was at the end
of the 20th century
it exists now only as part of
a neuralinteractive simulation
that we call the matrix
youve been living
in a dream world neo
this is the world
as it exists today
welcome to the desert
of the real
we have only bits and pieces
of information
but what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century
all of mankind was united
in celebration
we marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to al
ai
you mean artificial intelligence
a singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines
we dont know who struck first
us or them
but we know that it was us
that scorched the sky
they were dependent on solar power
and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive
without an energy source
as abundant as the sun
throughout human history we have
been dependent on machines to survive
fate it seems is not
without a sense of irony
the human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120volt battery
and over 25000 btus of body heat
combined with a form of fusion
the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need
there are fields neo
endless fields
where human beings
are no longer born
we are grown
for the longest time
i wouldnt believe it
and then i saw the fields
with my own eyes
watched them liquefy the dead
so they could be fed intravenously
to the living
and standing there
facing the pure horrifying precision
i came to realize
the obviousness of the truth
what is the matrix
control
the matrix is a computergenerated
dream world
built to keep us under control
in order to change a human being
into this
no
i dont believe it
its not possible
i didnt say it would be easy neo
i just said it would be the truth
stop
let me out
let me out i want out
easy neo easy
get this thing out of me
get this thing out of me
dont touch me
stay away from me
i dont believe it
i dont believe it
i dont believe it
hes gonna pop
breathe neo
just breathe
i cant go back can i
no
but if you could
would you really want to
i owe you an apology
we have a rule
we never free a mind
once its reached a certain age
its dangerous
the mind has trouble letting go
ive seen it before and im sorry
i did what i did because
i had to
when the matrix was first built
there was a man born inside
who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted
to remake the matrix as he saw fit
it was he who freed the first of us
taught us the truth
as long as the matrix exists
the human race will never be free
after he died
the oracle prophesied his return
and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the matrix
end the war
bring freedom to our people
that is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the matrix
looking for him
i did what i did because
i believe that search is over
get some rest
youre going to need it
for what
your training
morning did you sleep
you will tonight
i guarantee it
im tank ill be your operator
you dont have any
holes nope
me and my brother dozer are 100
pure oldfashioned homegrown human
born free right here
in the real world
genuine child of zion
zion
if the war was over tomorrow
zions where the party would be
its a city
the last human city
the only place we have left
where is it
deep underground near the earths core
where its still warm
you live long enough
you might see it
goddamn i gotta tell you im excited
to see what youre capable of
if morpheus is right and all
were not supposed to
talk about this but
if you are
its a very exciting time
we got a lot to do
we gotta get to it
were supposed to start
with these programs first
thats major boring shit
lets do something more fun
how about
combat training
jujitsu
im going to learn jujitsu
holy shit
hey mikey i think he likes it
how about some more
hell yes
hell yeah
how is he
ten hours straight
hes a machine
i know kung fu
show me
this is a sparring program
similar to the programmed reality
of the matrix
it has the same basic rules
like gravity
these rules are no different
than those of a computer system
some of them can be bent
others can be broken
understand
then hit me
if you can
good
adaptation
improvisation
but your weakness
is not your technique
morpheus is fighting neo
how did i beat you
youre too fast
do you believe that
my being stronger or faster
has anything to do
with my muscles in this place
you think youre breathing air
again
jesus christ hes fast
his neurokinetics
are way above normal
what are you waiting for
youre faster than this
dont think you are
know you are
come on stop trying to hit me
and hit me
i dont believe it
i know what youre trying to do
im trying to free your mind neo
but i can only show you the door
you have to walk through it
tank load the jump program
you have to let it all go neo
feat
doubt and disbelief
free your mind
whoa
okeydokey
free my mind
what if he makes it
no ones ever made their first jump
mouse i know
but what if he does
he wont
come on
all right
no problem free my mind
free my mind no problem right
what does that mean
it doesnt mean anything
everybody falls the first time
right trin
i thought it wasnt real
your mind makes it real
if youre killed in the matrix
you die here
the body cannot live without the mind
i dont remember you ever
bringing me dinner
there is something about him
isnt there
youre a believer now
i keep wondering
if morpheus is so sure
why not take him to see the oracle
morpheus will take him
when hes ready
the matrix is a system neo
that system is our enemy
but when youre inside
what do you see
businessmen teachers
lawyers carpenters
the very minds of the people
we are trying to save
but until we do these people are
a part of that system
and that makes them our enemy
you have to understand
most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged
and many of them are so inert
so hopelessly dependent
on the system
that they will fight to protect it
were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress
i was
look again
freeze it
neo this isnt the matrix
morpheus no
its another training program
designed to teach you one thing
if you are not one of us
you are one of them
what are they
sentient programs
they can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system
that means that anyone
we havent unplugged
is potentially an agent
inside the matrix
they are everyone
and they are no one
we have survived by hiding
and running from them
but they are the gatekeepers
theyre guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys
sooner or later someone will
have to fight them
someone
morpheus
i wont lie to you neo
every single man or woman who
has fought an agent has died
but where they have failed
you will succeed
why
morpheus ive seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall
men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air
yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules
because of that
they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be
what are you telling me
that i can dodge bullets
no neo
im trying to tell you
that when youre ready
you wont have to
phone rings
tank
we got trouble
did zion send the warning
no another ship
shit
squiddys sweeping in quick
squiddy
a sentinel a killing machine
designed for one thing
search and destroy
set her down there
how are we doing tank
power offline
emp armed
and ready
emf
electromagnetic pulse
disables any electrical system
in the blast radius
its the only weapon we have
against the machines
neo where are we
their old service and waste systems
sewers
trinity there used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles
now these sewers are
all thats left
quiet
whoa neo
you scared the bejesus out of me
sorry
its okay
is that
the matrix
yeah
do you always look at it encoded
well you have to
the image translators work
for the construct program
but theres way too much information
to decode the matrix
you get used to it
i dont even see the code
all i see is blonde brunette redhead
do you
want a drink
sure
you know
i know what youre thinking
because right now im thinking
the same thing
actually ive been thinking it
ever since i got here
why oh why didnt i take
the blue pill
coughs
good shit huh
dozer makes it
its good for two things
degreasing engines and
killing brain cells
so can i ask you something
did he tell you why he did it
why youre here
jesus
what a mind job
so youre here to save the world
what do you say
to something like that
a little piece of advice
you see an agent
you do what we do
run
you run your ass off
thanks for the drink
sweet dreams
smith
do we have a deal mr reagan
you know
i know this steak doesnt exist
i know that when i put it
in my mouth
the matrix is telling my brain
that it is
juicy
and delicious
after nine years
you know what i realize
ignorance is bliss
then we have a deal
i dont want to remember nothing
nothing you understand
and i want to be rich
you know someone important
like an actor
whatever you want mr reagan
okay
you get my body
back in a power plant
reinsert me into the matrix
ill get you what you want
access codes to the zion mainframe
no i told you i dont know them
i can get you the man who does
morpheus
here you go buddy
breakfast of champions
close your eyes it feels
like youre eating runny eggs
or a bowl of snot
mouse
you know what it reminds me of
tastee wheat did you
ever eat tastee wheat
no but technically
neither did you
thats exactly my point exactly
because you have to wonder
how do the machines really know
what tastee wheat tasted like
maybe they got it wrong
maybe what i think tastee wheat
tasted like actually tasted like
oatmeal or tuna fish
that makes you wonder
take chicken for example
maybe they didnt know
what to make it taste like
which is why it tastes
like everything
and maybe they
shut up
dozer
its a singlecelled protein
combined with synthetic aminos
vitamins and minerals
everything the body needs
it doesnt have everything
the body needs
i understand youve run through
the agent training program
you know i wrote that program
here it comes
mouse what did you think of her
neo of who
the woman in the red dress
i designed her
she doesnt talk very much
but if youd like to meet her
i can arrange a more personal milieu
the digital pimp hard at work
pay no attention to
these hypocrites neo
to deny our own impulses
is to deny the very thing
that makes us human
dozer when youre done
bring the ship up to broadcast depth
were going in
im taking neo to see her
see who
the oracle
everyone please observe
the fasten seat belt
and no smoking signs are on
sit back and enjoy your flight
phone rings
were in
well be back in an hour
phone dials then rings
morpheus
unbelievable
isnt it
neo god
what
i used to eat there
really good noodles
i have these memories from my life
none of them happened
what does that mean
that the matrix cannot tell you
who you are
but an oracle can
thats different
did you go to her
trinity
yes
what did she tell you
she told me
what
morpheus
were here
neo come with me
so is this the same oracle
that made
the prophecy
yes shes very old shes been
with us since the beginning
neo the beginning
of the resistance
and she knows what everything
she would say she knows enough
and shes never wrong
morpheus try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong
she is a guide neo
she can help you to find the path
she helped you
yes
what did she tell you
that i would find the one
i told you i can only
show you the door
you have to walk through it
hello neo
youre right on time
make yourself at home morpheus
neo come with me
these are the other potentials
you can wait here
boy
do not try and bend the spoon
thats impossible
instead only try
to realize the truth
what truth
there is no spoon
there is no spoon
then youll see that it is not the spoon
that bends it is only yourself
the oracle will you see now
oracle
i know youre neo
be right with you
youre the oracle
bingo
not quite what you
were expecting right
almost done
smell good dont they
yeah
oracle
id ask you to sit down
but youre not going to anyway
and dont worry about the vase
what vase
thatvase
im sorry
i said dont worry about it
ill get one of my kids to fix it
how did you know
whats really going to bake
your noodle later on is
would you still have broken it
if i hadnt said anything
youre cuter than i thought
i can see why she likes you
who
not too bright though
you know why morpheus
brought you to see me
so
what do you think
do you think you are the one
i dont know
you know what that means
its latin
means know thyself
ill let you in on a little secret
being the one is just
like being in love
no one can tell you youre in love
you just know it
through and through
balls to bones
well
id better have a look at you
open your mouth say ah
qkay
now im supposed to say
hmm thats interesting but
then you say
but what
but you already know
what im going to tell you
im not the one
sorry kid
you got the gift
but it looks like
youre waiting for something
what
your next life maybe who knows
thats the way these things go
whats funny
morpheus
he almost had me convinced
i know
poor morpheus
without him were lost
what do you mean without him
are you sure you want
to hear this
morpheus believes in you neo
and no one not you not even me
can convince him otherwise
he believes it so blindly
that hes going to sacrifice
his life to save yours
what
oracle youre going to
have to make a choice
in the one hand
youll have morpheus life
and in the other hand
youll have your own
one of you is going to die
which one will be up to you
im sorry kiddo i really am
you have a good soul
and i hate giving
good people bad news
dont worry about it
as soon as you
step outside that door
youll start feeling better
youll remember you dont believe
in any of this fate crap
youre in control of your own life
remember
here
take a cookie
i promise by the time
youre done eating it

cypher
hello trinity
cypher wheres tank
you know
for a long time
i thought i was in love with you
i used to dream about you
youre a beautiful woman trinity
too bad things had to
turn out this way
you killed them
what
oh god
im tired trinity
im tired of this war
tired of fighting
im tired of this ship
of being cold of eating
the same goddamn goop every day
but most of all
im tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit
surprise asshole
i bet you never saw this coming
did you
god i wish i could be there
when they break you
i wish i could walk in
just when it happens
so right then
youd know it was me
you gave them morpheus
he lied to us trinity
he tricked us
if you had told us the truth
we wouldve told you to shove
that red pill up your ass
that is not true cypher
he set us free
free you call this free
all i do is what he tells me to do
if i had to choose between
that and the matrix
i choose the matrix
the matrix isnt real
i disagree trinity
i think the matrix
can be more real than this world
all i do is pull the plug here
but there
you have to watch apoc die
trinity
welcome to the real world
but youre out cypher
you cant go back
thats what you think
theyll reinsert my body
i go back to sleep when i wake up
i wont remember a thing
by the way
if you have anything important
to say to switch
say it now
no please dont
not like this
not like this
too late
goddamn you cypher
dont hate me trinity
im just a messenger
and right now
im going to prove it to you
if morpheus was right
theres no way
i can pull this plug
if neos the one
then there d have to be
some kind of a miracle to stop me
right
i mean how can he be the one
if hes dead
you never did answer me before
if you bought into
morpheus bullshit
come on all i want
is a little yes or no
look into his eyes
those big pretty eyes
and tell me
yes
oi i70
yes
no
i dont believe it
believe it or not you piece of shit
youre still going to burn
phone rings
you first
youre hurt
ill be all right
doze r
smith
have you ever stood and stared at it
marveled at its beauty
its genius
billions of people
just living out their lives
oblivious
did you know that the first matrix
was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered
where everyone would be happy
it was a disaster
no one would accept the program
entire crops were lost
some believe that
we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world
but i believe that
as a species
human beings define
their reality through misery
and suffering
so the perfect world was a dream
that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from
which is why the matrix was
redesigned to this
the peak
of your civilization
i say your civilization
because when we started thinking
for you it became our civilization
which is of course
what this is all about
evolution morpheus
evolution
like the dinosaur
look out that window
you had your time
the future is our world morpheus
the future is our time
there could be a problem
neo what are they doing to him
theyre breaking into his mind
its like hacking a computer
all it takes is time
how much time
depends on the mind
but eventually itll crack
and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this
when it does hell tell them
anything they want to know
what do they want
the leader of every ship is given
codes to zions mainframe computer
if an agent got the codes
and got into zions mainframe
they could destroy us
we cant let that happen
trinity zions more important than me
or you
or even morpheus
there has to be
something we can do
there is we pull the plug
youre going to kill him
kill morpheus
we dont have a choice
never send a human
to do a machines job
if the insider has failed
theyll sever the connection
as soon as possible unless
theyre dead in either case
we have no choice continue as planned
deploy the sentinels
immediately
morpheus you were more
than a leader to us
you were a father
well miss you always
stop
i dont believe this is happening
neo this has to be done
neo does it
i dont know
this cant be just coincidence
what
neo
the oracle
she told me this would happen
she told me that i would
have to make a choice
what choice
what are you doing
im going in
trinity no youre not
i have to
neo morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out
there is no way
that youre going back in
morpheus did what he did because
he believed im something im not
what
im not the one trinity
the oracle hit me with that too
no you have to be
im sorry im not
im just another guy
no neo thats not true
it cant be true
why
this is loco theyve got morpheus
in a militarycontrolled building
even if you somehow got inside those
are agents holding him three of them
i want morpheus back too but
what youre talking about is suicide
thats what it looks like
but its not
i cant explain to you why its not
morpheus believed something and
he was ready to give his life for it
i understand that now
thats why i have to go
why
because i believe in something
what
i believe i can bring him back
what are you doing
going with you
no youre not
_iinoii
let me tell you what i believe
morpheus means more to me
than he does to you
i believe if you are serious about
saving him you will need my help
and since i am the ranking officer
if you dont like it
i believe you can go to hell
because you arent going anywhere else
tank
load us up
id like to share
a revelation that ive had
during my time here
it came to me when i tried
to classify your species
and i realized
that youre not actually mammals
every mammal on this planet
instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment
but you humans do not
you move to an area
and you multiply
and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed
the only way you can survive
is to spread to another area
there is another organism
on this planet
that follows the same pattern
do you know what it is
a virus
human beings are a disease
a cancer of this planet
you are a plague
and we
are the cure
okay so what do you need
besides a miracle
guns
lots of guns
neo
no one has ever done
anything like this
thats why its going to work
why isnt the serum working
perhaps were asking
the wrong questions
leave me with him
now
tank
hold on morpheus
theyre coming for you
theyre coming
smith
can you hear me morpheus
im going to be honest
with you
l
hate
this place
this zoo
this prison
this reality
whatever you want to call it
i cant stand it any longer
its the smell
if there is such a thing
i feel saturated by it
i can
taste
your stink
and every time i do i fear that
i have somehow been infected by it
its repulsive
isnt it
i must get out of here
i must get free
and in this mind is the key
my key
once zion is destroyed
there is no need for me to be here
do you understand
i need the codes
i have to get inside zion
and you have to tell me how
youre going to tell me
or youre going to die
please remove any metallic items
youre carrying keys loose change
holy shit
backup send backup
freeze
what were you doing
he doesnt know
know what
i think theyre trying to save him
there is no spoon
find them and destroy them
were under attack
trinity
help
only human
dodge this
how did you do that
do what
you moved like they do
ive never seen anyone move that fast
it wasnt fast enough
