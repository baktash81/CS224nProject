hello  neo 
how do you know that name 
i know a lot about you 
  who are you 
  my name is trinity 
trinity 
the trinity 
that cracked the irs d base 
that was a long time ago 
  jesus 
  what 
i just thought   
   you were a guy 
most guys do 
that was you on my computer 
how did you do that 
right now  all i can tell you   
   is that you re in danger 
trinity  i brought you here to warn you 
  of what 
they re watching you  neo 
  who is 
  please just listen 
i know why you re here  neo 
i know what you ve been doing 
i know why you hardly sleep   
   why you live alone and why 
night after night   
   you sit at your computer 
you re looking for him 
i know  because i was once
looking for the same thing 
and when he found me   
   he told me i wasn t really
looking for him   
   i was looking for an answer 
it s the question that drives us  neo 
it s the question
that brought you here 
you know the question   
   just as i did 
what is the matrix 
the answer is out there  neo 
it s looking for you 
and it will find you   
   if you want it to 
 alarm buzzes 
shit 
shit  shit 
you have a problem with authority 
mr  anderson 
you believe that you are special 
that the rules do not apply to you 
obviously  you are mistaken 
this is one of the top
software companies in the world   
   because employees understand
they are part of a whole 
thus  if an employee has a problem 
the company has a problem 
the time has come to make
a choice  mr  anderson 
either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth   
or you choose to find another job 
do i make myself clear 
yes  mr  rhineheart 
perfectly clear 
messenger 
thomas anderson 
yeah  that s me 
messenger 
okay 
messenger 
great 
have a nice day 
 phone rings 
hello 
morpheus 
hello  neo  do you know who this is 
  morpheus 
  yes 
i ve been looking for you 
i don t know if you re ready to see
what i want to show you 
but unfortunately  you and i
have run out of time 
they re coming for you  and i don t know
what they re going to do 
who s coming for me 
stand up and see for yourself 
what  right now 
yes  now 
do it slowly 
the elevator 
  oh  shit 
  yes 
what do they want 
i don t know  if you don t want
to find out  get out of there 
how 
i can guide you 
but you must do exactly as i say 
  okay 
  the cubicle across from you is empty 
  but what if they  
  go  now 
stay here for just a moment 
when i tell you 
go to the end of the row   
   to the office
at the end of the hall 
stay as low as you can 
go  now 
good  now  outside
there is a scaffold 
  how do you know this 
  we don t have time 
to your left there s a window 
go to it 
open it 
take the scaffold to the roof 
no way  no way 
this is crazy 
there are two ways
out of this building 
one is that scaffold 
the other is in their custody 
you take a chance either way 
i leave it to you 
this is insane 
why is this happening to me  
wha t d i do 
i m nobody 
i didn t do anything 
i m gonna die 
shit 
oh  shit 
i can t do this 
shit 
as you can see  we ve had our eye on
you for some time now  mr  anderson 
it seems that you ve been living   
   two lives 
in one life 
you re thomas a  anderson   
   program writer for
a respectable software company 
you have a social security number 
you pay your taxes 
and you   
   help your landlady
carry out her garbage 
the other life is lived in computers   
   where you go by
the hacker alias  neo    
   and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for 
one of these lives   
   has a future 
and one of them does not 
i m going to be as forthcoming
as i can be  mr  anderson 
you re here   
   because we need your help 
we know that you ve been contacted
by a certain   
   individual 
a man who calls himself  morpheus  
whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant 
he is considered by many authorities   
   to be the most dangerous man alive 
my colleagues   
   believe that i am wasting
my time with you 
but i believe you wish
to do the right thing 
we re willing to wipe the slate clean   
   give you a fresh start 
all we re asking in return
is your cooperation   
   in bringing
a known terrorist to justice 
yeah 
that sounds like a really good deal 
but i got a better one 
how about   
   i give you the finger   
   and you give me my phone call 
mr  anderson   
   you disappoint me 
you can t scare me
with this gestapo crap 
i know my rights 
i want my phone call 
tell me  mr  anderson   
   what good is a phone call   
   if you re unable to speak 
you re going to help us 
mr  anderson   
   whether you want to or not 
 phone rings 
morpheus  this line is tapped 
so i must be brief 
they got to you first  but they ve
underestimated how important you are 
if they knew what i know   
you would probably be dead 
what are you talking about 
what is happening to me 
you are the one  neo  you may have
spent the last few years   
   looking for me  but i ve spent
my entire life   
   looking for you 
now  do you still want to meet 
  yes 
  then go to the adams street bridge 
get in 
what s this 
it s necessary  neo 
for our protection 
  from what 
  from you 
  take off your shirt 
  what 
stop the car 
listen  coppertop 
we don t have time for 20 questions 
right now  there s only one rule 
our way   
   or the highway 
fine 
please  neo  you have to trust me 
  why 
  because you have been down there 
you know that road 
you know exactly where it ends 
and i know that s
not where you want to be 
apoc  lights 
trinity  lie back 
lift up your shirt 
  what s that 
  you re bugged 
try and relax 
come on 
come on 
it s on the move 
come on  you shit 
  you re gonna lose it 
  no  i m not 
clear 
jesus christ 
that thing s real  
this is it 
let me give you one piece of advice 
be honest 
he knows more than you can imagine 
at last 
welcome  neo 
as you no doubt have guessed   
   i am morpheus 
it s an honor to meet you 
no   
   the honor is mine 
please  come  sit 
i imagine   
   that right now you re feeling
a bit like alice   
   tumbling down the rabbit hole 
you could say that 
i can see it in your eyes 
you have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees   
   because he s expecting to wake up 
ironically  this is not
far from the truth 
do you believe in fate  neo 
no 
why not 
i don t like the idea that
i m not in control of my life 
i know exactly what you mean 
let me tell you why you re here 
you know something 
what you know 
you can t explain 
but you feel it 
you felt it your entire life 
something s wrong with the world 
you don t know what  but it s there 
like a splinter in your mind   
   driving you mad 
it is this feeling
that has brought you to me 
do you know what
i m talking about 
the matrix 
do you want to know   
   what it is 
the matrix is everywhere 
it is all around us 
even now  in this very room 
you can see it when you
look out your window   
   or when you turn on your television 
you can feel it when you go to work   
   when you go to church   
   when you pay your taxes 
it is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes   
   to blind you from the truth 
what truth 
that you are a slave 
like everyone else 
you were born into bondage   
   born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch 
a prison   
   for your mind 
unfortunately  no one can be   
   told what the matrix is 
you have to see it for yourself 
this is your last chance 
after this  there is no turning back 
you take the blue pill   
   the story ends  you wake up
in your bed and believe   
   whatever you want to believe 
you take the red pill   
   you stay in wonderland   
   and i show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes 
remember   
   all i m offering is the truth 
nothing more 
follow me 
apoc  are we on line 
apoc 
almost 
morpheus 
time is always against us 
please take a seat there 
  you did all this 
trinity  mm hm 
the pill you took is
part of a trace program 
it disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location 
what does that mean 
it means buckle your
seat belt  dorothy   
   because kansas   
   is going bye bye 
did you    
have you ever had a dream  neo 
that you were so sure was real 
what if you were unable
to wake from that dream 
how would you know the difference
between the dream world   
   and the real world 
neo 
this can t be 
morpheus 
be what 
be real 
  going into replication 
  apoc 
still nothing 
neo 
it s cold 
it s cold 
tank  we ll need a signal soon 
  i got a fibrillation 
  apoc  location 
apoc 
targeting almost there 
he s going into arrest 
  lock  i got him 
  now  tank  now 
welcome   
   to the real world 
morpheus 
we ve done it  trinity 
we found him 
  i hope you re right 
morpheus  i don t have to hope 
i know it 
am i dead 
far from it 
he still needs a lot of work 
what are you doing 
your muscles atrophied 
we re rebuilding them 
ww do my eyes hurt 
you ve never used them before 
rest  neo 
the answers are coming 
 door opens 
morpheus  what s happened to me 
what is this place 
more important than  what  is  when  
 when  
you believe it s the year 1999   
   when in fact  it s closer to 2199 
i can t tell you exactly
what year it is   
   because we honestly don t know 
there s nothing i can say
that will explain it for you 
come with me 
see for yourself 
morpheus 
this is my ship 
the nebuchadnezzar 
it s a hovercraft 
this is the main deck 
this is the core   
   where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the matrix 
most of my crew you already know 
this is apoc   
   switch   
    and cypher 
  hi 
the ones you don t know 
tank and his big brother  dozer 
the little one behind you is mouse 
you wanted to know
what the matrix is 
trinity 
try to relax 
this will feel a little weird 
this   
   is the construct 
it s our loading program 
we can load anything  from clothing   
   to equipment   
   weapons   
   training simulations   
   anything we need 
neo  right now we re inside
a computer program 
is it really so hard to believe 
your clothes are different 
the plugs in your body are gone 
your hair has changed 
your appearance now is what we call
 residual self image  
it is the mental projection
of your digital self 
this isn t real 
what is  real  
how do you define  real  
if you re talking about
what you can feel   
   what you can smell  taste and see   
   then  real  is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain 
this is the world that you know 
the world as it was at the end
of the 20th century 
it exists now only as part of
a neural interactive simulation   
   that we call the matrix 
you ve been living
in a dream world  neo 
this is the world   
   as it exists today 
welcome to  the desert   
   of the real  
we have only bits and pieces
of information 
but what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century   
   all of mankind was united
in celebration 
we marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to al 
ai 
you mean artificial intelligence 
a singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines 
we don t know who struck first 
us or them 
but we know that it was us
that scorched the sky 
they were dependent on solar power   
   and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive   
   without an energy source
as abundant as the sun 
throughout human history  we have
been dependent on machines to survive 
fate  it seems  is not
without a sense of irony 
the human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120 volt battery 
and over 25 000 btus of body heat 
combined with a form of fusion   
   the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need 
there are fields  neo 
endless fields   
   where human beings
are no longer born 
we are grown 
for the longest time 
i wouldn t believe it 
and then i saw the fields
with my own eyes   
   watched them liquefy the dead   
   so they could be fed intravenously
to the living 
and standing there 
facing the pure  horrifying precision   
   i came to realize
the obviousness of the truth 
what is the matrix 
control 
the matrix is a computer generated
dream world   
   built to keep us under control   
   in order to change a human being   
   into this 
no 
i don t believe it 
it s not possible 
i didn t say it would be easy  neo 
i just said it would be the truth 
s top 
let me out 
let me out  i want out 
  easy  neo  easy 
  get this thing out of me 
get this thing out of me 
don t touch me 
stay away from me 
i don t believe it 
i don t believe it 
i don t believe it 
  he s gonna pop 
  breathe  neo 
just breathe 
i can t go back  can i 
no 
but if you could   
   would you really want to 
i owe you an apology 
we have a rule 
we never free a mind
once it s reached a certain age 
it s dangerous 
the mind has trouble letting go 
i ve seen it before  and i m sorry 
i did what i did because   
   i had to 
when the matrix was first built 
there was a man born inside   
   who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted   
   to remake the matrix as he saw fit 
it was he who freed the first of us   
   taught us the truth 
as long as the matrix exists   
   the human race will never be free 
after he died   
   the oracle prophesied his return   
   and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the matrix   
   end the war   
   bring freedom to our people 
that is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the matrix   
   looking for him 
i did what i did because   
   i believe that search is over 
get some rest 
you re going to need it 
for what 
your training 
morning  did you sleep 
you will tonight 
i guarantee it 
i m tank  i ll be your operator 
  you don t have any  
  holes  nope 
me and my brother  dozer  are 100 
pure  old fashioned  homegrown human 
born free right here   
   in the real world 
genuine child of zion 
  zion 
  if the war was over tomorrow   
   zion s where the party would be 
it s a city 
the last human city 
the only place we have left 
where is it 
deep underground near the earth s core 
where it s still warm 
you live long enough 
you might see it 
goddamn  i gotta tell you  i m excited
to see what you re capable of   
   if morpheus is right and all 
we re not supposed to
talk about this  but   
   if you are   
   it s a very exciting time 
we got a lot to do 
we gotta get to it 
we re supposed to start
with these programs first 
that s major boring shit 
let s do something more fun 
how about   
   combat training 
jujitsu  
i m going to learn jujitsu 
holy shit 
 hey  mikey  i think he likes it  
how about some more 
hell  yes 
hell  yeah 
how is he 
ten hours straight 
he s a machine 
i know kung fu 
show me 
this is a sparring program   
   similar to the programmed reality
of the matrix 
it has the same basic rules 
like gravity 
these rules are no different
than those of a computer system 
some of them can be bent 
others can be broken 
understand 
then hit me   
   if you can 
good 
adaptation 
improvisation 
but your weakness   
   is not your technique 
morpheus is fighting neo 
how did i beat you 
you re too fast 
do you believe that   
   my being stronger or faster   
   has anything to do
with my muscles in this place 
you think you re breathing air 
again 
jesus christ  he s fast 
his neuro kinetics
are way above normal 
what are you waiting for 
you re faster than this 
don t think you are 
know you are 
come on  stop trying to hit me 
and hit me 
i don t believe it 
i know what you re trying to do 
i m trying to free your mind  neo 
but i can only show you the door 
you have to walk through it 
tank  load the jump program 
you have to let it all go  neo
feat 
   doubt and disbelief 
free your mind 
whoa 
okey dokey 
free my mind 
what if he makes it 
  no one s ever made their first jump 
mouse  i know 
  but what if he does 
  he won t 
come on 
all right 
no problem  free my mind 
free my mind  no problem  right 
what does that mean 
it doesn t mean anything 
everybody falls the first time 
right  trin 
  i thought it wasn t real 
  your mind makes it real 
if you re killed in the matrix   
   you die here 
the body cannot live without the mind 
i don t remember you ever
bringing me dinner 
there is something about him 
isn t there 
you re a believer now 
i keep wondering   
   if morpheus is so sure 
why not take him to see the oracle 
morpheus will take him
when he s ready 
the matrix is a system  neo 
that system is our enemy 
but when you re inside 
what do you see 
businessmen  teachers 
lawyers  carpenters 
the very minds of the people
we are trying to save 
but until we do  these people are
a part of that system   
   and that makes them our enemy 
you have to understand   
   most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged 
and many of them are so inert   
   so hopelessly dependent
on the system   
   that they will fight to protect it 
were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress 
  i was  
  look again 
freeze it 
neo  this isn t the matrix 
morpheus  no 
it s another training program
designed to teach you one thing 
if you are not one of us 
you are one of them 
  what are they 
  sentient programs 
they can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system 
that means that anyone
we haven t unplugged   
   is potentially an agent 
inside the matrix   
   they are everyone   
   and they are no one 
we have survived by hiding
and running from them   
   but they are the gatekeepers 
they re guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys 
sooner or later  someone will
have to fight them 
someone 
morpheus 
i won t lie to you  neo 
every single man or woman who
has fought an agent  has died 
but where they have failed 
you will succeed 
why 
morpheus  i ve seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall 
men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air 
yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules 
because of that   
   they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be 
what are you telling me 
that i can dodge bullets 
no  neo 
i m trying to tell you
that when you re ready   
   you won t have to 
 phone rings 
tank 
we got trouble 
  did zion send the warning 
  no  another ship 
shit 
  squiddy s sweeping in quick 
  squiddy 
a sentinel  a killing machine
designed for one thing 
search and destroy 
set her down there 
how are we doing  tank 
power off line 
emp armed   
    and ready
  emf  
electromagnetic pulse 
disables any electrical system
in the blast radius 
it s the only weapon we have
against the machines 
neo  where are we 
  their old service and waste systems 
sewers 
trinity  there used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles 
now these sewers are
all that s left 
quiet 
whoa  neo 
you scared the bejesus out of me 
  sorry 
  it s okay 
is that    
the matrix 
yeah 
  do you always look at it encoded 
  well  you have to 
the image translators work
for the construct program 
but there s way too much information
to decode the matrix 
you get used to it 
i don t even see the code 
all i see is blonde  brunette  redhead 
do you   
   want a drink 
sure 
you know   
   i know what you re thinking 
because right now i m thinking
the same thing 
actually  i ve been thinking it
ever since i got here 
why  oh  why didn t i take
the blue pill 
 coughs 
good shit  huh 
dozer makes it 
it s good for two things 
degreasing engines and
killing brain cells 
so can i ask you something 
did he tell you why he did it  
why you re here 
jesus 
what a mind job 
so you re here to save the world 
what do you say
to something like that 
a little piece of advice 
you see an agent   
   you do what we do 
run 
you run your ass off 
thanks for the drink 
sweet dreams 
smith 
do we have a deal  mr  reagan 
you know   
   i know this steak doesn t exist 
i know that when i put it
in my mouth   
   the matrix is telling my brain
that it is   
   juicy   
   and delicious 
after nine years   
   you know what i realize 
ignorance is bliss 
then we have a deal 
i don t want to remember nothing 
nothing  you understand 
and i want to be rich 
you know  someone important 
like an actor 
whatever you want  mr  reagan 
okay 
you get my body
back in a power plant   
   reinsert me into the matrix   
   i ll get you what you want 
access codes to the zion mainframe 
no  i told you  i don t know them 
i can get you the man who does 
morpheus 
here you go  buddy 
breakfast of champions 
close your eyes  it feels
like you re eating runny eggs 
or a bowl of snot 
mouse 
you know what it reminds me of 
tastee wheat  did you
ever eat tastee wheat 
no  but technically 
neither did you 
that s exactly my point  exactly 
because you have to wonder   
   how do the machines really know
what tastee wheat tasted like 
maybe they got it wrong 
maybe what i think tastee wheat
tasted like  actually tasted like   
   oatmeal or tuna fish 
that makes you wonder 
take chicken  for example 
maybe they didn t know
what to make it taste like   
   which is why it tastes
like everything 
  and maybe they  
  shut up 
dozer 
it s a single celled protein   
   combined with synthetic aminos 
vitamins and minerals 
everything the body needs 
it doesn t have everything
the body needs 
i understand you ve run through
the agent training program 
you know  i wrote that program 
here it comes 
mouse  what did you think of her 
neo  of who 
the woman in the red dress 
i designed her 
she doesn t talk very much   
   but if you d like to meet her 
i can arrange a more personal milieu 
the digital pimp hard at work 
pay no attention to
these hypocrites  neo 
to deny our own impulses   
   is to deny the very thing
that makes us human 
dozer  when you re done   
   bring the ship up to broadcast depth 
we re going in 
i m taking neo to see her 
see who 
the oracle 
everyone please observe   
   the  fasten seat belt 
and  no smoking  signs are on 
sit back and enjoy your flight 
 phone rings

we ll be back in an hour 
 phone dials  then rings 
morpheus 
unbelievable   
   isn t it 
neo  god 
  what 
i used to eat there 
really good noodles 
i have these memories from my life 
none of them happened 
what does that mean 
that the matrix cannot tell you
who you are 
but an oracle can 
that s different 
did you go to her 
trinity 
yes 
what did she tell you 
she told me   
what 
morpheus 
we re here 
neo  come with me 
so is this the same oracle
that made   
   the prophecy 
yes  she s very old  she s been
with us since the beginning 
neo  the beginning 
  of the resistance 
and she knows what  everything 
she would say she knows enough 
and she s never wrong 
morpheus  try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong 
she is a guide  neo 
she can help you to find the path 
she helped you 
yes 
what did she tell you 
that i would find the one 
i told you i can only
show you the door 
you have to walk through it 
hello  neo 
you re right on time 
make yourself at home  morpheus 
neo  come with me 
these are the other potentials 
you can wait here 
boy 
do not try and bend the spoon 
that s impossible 
instead  only try
to realize the truth 
what truth 
there is no spoon 
there is no spoon 
then you ll see that it is not the spoon
that bends  it is only yourself 
the oracle will you see now 
oracle 
i know you re neo 
be right with you 
  you re the oracle 
  bingo 
not quite what you
were expecting  right 
almost done 
smell good  don t they 
yeah 
oracle 
i d ask you to sit down   
   but you re not going to anyway 
  and don t worry about the vase 
  what vase 
thatvase 
i m sorry 
i said  don t worry about it 
i ll get one of my kids to fix it 
how did you know 
what s really going to bake
your noodle later on is   
   would you still have broken it
if i hadn t said anything 
you re cuter than i thought 
i can see why she likes you 
who 
not too bright  though 
you know why morpheus
brought you to see me 
so   
   what do you think 
do you think you are the one 
i don t know 
you know what that means 
it s latin 
means   know thyself  
i ll let you in on a little secret 
being the one is just
like being in love 
no one can tell you you re in love 
you just know it   
   through and through 
balls to bones 
well   
   i d better have a look at you 
open your mouth  say   ah  
qkay   
now i m supposed to say 
 hmm  that s interesting  but    
then you say 
but what 
but you already know
what i m going to tell you 
  i m not the one 
  sorry  kid 
you got the gift   
   but it looks like
you re waiting for something 
what 
your next life  maybe  who knows 
that s the way these things go 
  what s funny 
  morpheus 
he almost had me convinced 
i know 
poor morpheus 
without him  we re lost 
what do you mean   without him  
are you sure you want
to hear this 
morpheus believes in you  neo 
and no one  not you  not even me   
can convince him otherwise 
he believes it so blindly   
   that he s going to sacrifice
his life to save yours 
what 
oracle  you re going to
have to make a choice 
in the one hand 
you ll have morpheus  life 
and in the other hand 
you ll have your own 
one of you is going to die 
which one will be up to you 
i m sorry  kiddo  i really am 
you have a good soul 
and i hate giving
good people bad news 
don t worry about it 
as soon as you
step outside that door   
   you ll start feeling better 
you ll remember you don t believe
in any of this fate crap 
you re in control of your own life 
remember 
here   
   take a cookie 
i promise  by the time
you re done eating it   
   you ll feel right as rain 
what was said

matrix when they change something

oh  no 
cypher  that s what they changed 
we re trapped

cypher 
hello  trinity 
cypher  where s tank 
you know   
   for a long time   
   i thought i was in love with you 
i used to dream about you 
you re a beautiful woman  trinity 
too bad things had to
turn out this way 
you killed them 
  what 
  oh  god 
i m tired  trinity 
i m tired of this war   
   tired of fighting 
i m tired of this ship   
   of being cold  of eating
the same goddamn goop every day 
but most of all   
   i m tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit 
surprise  asshole 
i bet you never saw this coming   
   did you 
god  i wish i could be there   
   when they break you 
i wish i could walk in
just when it happens   
   so right then   
   you d know it was me 
you gave them morpheus 
he lied to us  trinity 
he tricked us 
if you had told us the truth   
   we would ve told you to shove
that red pill up your ass 
that is not true  cypher 
he set us free 
 free   you call this free 
all i do is what he tells me to do 
if i had to choose between
that and the matrix   
   i choose the matrix 
the matrix isn t real 
i disagree  trinity 
i think the matrix   
   can be more real than this world 
all i do is pull the plug here 
but there   
you have to watch apoc die 
trinity 
  welcome to the real world 
  but you re out  cypher 
  you can t go back 
  that s what you think 
they ll reinsert my body 
i go back to sleep  when i wake up 
i won t remember a thing 
by the way   
   if you have anything important
to say to switch   
   say it now 
  no  please don t 
  not like this 
not like this 
too late 
goddamn you  cypher 
don t hate me  trinity 
i m just a messenger 
and right now 
i m going to prove it to you 
if morpheus was right   
   there s no way
i can pull this plug 
if neo s the one   
then there  d have to be
   some kind of a miracle to stop me 
right 
i mean  how can he be the one   
   if he s dead 
you never did answer me before   
   if you bought into
morpheus  bullshit 
come on  all i want
is a little yes or no 
look into his eyes   
   those big  pretty eyes   
   and tell me   
   yes  
   oi  i70
  yes 
  no 
i don t believe it 
believe it or not  you piece of shit 
you re still going to burn 
 phone rings 
you first 
  you re hurt 
  i ll be all right 
doze r 
smith 
have you ever stood and stared at it 
marveled at its beauty   
   its genius 
billions of people   
   just living out their lives 
oblivious 
did you know that the first matrix   
   was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered   
   where everyone would be happy 
it was a disaster 
no one would accept the program 
entire crops were lost 
some believe that   
   we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world 
but i believe that   
   as a species   
   human beings define
their reality through misery   
   and suffering 
so the perfect world was a dream   
   that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from 
which is why the matrix was
redesigned to this 
the peak   
   of your civilization 
i say   your civilization    
   because when we started thinking
for you  it became our civilization   
   which is  of course 
what this is all about 
evolution  morpheus 
evolution 
like the dinosaur 
look out that window 
you had your time 
the future is our world  morpheus 
the future is our time 
there could be a problem 
neo  what are they doing to him 
  they re breaking into his mind 
it s like hacking a computer 
all it takes is time 
how much time 
depends on the mind 
but eventually  it ll crack   
   and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this 
when it does  he ll tell them
anything they want to know 
what do they want 
the leader of every ship is given
codes to zion s mainframe computer 
if an agent got the codes
and got into zion s mainframe   
   they could destroy us 
we can t let that happen 
trinity  zion s more important than me   
   or you   
   or even morpheus 
there has to be
something we can do 
there is  we pull the plug 
you re going to kill him 
kill morpheus 
we don t have a choice 
never send a human
to do a machine s job 
if the insider has failed   
   they ll sever the connection
as soon as possible  unless  
they re dead  in either case  
we have no choice  continue as planned 
deploy the sentinels 
immediately 
morpheus  you were more
than a leader to us 
you were a father 
we ll miss you always 
s top 
i don t believe this is happening 
  neo  this has to be done 
neo  does it  
i don t know 
  this can t be just coincidence 
  what 
neo 
the oracle 
she told me this would happen 
she told me that i would
have to make a choice 
what choice 
  what are you doing 
  i m going in 
trinity  no  you re not 
  i have to 
neo  morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out 
there is no way
that you re going back in 
morpheus did what he did because
he believed i m something i m not 
what 
i m not the one  trinity 
  the oracle hit me with that too 
  no  you have to be 
i m sorry  i m not 
i m just another guy 
no  neo  that s not true 
  it can t be true 
  why 
this is loco  they ve got morpheus
in a military controlled building 
even if you somehow got inside  those
are agents holding him  three of them 
i want morpheus back too  but
what you re talking about is suicide 
that s what it looks like   
   but it s not 
i can t explain to you why it s not 
morpheus believed something  and
he was ready to give his life for it 
i understand that now 
that s why i have to go 
  why 
  because i believe in something 
what 
i believe i can bring him back 
  what are you doing 
  going with you 
  no  you re not 
iinoii 
let me tell you what i believe 
morpheus means more to me
than he does to you 
i believe if you are serious about
saving him  you will need my help 
and since i am the ranking officer   
   if you don t like it 
i believe you can go to hell 
because you aren t going anywhere else 
tank   
   load us up 
i d like to share
a revelation that i ve had   
   during my time here 
it came to me when i tried
to classify your species   
   and i realized   
   that you re not actually mammals 
every mammal on this planet   
   instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment 
but you humans do not 
you move to an area
and you multiply   
   and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed 
the only way you can survive   
   is to spread to another area 
there is another organism
on this planet   
   that follows the same pattern 
do you know what it is 
a virus 
human beings are a disease 
a cancer of this planet 
you are a plague 
and we   
   are the cure 
okay  so what do you need 
besides a miracle 
guns 
lots of guns 
neo   
no one has ever done
anything like this 
that s why it s going to work 
why isn t the serum working 
perhaps we re asking
the wrong questions 
leave me with him 
now 
tank 
hold on  morpheus 
they re coming for you 
they re coming 
smith 
can you hear me  morpheus 
i m going to be honest   
   with you 
l   
   hate   
   this place   
   this zoo   
   this prison   
   this reality 
whatever you want to call it 
i can t stand it any longer 
it s the smell 
if there is such a thing 
i feel saturated by it 
i can   
   taste   
   your stink 
and every time i do  i fear that
i have somehow been infected by it 
it s repulsive 
isn t it  
i must get out of here 
i must get free 
and in this mind is the key 
my key 
once zion is destroyed 
there is no need for me to be here 
do you understand 
i need the codes 
i have to get inside zion   
   and you have to tell me how 
you re going to tell me   
   or you re going to die 
please remove any metallic items
you re carrying  keys  loose change 
holy shit 
backup  send backup 
freeze 
what were you doing 
he doesn t know 
know what 
i think they re trying to save him 
there is no spoon 
find them and destroy them 
we re under attack 
trinity 
help 
only human 
dodge this 
  how did you do that 
  do what 
you moved like they do 
i ve never seen anyone move that fast 
it wasn t fast enough 
can you fly that thing 
not yet 
operator

morpheus   
the oracle 
  she told me  
  she told you   
   what you needed to hear 
that s all 
sooner or later you ll realize 
just as i did   
   there s a difference
between knowing the path   
   and walking the path 
  operator
