you re just saying that
 cause he says yes
to everything you ask 
that s  cause i m nice 
  you re not that nice 
  that s big talk 
see if you can back it up

   chuckles 
   darius  yeah  okay 
  come on  bro 
   both chuckle 
 lebron  dom 
what was that 
an open shot 
and if you re gonna be
out here 
it s about giving everything
that you got 
and not whatever that was 
where s your fundamentals 
we having fun 
everything in between

   beeping 
told you not to bring
that out here 
 lebron  come on  dom

for this launch 
and i ve finally found him 
lebron james 
 cooing 
 sighs 
pete  he s a family man 
an entrepreneur 
a social media superstar
with millions of fans
worldwide 
algorithmically speaking 
he s more than an athlete 
he s a king 
hmm   babbles 
i know i m just
an algorithm  pete 
that s precisely
why i need king james 
i m stuck
inside the serververse 
no one knows who i am
or what i do 
but that all changes today 
because today 
warner bros  launches
the revolutionary technology
that i masterminded 
today 
it s my time to shine 
just look at this guy  pete 
 chuckles 
oh  he is the key element
to this entire operation 
 pete babbles 
once i partner with king james
and combine his fame
with my incredible tech   
i will finally get
the recognition and respect
that i so richly deserve 
lebron james  get ready 
 computer chimes 
oh  hello 
a new idea from the algorithm 
i m listening 
 upbeat hip hop music playing 
  you want it bad
i want it more  
  sorry you had

  you want it bad
i want it more  
  sorry you had

 computer chimes 
   chuckles 
   knocking on door 
 lebron  hey  son 
what you doing 
um  just building my game 
is this the one
you ve been working on 
actually  it s basically done 
but i   
here  just   
i still have to figure out
some of the player designs 
 video game sound effects
playing 
 lebron  whoa 
who are those guys 
 dom  oh  those are
people around the world
tuning in to my livestream 
it s pretty cool  huh 
okay 
and this is how it works 
you do combos and moves 
and the better you do 
the more people tune in 
let me see
a couple of those combo moves 
 dom  crossover  foul line 
 lebron  oh  that was nice 
  ooh  posterized 
  posterized 
is this not real basketball 
well  i put a spin to it 
you can get style points

my entire character is gone 
it s gonna take me at least
a week to rebuild this 
 lebron  listen  son 
setbacks happen 
adversity is a part of
the process  man 
but if you re passionate
about something 
you gotta learn
how to push through it

 laughs 
yes  thank you  finally  huh 
put some  spec
on my name  right 
   pete cheers

  malik 
 malik  let s just hear
what they re talking about

 lebron  it s among the worst
ideas i ve ever heard 
top five  easily 
okay  thank you  thank you 
that s exactly
what i was think   
you re saying
what i m thinking

so stupid 
 woman  so stupid 
this is what happens when   
pete  tell me he did not
just say  stupid  
 pete  uh oh 
i don t know  i think
the algorithm s pretty cool 
i ve got a question 
is it a heuristic algorithm
or some kind of
matrix variant 
 chuckles  dom 
using the medulla oblongata 
i think we got a little
stevie jobs on our hands 
yeah  i m actually building
my own video game 
oh  nice  your own video game
