and im being dragged to my death
it wasnt always like this
i had a real life once
a job
ash to price check four
um hardware aisle 12
shop smart shop smart
i had a wonderful girlfriend  linda
together we drove
to a small cabin in the mountains
it seems an archeologist
had come to this remote place
to translate and study his latest find
necronomicon ex mortis
the book of the dead
bound in human flesh and inked in blood
this ancient sumerian text
contained bizarre burial rites
funerary incantations
and demonresurrection passages
it was never meant for
the world of the living
the book awoke
something dark in the woods
it took linda
and then it came for me
it got into my hand and it went bad
so i lopped it off at the wrist
but that didnt stop it it came back
big time
my god how do you stop it
where the hell
now easy now chief
i dont know how i got here
and im not lookin for any trouble
what a piece of armor this is
wiseman
fall back back on your horses
my lord i believe he is the one
written of in the necronomicon
he who is prophesied
to fall from the heavens
and deliver us from
the terrors of the deadites
what that buffoon
likely hes one of henrys men
kneel rapscallion
i say to the pit with him
thou shalt soon learn
the horrors of the pit
to the pit

mankind would be consumed by this evil
now will thou quest for the book
that one

you raised in a barn shut the door
probably was raised in a barn
with all the other primitives
the wisemen say that
thou art the promised one
tis said that thou wilt journey
for the book to help us
and thou wilt lead
our people against the evil
the only reason im goin
to get the book is to get home
i believe thou wilt leave in the morning
dont touch that
your primitive intellect
wouldnt understand alloys and
things with molecular structures and
what are you doing here anyway
i wanted to say that all of my hopes
and prayers go with thee
and i made this for thee
good i could use a horse blanket
gimme some sugar baby
hyah
come on boy
hyah

this path will lead you
to an unholy place  a cemetery
there the necronomicon awaits
when thou retrievest the book
from its cradle you must recite
klaatu verata nikto
