and i m being dragged to my death 
it wasn t always like this 
i had a real life once 
a job 
ash to price check four 
um  hardware  aisle 12 
shop smart  shop s mart 
i had a wonderful girlfriend   linda 
together we drove
to a small cabin in the mountains 
it seems an archeologist
had come to this remote place
to translate and study his latest find 
 necronomicon ex mortis  
 the book of the dead  
bound in human flesh and inked in blood 
this ancient sumerian text
contained bizarre burial rites 
funerary incantations
and demon resurrection passages 
it was never meant for
the world of the living 
the book awoke
something dark in the woods 
it took linda 
and then it came for me 
it got into my hand and it went bad 
so i lopped it off at the wrist 
but that didn t stop it  it came back 
big time 
my god  how do you stop it  
where the hell    
now    easy now  chief 
i don t know how i got here 
and    i m not lookin  for any trouble 
what a piece of armor this is 
  wiseman 
  fall back  back on your horses 
my lord  i believe he is the one
written of in the necronomicon 
he who is prophesied
to fall from the heavens
and deliver us from
the terrors of the deadites 
what  that buffoon 
likely    he s one of henry s men 
kneel  rapscallion 
i say to the pit with him 
thou shalt soon learn
the horrors of the pit

but last night he fell in battle
to duke henry s men

and while my people fight
for their very souls against it 
you  henry the red  wage war on us 
charlatan

your swords on us 
and this evil has befouled
my people as well 
your people are no better
than the foul corruption
  that lies in the bowels of that pit 
  right  you re no better 
may god have mercy upon your souls 
in god s name 
what hell spawned thing lurks there 
into the pit with those
bloodthirsty sons of whores

only the necronomicon has the power 
an unholy book which we also require 
within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time 
only you  the promised one 
can quest for it 
i don t want your book  or your bullshit 
send me back to my own time  pronto   
you shall die 
you shall never take the necronomicon 
we shall feast upon your soul 
it s a trick  get an axe 
oh  my eyes  i m blind

let s go 
if the deadites had the necronomicon  all
mankind would be consumed by this evil 
now will thou quest for the book 
that one 
hyah 
groovy 
what s the matter 
you raised in a barn  shut the door 
probably was raised in a barn 
with all the other primitives 
the wisemen say that
thou art the promised one 
 tis said that thou wilt journey
for the book to help us
and thou wilt lead
our people against the evil 
the only reason i m goin 
to get the book is to get home 
  i believe thou wilt leave in the morning 
  don t touch that 
your primitive intellect
wouldn t understand alloys and   
things with molecular structures and   
what are you doing here anyway 
i wanted to say that all of my hopes
and prayers go with thee 
and i made this for thee 
good  i could use a horse blanket 
gimme some sugar  baby 
hyah 
come on  boy 
hyah 
hyah 
steady now  whoa 
what  what is it 
this path will lead you
to an unholy place   a cemetery 
there the necronomicon awaits 
when thou retrievest the book
from its cradle  you must recite 
klaatu verata nikto 
klaatu    verata    nikto  ok
