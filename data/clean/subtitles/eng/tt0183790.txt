and name a man better
with a sword than i am
in the practice ring
youre not of noble birth
so we lie
how did the nobles become noble
in the first place
they took it at the tip of a sword
ill do it with a lance
a blunted lance
no matter wat
a man can change his stars i wont
spend the rest of my life as nothing
that is nothing and thats
where glory will take us
were peasants glory and riches
are beyond our grasp

uhtrudging
you know trudging to trudge
to trudge the slow weary
depressing yet determined walk
of a man who had nothing left
except the impulse to simply
soldier on
were you robbed
interesting question yes
and at the same time
a huge resounding no
its more a sort of involuntary
vow of poverty really
but on the brighter side
trudging does represent pride
pride resolve and faith
in the good lord almighty

my armors loose
shite i cant block an overhead
we cant fix it now
were overdue in the sword ring
it was a mistake to do two events
im too hurried
ill withdraw from the sword
swords what youre best at
but the prizes and prestige
are bigger in the joust
ulrich von lichtenstein
i am simon the summoner
im overdue at the sword ring
i must detain you
on behalf of your herald
you were never robbed
i have a gambling problem
i cant help myself
and these people will
literally take the clothes
off your back
what are we supposed to do
he assured us that you
his liege would pay us
and who are you
peter a humble pardoner
and purveyor of religious relics
how much does he owe
ten gold florins
you manky git
pain pain take the pain
get him off me
wat let him go
what would you do to him
if i was to refuse
we on behalf of the lord god
will take it from his flesh
so that he may understand
that gambling is a sin
oh come on
please will
please will you help me
sir ulrich
i promise you wont regret it
i dont have the money
release him
and give him back his clothes
and youll get it
done
you lied
yes i lied im a writer
i give the truth scope
behold my lord
ulrich von lichtenstein son of
too late hes been announced
fine
ten blows by sword
sir ulrich to receive first
strike
strike
stop letting him hit you
shut up shut up
two strikes for sir walter loring
sir ulrich to strike
now its your turn
come on
strike
i taught him that
thats me
sir ulrich prevails
five strikes to two
yes
behold my lord ulrich
the rock the hard place
like a wind from gelderland
he sweeps by
blown far from his homeland
in search of glory and honor
we walk in the garden
of his turbulence
yeah
youre champion
of the sword
isnt that why were here come on
do you want to touch him
do you want to touch him
we shouldve saved our money
for the blacksmith
i cant pay you now
but i promise i will just as
no money
excuse me
cash first not promises
go on
excuse me sir
you might try the farris
a woman
beggars cannot be choosers my lord
thank you
excuse me
i dont work for free
i cant joust with broken armor
thats your problem not mine
each drop of this sweat
has a price on it
just as well they told me
i was daft to even ask
who
the other armorers
did they say i couldnt do it
because im a woman
they said youre good
with horseshoes not armor
no one mentioned you being a woman
cats meat hot wine
cats meat hot wine
lady i will win
this tournament for you
nay i will win for you
may i present count adhemar
winner of the joust in france
and champion at saintemilion
all forgotten when standing before the
most beautiful woman in christendom
do you only pretend to fight count
adhemar or wage real war as well
i am leader of the free companies
my army is in southern france
geoff tis my lady
william you aim too high
i dont know any other way to aim
concentrate
what should i say to her
what do you think of the joust
its very abrupt
and i dont understand the rules
then i shall educate you
a match is three lances
one point is given for breaking
a lance between the waist and neck
two points for breaking on the helmet
its difficult
the helmet sweeps back
most blows glance off
three points for bearing a rider
to the ground
also if you bear a rider
to the ground you win his horse
do men die in the joust
lance points are tipped
with coronals which blunts them
of course accidents happen
i myself jocelyn
have never been unhorsed
nor have i
your name lady
i still need to hear it
sir hunter you persist
perhaps angels have no names
only beautiful faces
and you are
i am um
have you forgotten
or your name is sir um
ulrich von lichtenstein
from gelderland
id forget as well what a mouthful
your armor sir
what about it
how stylish of you to wear an antique
youll start a new fashion if you win
my grandfather will be able
to wear his in public again
and a shield how quaint
some of these poor country knights
little better than peasants
the second son
of sir wallace percival
third earl of warwick
my lords my ladies
it is with honor
i introduce my liege
sir thomas colville
youre good
youre very good
my lords
my ladies
and everybody else here
not sitting on a cushion
today
you find yourselves equals
for you are all equally blessed
for i have the pride
the privilege nay the pleasure
of introducing to you
a knight sired by knights
a knight who can trace
his lineage back
beyond charlemagne
i first met him
atop a mountain near jerusalem
praying to god
asking his forgiveness
for the saracen blood
spilt by his sword
next he amazed me
still further in italy
when he saved a fatherless
beauty
from the wouldbe ravishings
of her dreadful uncle
in greece
he spent a year in silence
just to better understand
the sound
of a whisper
so without further gilding the lily
and with no more ado
i give to you
the seeker of serenity
protector of italian virginity
the enforcer of our lord god
the one the only
sir ulrich von lichtenstein
thank you thank you
ill be here all week
that was different
its time we celebrated
our differences
just maybe not in public
you
yes im well aware
a good fonging is on the way
oh yeah oh yeah
i got their attention
you win their hearts
very good
was she watching geoff
what
did she see me
yes she did
did she see me take the hit
yes
was she concerned
her eyes welled up just awful
colville has perfect technique
ive never seen him before
nor i
but this lichtenstein
his technique rudimentary
style nonexistent
still hes fearless
fearless how so
the slit in the visor is narrow
but splinters can penetrate it
most knights raise their chins
at the last instant
you lose sight of your opponent but
protect your eyes ulrich doesnt
he keeps his eye on the target
a true hunter
sir ulrich
lm through
but ive never not finished before
i wish to keep my honor intact
a draw and colville is hurt
colville withdraws ulrich advances
why didnt ulrich finish him
he shows mercy
then he shows his weakness
thats all mercy is
for the love of victory william
go to sleep
i cant
love has given me wings
so i must fly
i cant explain it
she makes me feel like a poet
you may feel like a poet
but you sound like an idiot
you dont even know her name
her name
her name is aphrodite
calypso venus take your pick
women weaken the heart
without your heart you cannot win
but her eyes
concentrate
tansy cakes
count adhemar sends word
he said he will win
this tournament for you
hes won many he wins them
for himself and his own honor
its nothing to say
he wins them for me
he wishes to speak to you again
not to hear a word i say
adhemar wants his women silent
would you have sir ulrich
win the tournament for you
no
and he is the only knight
who has not promised to do so
sir ulrich von lichtenstein
i would have him win my heart
adhemar adhemar adhemar
oh lovely
i dont think ive ever seen
count adhemar lose
no but defeat him
and youll see it firsthand
my liege
sir ulrich
christiana
my lady bids you wear this token
of course
she also said to tell you her name
is jocelyn
au revoir
au revoir
oh jocelyn
concentrate
i cant breathe
no style whatsoever
but neither has an anvil
he hits like a hammer amazing
but not perfect he aims high
roll your shoulder back
his blow may go right
but if he strikes to my left
ill be obliterated
i didnt say it wasnt a gamble
ulrich ulrich ulrich ulrich
william
william here

someday ill be a knight

to change the stars

hell be crushed killed

it is strange to think
i have not seen you in a month
i have seen the new moon but not you
i have seen sunsets and sunrises but
nothing of your beautiful face
thats very good
i knew this girl once who
she broke my heart
i said the pieces

pass through the eye of a needle
he writes as though i had died
yes madame he dies as well
she used to cook for the duke of york
i miss her like the sun
misses the flower
i miss you like the sun
misses the flower
like the sun misses the flower
in the depths of winter
instead of beauty to direct
its light to
the heart hardens like the frozen
world your absence has sent me to
i next compete in paris
ill find it empty and cold
if youre not there
i like it
and now to finish it
with hope
love should end with hope
my husband god rest him

especially the night
the hope that after you

cinquante
thats a nice round number
excusemoi
they wager that a frenchman not
sir ulrich will win the tournament
but the amount is 50 florins
thats all we got
lf we had 60 it would be that
ulrich against every frenchman here
hes won four tournaments in a row
and adhemar isnt here
i check shields too
john beaumonts here
count theobald philip of burgundy
all french champions
englishmen will not win
this french tournament
english legs are unsteady
on french soil
shut your mouth all right
come on roland its a good bet
win and i can buy my own tavern
i could write fulltime
a forge for me
and because french wine
is too much for english bellies
listen im about this fonging close
mate i swear to god quasimodo
all i want is to go home and ive
enough for that trip a hundred times
and most importantly because
the pope himself is french
the pope may be french
but jesus is english youre on
he wont lose with the princess
watching him
hes blond hes pissed
hell see you in the lists
lichtenstein lichtenstein
hes blond hes tan
he comes from gelderland
he comes from gelderland
gelderland
you think he will come
as sure as the sun will rise
you favor cathedrals
i come for confession
and the glass
a riot of color in a dreary
gray world
dont you think
its beautiful
i feel the same about
the letter you sent
speak to me
speak those words
i will win this tournament for you
excuse me
ill win this tournament in your name
ill defeat each knight for you
your beauty will be reflected in the
power of my arm and my horses flanks
wow
really
really its flanks
i wish to hear poetry ulrich
well im not ready
i am why must everything for
a woman be run on a mans schedule
well a mans day is fuller and
he has more demands on his time
ls that so
yes
maybe
no
i demand poetry
and when i want it
and i want it now
your breasts
theyre below your throat
jocelyn how may i prove
my love to you how
do you ask in earnest
yes
if you would prove your love
do your worst
my worst
what do you mean
instead of winning to honor me
with your high reputation
act against your character
and do badly
do badly
lose
losing proves that im a loser
wrong losing is a much keener
test of your love
losing would contradict
your selflove
it would show obedience
to your lover and not yourself
really
woman shh
do not shh me and spare him
now be gone go
what is your answer
i will not lose
then you do not love me
the protector of italian virginity
the lance that thrilled france
the harasser of paraser
he gave them hell at la rochelle
the enforcer of our lord god
the one the only
sir ulrich
von lichtenstein
god im good
his horses flanks
maybe where he comes from
it means love
what are you doing
losing
i dont understand
neither do i
he loves me
are you blind
did you see the flag
i saw it okay
i know
youre dropping behind
for a more dramatic victory
look jocelyn told me to lose
to prove my love
id rather you were blind
dont be foolish will
each woman wants proof thats all
proof of what
her legs werent uncrossed
for nothing
i havent uncrossed her legs
then why are we doing this
because
because
i love her
im going to lose everything
thats why its called gambling
pain heres your pain
its very romantic though
are you a woman or a blacksmith
sometimes im both
ooh that chafes
put him down
no knight has distanced himself
with victories
if you win your remaining matches
and your opponents take key losses
you could make the semis
or the finals
at least the armors proven itself
and your love
have you proven that
wat you remember church as a boy
the fear the passion
thats what she makes me feel
and for that i say my rosary
to jocelyn and no one else
william thats blasphemous
then may i burn in hell
withdraw
lose that way
take no more punishment
oh roland
my lady sends this message
if you love her

committing the oldest sins
in the newest ways
at last we will face each other again
sir ulrich
and at the world championship
and as i promised you before
you will look up at me
from the flat of your back
let the past die
youve done well in my absence

with her father
im to make her my bride
shell be saddled
and placed on my mantle

ulrich ulrich ulrich
how would you beat him
with a stick while he slept
but on a horse with a lance
that man is unbeatable
hello there
youre sir ulrich von lichtenstein

at the window but no one knows why
what do you mean
hes blind sir

being chanted from the stadium
what business have you here

word of your son
of my william well come in sir

he wanted you to know
that he changed his stars

because he was also so strong
very strong
geoff
jocelyn
this day just gets better and better
somebody die
sir ulrich von lichtenstein
adhemar
followed you last night
to cheapside
he saw your father
will they asked me for your patents
theyre waiting for you
in the lists to arrest you
a dozen royal guards
theyll put you in the stocks
but i face adhemar in five minutes
no you forfeit
theyve already marked it down
saddle the horses
they can arrest your baggage not you
halt
so what do you think
now that you know what i am
to know what you are william
would take a lifetime
one i am willing to give
but now you must run
run and i will run with you
jocelyn i cannot run
i am a knight and i will
put myself to the hazard
in your heart not on paper
and papers what matters to them
william i love you
i love you you
i wont see you led to the stocks
but youll see me run no
damn your pride william
it is only you that
will not see you run
prides the one thing they cant take
but they can take it from you
they can and they will
oh they will
but love they cannot take
and where will we live
in my hovel
with the pigs inside in winter
yes william with the pigs
with the pigs
the poor can marry for love
jocelyn you speak of what
you do not know
william i beg you
please
run do it for love
roland you would see me run
and you geoff
i wish it too with all
the pieces of my heart
wat you and i we arent runners
yes
william today we are
run william
i will not run
i am a knight
well boys
all good things must come to an end
lets end them together
you will remove yourself
from this position of honor
i am here to compete
you are here to be arrested
all right
he that strives to touch a star
oft stumbles
at a simple straw
you have been weighed
you have been measured
and you have been found wanting
its one loss or anotherwilliam
in what world could you
have ever beaten me
leave roland
let them have me
god love you william
so do i
go disperse
or i will fong you
as jesus christ the nazarene
and his holy mother
the virgin mary are my witnesses
i will fong you
i will rip you fist pain
ill stick my fist and break you
pain lots of pain
were in trouble
listen to me
listen to me
what a pair we make huh
both trying to hide who we are
both unable to do so
your men love you
if i knew nothing else about you
that would be enough
but you also tilt
when you should withdraw
that is knightly too
release him
he may appear to be
of humble origins
but my personal historians
have discovered
that he descends
from an ancient royal line
this is my word
and as such is beyond contestation
now
if i may repay the kindness
you once showed me
take a knee
by the power vested in me
by my father king edward
and by all the witnesses here
i dub thee
sir william
arisesir william
can you joust
theres my tournament to finish
now are you fit to compete
or shall the forfeit stand
im fit
i shall have your opponent informed
look for his shield on the lists
at once
thank you my lord
all hail prince edward
my lords my ladies
and all you other people
i give you the son of philippe
de vitry son of gilles
are you sure
yes
its nothing but spun sugar
and boot black
its a small target
but aim for his heart
doer of daring deeds
conqueror of countless kingdoms
count
adhemar
oh god ill get the surgeon
roland
youre the surgeon
come on
he tipped it
kate get me back to one
otherwise we forfeit
dirty son of a bitch
kate i cant breathe
i cant breathe
as i said thatcher
in what world could you
have ever beaten me
such a place does not exist
shes here
with your father
change your stars
lets dance you and i
its two lances to none
you must unhorse him or kill him
its the only way to win
you need more padding
no leave it off
i cant breathe with it on
lance
i can barely grip it
damn
lash it to my arm
wat
lash it to me arm
do it
good people
i missed my introduction
but please
please i pray you
hear it now
for i would lay rest
the grace in my tongue
and speak plain
days like these
are far too rare to cheapen
with heavyhanded words
and so im afraid
without any ado whatsoever
excuse me my lord
here he is one of your own
born a stones throw from
this very stadium
and here before you now
the son of john thatcher
sir william thatcher
thats your name
sir william thatcher
your father heard that
godspeed william
william
you have been weighed
youve been measured
and you absolutely
have been found wanting
welcome to the new world
god save you if it is right
that he should do so
william
yes
hes won hes won
you beat him will
oh william
im going to write this story
