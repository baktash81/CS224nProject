oh  wait up 
you re going the wrong way 
you can t even joust 
most of it is the guts to take a blow 
guts i have 
and technique 
i have a month to learn that 
and name a man better
with a sword than i am 
 in the practice ring 
 you re not of noble birth 
so  we lie 
how did the nobles become noble
in the first place 
they took it at the tip of a sword 
i ll do it with a lance 
 a blunted lance 
 no matter  wat 
a man can change his stars  i won t
spend the rest of my life as nothing 
that is nothing  and that s
where glory will take us 
we re peasants  glory and riches
are beyond our grasp 
but a full stomach 
that dream can come true 
if you can take your coins

fine  fine 
morning 
morning 
hoy  sir 
what are you doing 
uh   trudging 
you know  trudging  to trudge 
to trudge the slow  weary   
   depressing  yet determined walk
of a man who had nothing left   
   except the impulse to simply
soldier on 
were you robbed 
interesting question  yes 
and at the same time 
a huge  resounding   no  
it s more a sort of involuntary
vow of poverty  really 
but on the brighter side 
trudging does represent pride 
pride  resolve and faith
in the good lord almighty 
please  christ  rescue me
from my tribu    
    lations 
who are you 
lilium inter spinas

so you may better serve god 
oh  i do  my lord  i pray for it all

but we may not know it 
well  that is lovely 
sir ulrich von lichtenstein

 ulrich s broken thousands of lances 
come on  you re due
in the sword ring 
my armor s loose 
shite  i can t block an overhead 
we can t fix it now 
we re overdue in the sword ring 
it was a mistake to do two events 
i m too hurried 
 i ll withdraw from the sword 
 sword s what you re best at 
but the prizes and prestige
are bigger in the joust 
ulrich von lichtenstein 
i am simon the summoner 
i m overdue at the sword ring 
i must detain you
on behalf of your herald 
you were never robbed 
i have a gambling problem 
i can t help myself 
and these people will   
   literally take the clothes
off your back 
what are we supposed to do 
he assured us that you 
his liege  would pay us 
and who are you 
peter  a humble pardoner   
   and purveyor of religious relics 
how much does he owe 
ten gold florins 
you manky git 
 pain  pain  take the pain 
 get him off me 
wat  let him go 
what would you do to him
if i was to refuse 
we  on behalf of the lord god   
   will take it from his flesh
so that he may understand   
   that gambling is a sin 
oh  come on 
please  will 
please  will you help me 
sir ulrich 
i promise you won t regret it 
i don t have the money 
release him   
   and give him back his clothes 
and you ll get it 
done 
you lied 
yes  i lied  i m a writer 
i give the truth scope 
behold my lord
ulrich von lichtenstein  son of  
 too late  he s been announced 
 fine 
ten blows by sword 
sir ulrich to receive first 
strike 
strike 
stop letting him hit you 
shut up  shut up 
two strikes for sir walter loring 
sir ulrich to strike 
 now it s your turn 
 come on 
strike 
i taught him that 
that s me 
sir ulrich prevails 
five strikes to two 
yes 
behold my lord ulrich 
the rock  the hard place 
like a wind from gelderland 
he sweeps by 
blown far from his homeland
in search of glory and honor 
we walk in the garden
of his turbulence 
yeah 
 you re champion 
 of the sword 
isn t that why we re here  come on 
do you want to touch him 
do you want to touch him 
we should ve saved our money
for the blacksmith 
i can t pay you now   
    but i promise i will  just as  
 no  money 
 excuse me 
 cash first  not promises 
go on 
excuse me  sir 
you might try the farris 
a woman 
beggars cannot be choosers  my lord 
thank you 
 excuse me 
 i don t work for free 
 i can t joust with broken armor 
 that s your problem  not mine 
each drop of this sweat
has a price on it 
just as well  they told me
i was daft to even ask 
 who 
 the other armorers 
did they say i couldn t do it
because i m a woman 
they said you re good
with horseshoes  not armor 
no one mentioned you being a woman 
cat s meat  hot wine 
cat s meat  hot wine 
lady  i will win
this tournament for you 
nay  i will win for you 
may i present count adhemar   
   winner of the joust in france
and champion at saint emilion 
all forgotten when standing before the
most beautiful woman in christendom 
do you only pretend to fight  count
adhemar  or wage real war as well 
i am leader of the free companies 
my army is in southern france 
geoff   tis my lady 
 william  you aim too high 
 i don t know any other way to aim 
 concentrate 
 what should i say to her 
what do you think of the joust 
it s very abrupt 
and i don t understand the rules 
then i shall educate you 
a match is three lances 
one point is given for breaking
a lance between the waist and neck 
two points for breaking on the helmet 
it s difficult 
the helmet sweeps back 
most blows glance off 
three points for bearing a rider
to the ground 
also  if you bear a rider
to the ground  you win his horse 
do men die in the joust 
lance points are tipped
with coronals  which blunts them 
of course  accidents happen 
i myself  jocelyn 
have never been unhorsed 
nor have i 
your name  lady 
i still need to hear it 
sir hunter  you persist 
perhaps angels have no names 
only beautiful faces 
and you are 
i am  um    
have you forgotten 
or your name is sir  um  
ulrich von lichtenstein
from gelderland 
i d forget as well  what a mouthful 
 your armor  sir 
 what about it 
how stylish of you to wear an antique 
you ll start a new fashion if you win 
my grandfather will be able
to wear his in public again 
and a shield  how quaint 
some of these poor country knights 
little better than peasants 
  the second son   
   of sir wallace percival 
third earl of warwick 
my lords  my ladies   
   it is with honor
i introduce my liege   
   sir thomas colville 
you re good 
you re very good 
my lords   
   my ladies   
   and everybody else here
not sitting on a cushion   
   today   
   you find yourselves equals 
for you are all equally blessed 
for i have the pride   
   the privilege  nay  the pleasure   
   of introducing to you
a knight sired by knights 
a knight who can trace
his lineage back   
   beyond charlemagne 
i first met him   
   atop a mountain near jerusalem   
   praying to god   
   asking his forgiveness
for the saracen blood   
   spilt by his sword 
next  he amazed me
still further in italy   
   when he saved a fatherless
beauty   
   from the would be ravishings
of her dreadful uncle 
in greece   
   he spent a year in silence   
   just to better understand
the sound   
   of a whisper 
so without further gilding the lily
and with no more ado   
   i give to you
the seeker of serenity   
   protector of italian virginity   
   the enforcer of our lord god 
the one  the only   
   sir ulrich von lichtenstein 
thank you  thank you 
i ll be here all week 
that was different 
it s time we celebrated
our differences 
just maybe not in public 
you    
yes  i m well aware
a good fonging is on the way 
oh  yeah  oh  yeah 
i got their attention 
you win their hearts 
very good 
 was she watching  geoff 
 what 
 did she see me 
 yes  she did 
 did she see me take the hit 
 yes 
 was she concerned 
 her eyes welled up  just awful 
colville has perfect technique 
i ve never seen him before 
nor i 
but this lichtenstein 
his technique  rudimentary 
style  nonexistent 
still  he s fearless 
fearless  how so 
the slit in the visor is narrow 
but splinters can penetrate it 
most knights raise their chins
at the last instant 
you lose sight of your opponent  but
protect your eyes  ulrich doesn t 
he keeps his eye on the target 
a true hunter 
sir ulrich   
   l m through 
but i ve never not finished before 
i wish to keep my honor intact 
a draw  and colville is hurt 
colville withdraws  ulrich advances 
why didn t ulrich finish him 
he shows mercy 
then he shows his weakness 
that s all mercy is 
for the love of victory  william 
go to sleep 
i can t 
love has given me wings 
so i must fly 
i can t explain it 
 she makes me feel like a poet 
 you may feel like a poet   
   but you sound like an idiot 
 you don t even know her name 
 her name 
her name is aphrodite 
calypso  venus  take your pick 
women weaken the heart 
without your heart  you cannot win 
 but her eyes  
 concentrate 
tansy cakes 
count adhemar sends word 
he said he will win
this tournament for you 
he s won many  he wins them
for himself and his own honor 
it s nothing to say
he wins them for me 
he wishes to speak to you again 
not to hear a word i say 
adhemar wants his women silent 
would you have sir ulrich
win the tournament for you 
no 
and he is the only knight
who has not promised to do so 
sir ulrich von lichtenstein 
i would have him win my heart 
adhemar  adhemar  adhemar 
oh  lovely 
i don t think i ve ever seen
count adhemar lose 
no  but defeat him
and you ll see it firsthand 
my liege 
sir ulrich 
christiana 
 my lady bids you wear this token 
 of course 
she also said to tell you  her name   
   is jocelyn 
 au revoir 
 au revoir 
oh  jocelyn 
concentrate 
i can t breathe 
no style whatsoever 
but neither has an anvil 
 he hits like a hammer  amazing 
 but not perfect  he aims high 
roll your shoulder back 
his blow may go right 
but if he strikes to my left 
i ll be obliterated 
i didn t say it wasn t a gamble 
ulrich  ulrich  ulrich  ulrich 
william 
william  here 
come here 
someday i ll be a knight 
a thatcher s son  a knight 
you might as well try
to change the stars

 yes  william 
if he believes enough 
a man can do anything 
come here

ulrich von lichtenstein

and tournament champion   
   adhemar  count of anjou 
adhemar  adhemar  adhemar

every last character flaw 
i was naked for a day 
you will be naked for eternity 
i have a feeling we shall meet again

the armor you wear  it wasn t
made for you  was it

i could make armor you wouldn t
even know you wore it

 no  it ll tunic up quite nicely 
that s not a disaster  roland

sir ulrich  you look fantastic 
jocelyn  you look    
uh  you   
   remind me of the bible 
when god stopped the sun to give
joshua time to defeat the amorites 
i don t understand 
if i could ask god one thing   
   it would be to stop the moon 
stop the moon and make this night   
   and your beauty   
   last forever 
what dance will you have  a coranto 
or a basse dance 
sir ulrich 
why don t you show us a dance
of your country 
show us a dance of gelderland 
yes  gelderland 
well  it s a lot like the farandole   
   but with some differences 
well  you bow 
and   
   and    
places  places 
what 
 i don t know  too small  too light 
 he ll be crushed  killed 
no  i found a new way to heat steel 
it s thinner  smaller   
   but just as strong 
what are these 
the marks of my trade should
another knight admire the armor 
twist and bend  feel the movement 
 but eventually i will be struck 
 and then death 
do you at least have the courage
to test it 
you okay 
i didn t feel a thing 
 who s that knight 
 piers courtenay 
he s raised taxes on his land 3 times
this year to pay for tournament 
his people starve while
he sits at banquet 
it s probably true 
ulrich  ulrich  ulrich  ulrich 
ulrich von lichtenstein 
the count adhemar   
   son of philippe de vitry   
   son of gilles   
   master of the free companies   
   defender of his enormous manhood   
   a shining example of chivalry   
   and champagne 
nice work 
bravo

we ll find a weakness 
well  colville looks fit 
  my liege   
   the second son of
sir wallace percival 
it is my deepest honor  
my deepest honor to present to you    
it s edward  my lord 
they re sure of it 
  the illustrious sir thomas colville 
adhemar withdrew

royalty 
i ll see what i can find out 
prepare to drop the flag

musicians  announce 
 i must speak with my lord 
 then go 
see if you can beat the second coming

and a rose never knocked
a man off a horse either  did it

i miss her throat 
still higher  towards the heavens 
the moon  her breasts
weren t that impressive 
the moon  the moon 
 it is strange to think   
   i have not seen you in a month 
i have seen the new moon  but not you 
i have seen sunsets and sunrises  but
nothing of your beautiful face  
that s very good 
i knew this girl once who    
she broke my heart 
i said the pieces  
 the pieces of my broken heart can
pass through the eye of a needle  
he writes as though i had died 
yes  madame  he dies as well 
she used to cook for the duke of york 
i miss her like the sun
misses the flower 
 i miss you like the sun
misses the flower 
like the sun misses the flower
in the depths of winter 
instead of beauty to direct
its light to   
   the heart hardens like the frozen
world your absence has sent me to  
 i next compete in paris 
i ll find it empty and cold
if you re not there  
i like it 
and now  to finish it 
with  hope  
love should end with hope 
my husband  god rest him   
   said something i ll never forget 
 hope guides me  it   
 it gets me through the day and
especially the night 
the hope that after you
leave my sight   
   it will not be the last time
i look upon you  
finish it with 
 with all the love
that i possess   william  
you mean  ulrich  
 with all the love i possess   
   i remain yours   
   the knight of your heart  
my master hoped you might have
something to send him in return 
cock a doodle once  i shall not deny
him  twice  i shall not  thrice 
i deny him 
thrice he denied him 
no adhemar 
no adhemar 
wat 
tell me  did you see her 
did she read the letter 
yes  and yes 
and 
she s coming to paris 
did she give you anything for me in
return  a letter  a token 
did she give me a token  she did 
uh  i mean  um    
well  what is it  give it to me 
yes 
hell  yes 
she   because she s  
that means she   yeah 
cinquante 
that s a nice round number 
excuse moi 
they wager that a frenchman  not
sir ulrich  will win the tournament 
but the amount is 50 florins 
 that s all we got 
 lf we had 60  it would be that 
ulrich against every frenchman here 
he s won four tournaments in a row 
and adhemar isn t here 
i check shields too 
john beaumont s here 
count theobald  philip of burgundy  
all french champions 
englishmen will not win   
   this french tournament 
english legs are unsteady
on french soil 
shut your mouth  all right  
come on  roland  it s a good bet 
win and i can buy my own tavern 
 i could write full time 
 a forge for me 
and because french wine
is too much for english bellies 
listen  i m about this fonging close 
mate  i swear to god  quasimodo 
all i want is to go home  and i ve
enough for that trip a hundred times 
and most importantly  because
the pope himself is french 
the pope may be french 
but jesus is english  you re on 
he won t lose with the princess
watching him 
he s blond  he s pissed 
he ll see you in the lists 
lichtenstein  lichtenstein 
he s blond  he s tan 
he comes from gelderland 
he comes from gelderland 
gelderland 
 you think he will come 
 as sure as the sun will rise 
you favor cathedrals 
i come for confession 
and the glass 
a riot of color in a dreary 
gray world 
don t you think 
it s beautiful 
i feel the same about
the letter you sent 
speak to me 
speak those words 
i will win this tournament for you 
excuse me 
i ll win this tournament in your name 
i ll defeat each knight for you 
your beauty will be reflected in the
power of my arm and my horse s flanks 
wow 
really 
really  its flanks 
i wish to hear poetry  ulrich 
well  i m not ready 
i am  why must everything for
a woman be run on a man s schedule 
well  a man s day is fuller  and   
   he has more demands on his time 
 ls that so 
 yes 
maybe 
no 
i demand poetry   
   and when i want it 
and i want it now 
your breasts   
   they re below your throat    
jocelyn  how may i prove
my love to you  how 
 do you ask in earnest 
 yes 
if you would prove your love   
    do your worst 
 my worst 
what do you mean 
instead of winning to honor me
with your high reputation   
   act against your character
and do badly 
 do badly 
 lose 
losing proves that i m a loser 
wrong  losing is a much keener
test of your love 
losing would contradict
your self love 
it would show obedience
to your lover and not yourself 
 really 
 woman  shh 
do not  shh  me and spare him 
now be gone  go 
what is your answer 
i will not lose 
then you do not love me 
the protector of italian virginity   
   the lance that thrilled france   
   the harasser of paraser 
he gave them hell at la rochelle 
the enforcer of our lord god 
the one  the only   
   sir ulrich   
   von lichtenstein 
god  i m good 
his horse s flanks 
maybe where he comes from 
it means love 
what are you doing 
 losing 
 i don t understand 
neither do i 
he loves me 
are you blind 
 did you see the flag 
 i saw it  okay 
i know 
you re dropping behind
for a more dramatic victory 
look  jocelyn told me to lose
to prove my love 
 i d rather you were blind 
 don t be foolish  will 
 each woman wants proof  that s all 
 proof of what 
her legs weren t uncrossed
for nothing 
 i haven t uncrossed her legs 
 then why are we doing this  
because 
because   
   i love her 
 i m going to lose everything 
 that s why it s called gambling 
pain  here s your pain 
it s very romantic  though 
are you a woman or a blacksmith 
sometimes i m both 
ooh  that chafes 
put him down 
no knight has distanced himself
with victories 
if you win your remaining matches
and your opponents take key losses   
   you could make the semis 
or the finals 
 at least the armor s proven itself 
 and your love 
have you proven that 
wat  you remember church as a boy 
the fear  the passion 
that s what she makes me feel 
and for that  i say my rosary
to jocelyn and no one else 
william  that s blasphemous 
then may i burn in hell 
withdraw 
lose that way 
take no more punishment 
oh  roland 
my lady sends this message 
if you love her  
i know  i know  i must lose 
isn t she watching 
she says if you love her 
you won t lose again 
she says if you love her 
you will win this tournament 
there she is  the embodiment of love 
your venus 
and how i hate her 
 i don t understand women 
 nor do i  but they understand us 
maybe not you 
yes 
women  eh 
forty eight   
   forty nine   
   and fifty 
thank you  gentlemen 
a pleasure doing business with you 
look us up if you re in london 
the world championships  maybe 
don t look too sad 
here  have a drink on me 
he s quick  he s funny and
makes lots of money  lichtenstein 
guinevere comes to lancelot 
bed him well  my lady 
bed him well 
we missed you at banquet

jocelyn

i am not worthy of a prize 
then who is

yes 
it is so 
your name makes no matter to me 
just so i can call you my own 
but jocelyn  i am your own 
damn  girl 
you need a surgeon 
he s been  he says i will live 
though it doesn t feel that way 
oh  william  this pain is my doing 
yes  it is 
although   
   my father   
   taught me to take the bad   
   with the good 
this good you speak of 
it will be my doing as well 
how long since any of you have been
back  i ve only been gone 6 months 
two years for me

william

show me your arm  is it strong 
well  he s a half starved little
scarecrow 
but he has spirit 
i can show you a great wide world
full of adventure   
   and marvels you
do not yet dream of 
can you pack my horse and lead it 
well  come on 
say goodbye to your father 
he s a real knight  william 
watch and learn all you can 
it s all i can do for you  son 
now go change your stars
and live a better life than i have 
roland  show the boy his duties 
 father  i m afraid 
 of what 
i won t know the way home 
don t be foolish  william 
you just follow your feet 
london 
give us a shout out  london 
ulrich  ulrich  ulrich  ulrich 
 adhemar s here  he s entered 
 must have grown bored with war 
no  the black prince commanded it 
he had to disband his army 
they were reveling 
pillaging town after town 
robbing  murdering 
ransacking churches 
committing the oldest sins
in the newest ways 
at last we will face each other again 
sir ulrich 
and at the world championship 
and as i promised you before   
   you will look up at me
from the flat of your back 
let the past die 
you ve done well in my absence 
on the field and off  i m told 
winning trophies  horses  women 
you put them in that order 
generally  with a few exceptions 
beautiful  isn t she 
a real thoroughbred trophy 
don t you think 
 you speak of her like a target 
 lsn t she 
no 
she is the arrow 
i ve begun negotiations
with her father 
i m to make her my bride 
she ll be saddled   
   and placed on my mantle 
target or arrow  it doesn t matter 
i will have her 
ulrich  ulrich  ulrich 
 how would you beat him 
 with a stick  while he slept 
but on a horse  with a lance 
that man is unbeatable 
hello there 
 you re sir ulrich von lichtenstein 
 yes 
you re my favorite knight 
when we joust  i always say i m you 
what are you doing in cheapside 
there s no parade today 
can you keep a secret 
i was born in cheapside 
just around the corner there 
 truly  sir ulrich 
 truly 
i only live just there 
how old are you 
 nine and one half 
 nine and one half 
i wonder if you remember a man 
though he may have died long ago 
he was as tall as a knight 
his name was john thatcher 
 of course i remember him 
 you do 
yes  he lives there still 
sometimes we see him sitting
at the window  but no one knows why 
what do you mean 
he s blind  sir 
is someone there 
if you re here for the net 
i m not done yet  come tomorrow 
who are you 
a knight 
my name   is ulrich 
ulrich  i hear that name
being chanted from the stadium 
what business have you here 
i have word  master thatcher 
word of your son 
of my william  well  come in  sir 
what word  does he live 
aye  he lives 
he is very well 
he wanted you to know   
   that he changed his stars
after all 
and has he followed his feet 
has he found his way home at last 
yes 
father 
oh  william  oh  my boy 
i should like to meet this wat 
and roland too

and what of women 
is there a certain one or many 
there is a certain one 
i should like to meet her too 
this leak won t do  father 
 not in a thatcher s chamber 
 lt s quite fitting for a blind one 
well  a thatcher i am 
i ll fix it 
alive  i thought he was dead 
which is mad   
alive  i thought he was dead 
which is mad   
   because he was also so strong 
very strong 
 geoff 
 jocelyn 
this day just gets better and better 
somebody die 
sir ulrich von lichtenstein 
adhemar   
   followed you last night 
to cheapside 
he saw your father 
will  they asked me for your patents 
they re waiting for you
in the lists to arrest you 
a dozen royal guards 
 they ll put you in the stocks 
 but i face adhemar in five minutes 
no  you forfeit 
they ve already marked it down 
saddle the horses 
they can arrest your baggage  not you 
halt 
so  what do you think   
   now that you know what i am 
to know what you are  william 
would take a lifetime 
one i am willing to give 
but now you must run 
run  and i will run with you 
jocelyn  i cannot run 
i am a knight  and i will
put myself to the hazard 
in your heart  not on paper 
and paper s what matters to them 
william  i love you 
i love you  you 
 i won t see you led to the stocks 
 but you ll see me run  no 
damn your pride  william 
it is only you that
will not see you run 
pride s the one thing they can t take 
but they can take it from you 
they can and they will 
oh  they will 
but love they cannot take 
and where will we live 
in my hovel 
 with the pigs inside in winter 
 yes  william  with the pigs 
with the pigs 
the poor can marry for love 
jocelyn  you speak of what
you do not know 
william  i beg you 
please 
run  do it for love 
roland  you would see me run 
and you  geoff 
i wish it too  with all
the pieces of my heart 
wat  you and i  we aren t runners 
yes 
william  today we are 
run  william 
i will not run 
i am a knight 
well  boys   
   all good things must come to an end 
let s end them together 
you will remove yourself
from this position of honor 
i am here to compete 
you are here to be arrested 
all right 
he that strives to touch a star   
   oft stumbles   
   at a simple straw 
you have been weighed 
you have been measured 
and you have been found wanting 
it s one loss or another   william 
in what world could you
have ever beaten me 
leave  roland 
let them have me 
god love you  william 
so do i 
go  disperse 
or i will fong you 
as jesus christ the nazarene
and his holy mother   
   the virgin mary are my witnesses 
i will fong you 
i will rip you  fist  pain 
i ll stick my fist and break you 
pain  lots of pain 
we re in trouble 
listen to me 
listen to me 
what a pair we make  huh 
both trying to hide who we are 
both unable to do so 
your men love you 
if i knew nothing else about you 
that would be enough 
but you also tilt
when you should withdraw 
that is knightly too 
release him 
he may appear to be
of humble origins   
   but my personal historians
have discovered   
   that he descends
from an ancient royal line 
this is my word 
and as such  is beyond contestation 
now   
   if i may repay the kindness
you once showed me 
take a knee 
by the power vested in me
by my father  king edward   
   and by all the witnesses here   
   i dub thee   
   sir william 
arise   sir william 
can you joust 
there s my tournament to finish 
now  are you fit to compete 
or shall the forfeit stand 
i m fit 
i shall have your opponent informed 
look for his shield on the lists 
at once 
thank you  my lord 
all hail prince edward 
my lords  my ladies   
   and all you other people 
i give you the son of philippe
de vitry  son of gilles    
 are you sure 
 yes 
it s nothing but spun sugar
and boot black 
it s a small target   
   but aim for his heart 
  doer of daring deeds   
   conqueror of countless kingdoms 
count   
   adhemar 
oh  god  i ll get the surgeon 
roland 
you re the surgeon 
come on 
he tipped it 
kate  get me back to one 
otherwise we forfeit 
dirty son of a bitch 
kate  i can t breathe 
i can t breathe 
as i said  thatcher 
in what world could you
have ever beaten me 
such a place does not exist 
she s here 
with your father 
change your stars 
let s dance  you and i 
it s two lances to none 
you must unhorse him or kill him 
it s the only way to win 
 you need more padding 
 no  leave it off 
i can t breathe with it on 
lance 
i can barely grip it 
damn 
lash it to my arm 
wat   
   lash it to me arm 
do it 
good people 
i missed my introduction 
but please   
   please  i pray you 
hear it now 
for i would lay rest   
   the grace in my tongue   
   and speak plain 
days like these   
   are far too rare to cheapen
with heavy handed words 
and so  i m afraid 
without any ado whatsoever  
excuse me  my lord 
here he is  one of your own 
born a stone s throw from
this very stadium   
   and here before you now 
the son of john thatcher   
   sir william thatcher 
that s your name 
sir william thatcher 
your father heard that 
godspeed  william 
william 
you have been weighed 
you ve been measured 
and you absolutely   
   have been found wanting 
welcome to the new world 
god save you  if it is right
that he should do so 
william 
yes 
he s won  he s won 
you beat him  will 
oh  william 
i m going to write this story
