i think that s my glass 
oh  i m absolutely certain of it 
my name is sandor szavost 
i m hungarian 
my name is alice harford 
i m american 
delighted to meet you  alice 
did you ever read the latin poet ovid
on the art of love 
didn t he wind up all by himself   
   crying his eyes out   
   in some place
with a very bad climate 
but he also had a good time first 
a very good time 
are you here
with anyone tonight  alice 
with my husband 
oh  how sad 
but then i m sure he s the sort of man
who wouldn t mind if we danced 
what do you do  alice 
well  at the moment   
   i m looking for a job 
i used to manage
an art gallery in soho 
but it went broke 
what a shame 
i have some friends in the art game 
perhaps i can be of some help 
thank you 
someone you know 
my   
   husband 
don t you think
one of the charms of marriage   
   is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties 
may i ask why a beautiful woman   
   who could have any man in this room 
wants to be married 
why wouldn t she 
is it as bad as that 
as good as that 
do you know nuala windsor 
no  and it s very lovely
to meet you both 
how do you spell nuala 
n u a l a 
you don t remember me  do you 
you were very kind to me once 
only once 
that sounds like a terrible oversight 
i was doing a photo session
in rockefeller plaza   
   on a very windy day    
  and you got something in your eye 
  just about half of fifth avenue 
you were such a gentleman 
you gave me your handkerchief   
   which was also clean 
well  that is the kind of hero
i can be sometimes 
you know why women used to get married 
don t you 
why don t you tell me 
it was the only way they could
lose their virginity   
   and be free to do
what they wanted with other men 
the ones they really wanted 
fascinating 
do you know what s so nice
about doctors 
usually a lot less than people imagine 
they always seem so   
   knowledgeable 
oh  they are very knowledgeable   
   about all sorts of things 
but i bet they work too hard 
just think of all they miss 
you re probably right 
ladies  where exactly are we going 
exactly 
where the rainbow ends 
where the rainbow ends 
don t you wanna go
where the rainbow ends 
now that depends where that is 
well  let s find out 
excuse me  ladies 
sorry  dr  harford 
could you come with me for a moment 
something for mr  ziegler 
fine 
to be continued 
yeah 
bill  thanks for coming 
we had a little accident here 
what happened 
well  she was   
she was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction 
what did she take 
a speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it 
it s heroin and coke 
heroin and coke 
anything else

i have to go 
you don t  you know 
yes  i do 
alice 
i must see you again 
  that s impossible 
  why 
because   
   i m married 
good morning  lisa 
good morning  doctor 
your mail 
good  please ask janelle
to bring me my coffee 
  sure 
  thank you 
  good morning  sarah 
  good morning  doctor 
    twas the night before christmas 
when all through the house   
   not a creature was stirring 
not even a mouse  
okay  that s fine 
you can put your gown on 
hold this for mommy 
  looking forward to christmas 
  yeah 
  does this hurt 
  yeah 
  right there 
  yeah 
daddy s gonna like that 
very good choice 
  before me   
   when i jump into my bed  
we should call the zieglers
and thank them for the party 
i ve taken care of that 
good 
so how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents 
let s do that tomorrow 
tell me something 
those two girls   
   at the party last night   
did you   
   by any chance   
   happen to   
   fuck them 
what 
what are you talking about 
i m talking about the two girls   
   that you were so blatantly
hitting on 
i wasn t hitting on anybody 
who were they 
they were just a couple of models 
and where did you disappear to
with them for so long 
wait a minute 
wait a minute 
i didn t disappear with anybody 
ziegler wasn t feeling too well   
   and i got called upstairs
to see him 
anyway  who was the guy
you were dancing with 
a friend of the zieglers 
what did he want 
what did he want 
what did he want 
sex   
   upstairs 
then and there 
is that all 
yeah  that was all 
just wanted to fuck my wife 
that s right 
well  i guess that s understandable 
understandable 
because you are a very   
   very beautiful woman 
wait  so   
   because i m a beautiful woman   
   the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me   
   is because he wants to fuck me 
is that what you re saying 
well  i don t think it s quite
that black and white   
   but i think we both know
what men are like 
so on that basis   
   i should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models 
there are exceptions 
and what makes you an exception 
what makes me an exception is that   
   i happen to be in love with you 
and because we re married   
   and because i would never
lie to you   
   or hurt you 
do you realize that
what you re saying   
   is that the only reason you
wouldn t fuck those models   
   is out of consideration for me 
not because you really
wouldn t want to 
let s just relax  alice 
this pot is making you aggressive 
no  it s not the pot  it s you 
why can t you ever give me
a straight fucking answer 
i was under the impression
that s what i was doing 
i don t even know
what we re arguing about here 
i m not arguing 
i m just trying to find out
where you re coming from 
where i m coming from 
let s say let s say  for example 
you have some gorgeous woman   
   standing in your office naked   
   and you re feeling her fucking tits 
now  what i wanna know   
i wanna know what you re thinking
about when you re squeezing them 
alice  i happen to be a doctor 
it s all very impersonal   
   and you know
there s always a nurse present 
so when you re feeling tits  it s
nothing more than your professionalism 
exactly 
sex is the last thing on my mind
when i m with a patient 
now  when she is having
her little titties squeezed   
   do you think she ever
has fantasies   
   about what handsome dr  bill s
dickie might be like 
come on  i can assure you
sex is the last thing   
   on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient s mind 
and what makes you so sure 
if for no better reason   
   because she s afraid of
what i might find 
okay  okay  so after you tell her that
everything s fine  what then 
what then 
i don t know  alice   
what then 
look  women don t   
they basically just don t
think like that 
millions of years of evolution  right 
right 
men have to stick it
every place they can   
   but for women  it is just about
security and commitment   
   and whatever the fuck else 
a little oversimplified  alice 
but yes  something like that 
if you men only knew 
what i do know is you got stoned 
you tried to pick a fight   
   and now you re trying
to make me jealous 
but you re not the jealous type 
are you 
no  i m not 
you ve never been jealous about me 
have you 
no  i haven t 
and why haven t you ever
been jealous about me 
well  i don t know  alice 
maybe because you re my wife 
maybe because you re
the mother of my child   
   and i know you would never
be unfaithful to me 
you are very  very sure of yourself   
   aren t you 
no 
i m sure of you 
do you think that s funny 
all right  fuck it 
now we get
the fucking laughing fit  right 
do you    
do you remember
last summer at cape cod 
yes 
do you remember one night
in the dining room   
   there was this young naval officer   
   and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers 
no 
the waiter brought him a message 
at which point he left 
nothing rings a bell 
no 
well   
   i first saw him
that morning in the lobby 
he was checking into the hotel   
   and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage   
   to the elevator 
he glanced at me as he walked past 
just a glance 
nothing more 
but i could hardly   
   move 
that afternoon   
   helena went to the movies
with her friend   
   and you and i made love 
and we made plans about our future   
   and we talked about helena 
and yet   
   at no time   
   was he ever   
   out of my mind 
and i thought if he wanted me   
   even if it was only   
   for one night   
   i was ready to give up everything 
you   
   helena   
   my whole fucking future 
everything 
and yet it was weird 
because at the same time   
   you were clearer to me than ever 
and at that moment  my love for you   
   was both   
   tender and sad 
i barely slept that night   
   and i woke up the next morning
in a panic 
i didn t know whether i was
afraid that he had left   
   or that he might still be there 
but by dinner   
   i realized he was gone   
   and i was   
   relieved 
hello 
yes  this is dr  harford 
when did it happen 
no  no  i have the address 
thank you 
lou nathanson just died 
i think i have to go over there
and show my face

your father was   
he was a very brave man 
oh  thank you 
how are you holding up 
i m a bit numb 
i don t think it s really sunk in yet 
would you like to sit down 
it s so unreal 
daddy had such a good day 
his mind was clear 
and he remembered so many things 
then he had a little dinner   
   and he said he felt like
taking a nap 
i went into the kitchen and talked
to rosa for half an hour at most   
   and when i went to see how he was   
   i just thought he was asleep 
then i realized he wasn t breathing 
marion  from what you ve said   
   i m sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep 
oh  god  i hope so 
i think i ve been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen   
   than his death itself 
have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives 
i tried to call my stepmother in london 
but she was out 
my boyfriend  carl 
is making some calls   
   and he ll be coming over soon

about anything except your father

you were having a nightmare 
oh  god

what time is it 
it s a little after 4 
  did you just get home 
  yes 
it took longer than i thought 
you must be exhausted 
come on  lie down  lie down 
what were you dreaming 
just these weird things 
what was it 
it was so weird 
tell me 
we were in a deserted city   
   and our clothes were gone 
we were naked   
   and i was terrified   
   and i felt ashamed 
oh  god   
and i was angry because
i thought it was your fault 
you rushed away to go
find clothes for us 
as soon as you were gone 
it was completely different 
i felt wonderful 
then i was lying
in a beautiful garden   
   stretched out naked
in the sunlight   
   and a man walked out of the woods 
he was the man from the hotel 
the one i told you about 
the naval officer 
he stared at me   
   and then he just laughed 
he just laughed at me 
but that s not the end   
   is it 
no 
why don t you tell me the rest of it 
it s too awful 
it s only a dream 
he was kissing me   
   and then we were making love 
then there were all these
other people around us   
   hundreds of them  everywhere 
everyone was fucking 
and then i   
i was fucking other men 
so many   
   i don t know how many i was with 
and i knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men   
   just fucking all these men 
i wanted to make fun of you   
   to laugh in your face 
and so i laughed as loud as i could 
that must have been
when you woke me up 
shit 
  hi 
  hi 
i ll just have a cup of coffee  please 
anything else 
no  thank you 
excuse me 
do you know when they get in
next door at the sonata cafe 
i think there s usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3 
i don t suppose  by any chance 
you know nick nightingale 
he s playing piano
over there right now 
nick nightingale 
sure  he comes in here 
look  maybe you can help me   
   because it s important that
i get in touch with him 
do you know where he s staying 
i don t know if he d want me
to give out his address 
it s okay  i m a doctor 
i m actually a very old friend of his 
well  doctor   
   he ll be playing there tonight 
can t it wait until then 
listen  to be perfectly honest   
   it s a medical matter 
some tests  i know he ll wanna
know about them as soon as possible 
excuse me 
hi  how can i help you 
can you please ring mr  nightingale s
room for me  nick nightingale 
i m sorry  sir  mr  nightingale

  no  i m afraid not 
when did he check out 
about 5 00 this morning 
  5 00 
  yes 
that s an early checkout  isn t it 
it is a little on the early side  yeah 
look   
   did you notice anything   
   i don t know   
   unusual about him when he left 
unusual 
  hey  you re not five o  are you 
  no 
no  i m an old friend of his 
really 
i m a doctor 
  well  bill    
  sure 
it s funny you should
ask that question  bill   
   because actually there was
something a little strange   
   about the way mr  nightingale left 
really  what was that 
he came in this morning 
about 4 30 a  m   
   with two men 
big guys 
they were very well dressed
and very well spoken 
but they weren t the kind of people
you d fool around with   
   if you know what i mean 
anyways   
   i noticed mr  nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek 
to be perfectly honest  i also
thought he looked a little scared 
scared 
yes  yes 
he said he wanted to check out 
and then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men 
the other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill 
when they came back  mr  nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope 
but they saw it and took it   
   and said that any mail
or messages for him   
   would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so 
and then they just
took him off in a car 
do you have any idea where they went 
no  not a clue 
well  anyway   
i certainly appreciate your help 
anytime  bill  bye

  no 
you feel like playing 
no  thanks 
you go ahead  i ll watch 
i was just   
listen   
   bill   
the reason i asked you
to come over is   
   i need to talk to you
about something 
sure 
it s a little bit awkward 
and i have to be completely frank 
what kind of problem are you having 
it isn t a medical problem 
actually   
   it concerns you 
bill   
i know what happened last night 
and i know what s been
going on since then 
and i think you just might   
   have the wrong idea
about one or two things 
i m sorry  victor  i   
what in the hell
are you talking about 
please  bill  no games 
i was there 
at the house 
i saw everything that went on 
bill   
what the hell did you think
you were doing 
i couldn t even begin to imagine   
   how you d even heard about it   
   let alone got yourself
through the door 
then i remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player   
   nick whatever the fuck his name was 
at my party 
and it didn t take much to
figure out the rest 
it wasn t nick s fault 
it was mine 
of course it was nick s fault 
if he hadn t mentioned it to you 
none of this would ve happened 
i recommended that cocksucker
to those people   
   and he s made me look like
a complete asshole 
victor   
what can i say 
i had   
   absolutely   
   no idea you were involved
in any way 
i know you didn t  bill 
but i also know that you   
you went to nick s hotel
this morning   
   and talked to the desk clerk 
how do you know that 
because i had you followed 
you had me followed 
okay  okay  i m sorry 
all right  i owe you an apology 
this was for your own good  believe me 
i know what the desk clerk told you 
but what he didn t tell you is   
   all they did was
put nick on a plane to seattle 
by now he s probably back
with his family   
   you know  banging mrs  nick 
the clerk said
he had a bruise on his face 
okay  he had a bruise on his face 
that s a hell of a lot less
than he deserves 
listen  bill  i don t think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night 
who do you think those people were 
those were not just
ordinary people there 
if i told you their names 
i m not gonna tell you their names   
   but if i did 
i don t think you d sleep so well 
was it the second password 
is that what gave me away 
yes  finally 
but not because you didn t know it 
it s because there was
no second password 
of course it didn t help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos   
   and you showed up in a taxi 
or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat   
   made out to you know who 
there was a   
there was a   
there was a woman there   
   who tried to warn me 
i know 
do you know who she was 
yes 
she was a hooker 
sorry  but   
   that s what she was 
a hooker 
bill   
   suppose i told you   
   that everything that
happened to you there   
   the threats  the girl s warnings   
   her last minute intervention   
   suppose i said that all of that   
   was staged 
that it was a kind of charade 
that it was fake 
fake 
yes  fake 
why would they do that 
why 
in plain words   
   to scare the living shit out of you 
to keep you quiet
about where you d been   
   and what you d seen 
have you seen this 
yes  i have 
i saw her body in the morgue 
was she the woman at the party 
yes 
she was 
victor   
   the woman lying dead in the morgue   
   was the woman at the party 
yes 
well  victor  maybe i m
missing something here 
you called it a fake  a charade 
do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade   
   ends with somebody turning up dead 
okay  bill  let s cut the bullshit 
all right 
you ve been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours 
you wanna know what kind of charade 
i ll tell you exactly what kind 
that whole play acted 
 take me  phony sacrifice   
   that you ve been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death 
nothing happened after you left
that hadn t happened to her before 
she got her brains fucked out  period 
when they took her home 
she was just fine   
   and the rest is in the paper 
she was a junkie  she od d 
there was nothing suspicious 
her door was locked from the inside 
the police are happy  end of story 
come on  it was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her 
remember  you told her so yourself 
you remember  the one with the
great tits who od d in my bathroom 
listen  bill  nobody killed anybody 
someone died  it happens all the time 
but life goes on 
it always does   
   until it doesn t 
but you know that  don t you 
i ll tell you everything 
i ll tell you everything 
helena s gonna be up soon

have to wait and see 
alice 
what do you think we should do 
what do i think we should do 
look  mommy 
hey 
what do i think 
i don t know 
i mean  maybe   
hey 
maybe i think   
   we should be grateful 
grateful   
   that we ve managed to
survive through all of our   
   adventures   
   whether they were real   
   or only a dream 
are you sure of that 
am i sure 
only as sure as i am   
   that the reality of one night   
   let alone that of a whole lifetime   
   can ever be the whole truth 
and no dream is ever   
   just a dream 
the important thing is   
   we re awake now   
   and hopefully   
   for a long time to come 
forever 
forever 
forever 
let s not use that word  you know 
it frightens me 
but i do love you   
   and you know   
   there is something very important   
   that we need
