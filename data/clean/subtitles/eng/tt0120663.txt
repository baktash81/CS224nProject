oh im absolutely certain of it
my name is sandor szavost
im hungarian
my name is alice harford
im american
delighted to meet you alice
did you ever read the latin poet ovid
on the art of love
didnt he wind up all by himself
crying his eyes out
in some place
with a very bad climate
but he also had a good time first
a very good time
are you here
with anyone tonight alice
with my husband
oh how sad
but then im sure hes the sort of man
who wouldnt mind if we danced
what do you do alice
well at the moment
im looking for a job
i used to manage
an art gallery in soho
but it went broke
what a shame
i have some friends in the art game
perhaps i can be of some help
thank you
someone you know
my
husband
dont you think
one of the charms of marriage
is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties
may i ask why a beautiful woman
who could have any man in this room
wants to be married
why wouldnt she
is it as bad as that
as good as that
do you know nuala windsor
no and its very lovely
to meet you both
how do you spell nuala
nuala
you dont remember me do you
you were very kind to me once
only once
that sounds like a terrible oversight
i was doing a photo session
in rockefeller plaza
on a very windy day
and you got something in your eye
just about half of fifth avenue
you were such a gentleman
you gave me your handkerchief
which was also clean
well that is the kind of hero
i can be sometimes
you know why women used to get married
dont you
why dont you tell me
it was the only way they could
lose their virginity
and be free to do
what they wanted with other men
the ones they really wanted
fascinating
do you know whats so nice
about doctors
usually a lot less than people imagine
they always seem so
knowledgeable
oh they are very knowledgeable
about all sorts of things
but i bet they work too hard
just think of all they miss
youre probably right
ladies where exactly are we going
exactly
where the rainbow ends
where the rainbow ends
dont you wanna go
where the rainbow ends
now that depends where that is
well lets find out
excuse me ladies
sorry dr harford
could you come with me for a moment
something for mr ziegler

to be continued
yeah

alice
i must see you again
thats impossible
why
because
im married
good morning lisa
good morning doctor
your mail
good please ask janelle
to bring me my coffee
sure
thank you
good morning sarah
good morning doctor
twas the night before christmas
when all through the house
not a creature was stirring
not even a mouse
okay thats fine
you can put your gown on
hold this for mommy
looking forward to christmas
yeah
does this hurt
yeah
right there
yeah
daddys gonna like that
very good choice
before me
when i jump into my bed
we should call the zieglers
and thank them for the party
ive taken care of that
good
so how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents
lets do that tomorrow
tell me something
those two girls
at the party last night
did you
by any chance
happen to
fuck them
what
what are you talking about
im talking about the two girls
that you were so blatantly
hitting on
i wasnt hitting on anybody
who were they
they were just a couple of models
and where did you disappear to
with them for so long
wait a minute
wait a minute
i didnt disappear with anybody
ziegler wasnt feeling too well
and i got called upstairs
to see him
anyway who was the guy
you were dancing with
a friend of the zieglers
what did he want
what did he want
what did he want
sex
upstairs
then and there
is that all
yeah that was all
just wanted to fuck my wife
thats right
well i guess thats understandable
understandable
because you are a very
very beautiful woman
wait so
because im a beautiful woman
the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me
is because he wants to fuck me
is that what youre saying
well i dont think its quite
that black and white
but i think we both know
what men are like
so on that basis
i should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models
there are exceptions
and what makes you an exception
what makes me an exception is that
i happen to be in love with you
and because were married
and because i would never
lie to you
or hurt you
do you realize that
what youre saying
is that the only reason you
wouldnt fuck those models
is out of consideration for me
not because you really
wouldnt want to
lets just relax alice
this pot is making you aggressive
no its not the pot its you
why cant you ever give me
a straight fucking answer
i was under the impression
thats what i was doing
i dont even know
what were arguing about here
im not arguing
im just trying to find out
where youre coming from
where im coming from
lets saylets say for example
you have some gorgeous woman
standing in your office naked
and youre feeling her fucking tits
now what i wanna know
i wanna know what youre thinking
about when youre squeezing them
alice i happen to be a doctor
its all very impersonal
and you know
theres always a nurse present
so when youre feeling tits its
nothing more than your professionalism
exactly
sex is the last thing on my mind
when im with a patient
now when she is having
her little titties squeezed
do you think she ever
has fantasies
about what handsome dr bills
dickie might be like
come on i can assure you
sex is the last thing
on this fucking hypothetical
woman patients mind
and what makes you so sure
if for no better reason
because shes afraid of
what i might find
okay okay so after you tell her that
everythings fine what then
what then
i dont know alice
what then
look women dont
they basically just dont
think like that
millions of years of evolution right
right
men have to stick it
every place they can
but for women it is just about
security and commitment
and whatever the fuck else
a little oversimplified alice
but yes something like that
if you men only knew
what i do know is you got stoned
you tried to pick a fight
and now youre trying
to make me jealous
but youre not the jealous type
are you
no im not
youve never been jealous about me
have you
no i havent
and why havent you ever
been jealous about me
well i dont know alice
maybe because youre my wife
maybe because youre
the mother of my child
and i know you would never
be unfaithful to me
you are very very sure of yourself
arent you
no
im sure of you
do you think thats funny
all right fuck it
now we get
the fucking laughing fit right
do you
do you remember
last summer at cape cod
yes
do you remember one night
in the dining room
there was this young naval officer
and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers
no
the waiter brought him a message
at which point he left
nothing rings a bell
no
well
i first saw him
that morning in the lobby
he was checking into the hotel
and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage
to the elevator
he glanced at me as he walked past
just a glance
nothing more
but i could hardly
move
that afternoon
helena went to the movies
with her friend
and you and i made love
and we made plans about our future
and we talked about helena
and yet
at no time
was he ever
out of my mind
and i thought if he wanted me
even if it was only
for one night
i was ready to give up everything
you
helena
my whole fucking future
everything
and yet it was weird
because at the same time
you were clearer to me than ever
and at that moment my love for you
was both
tender and sad
i barely slept that night
and i woke up the next morning
in a panic
i didnt know whether i was
afraid that he had left
or that he might still be there
but by dinner
i realized he was gone
and i was
relieved
hello
yes this is dr harford
when did it happen

daddy had such a good day
his mind was clear
and he remembered so many things
then he had a little dinner
and he said he felt like
taking a nap
i went into the kitchen and talked
to rosa for half an hour at most
and when i went to see how he was
i just thought he was asleep
then i realized he wasnt breathing
marion from what youve said
im sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep
oh god i hope so
i think ive been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen
than his death itself

we were in a deserted city
and our clothes were gone
we were naked
and i was terrified
and i felt ashamed
oh god
and i was angry because
i thought it was your fault
you rushed away to go
find clothes for us
as soon as you were gone
it was completely different
i felt wonderful
then i was lying
in a beautiful garden
stretched out naked
in the sunlight
and a man walked out of the woods
he was the man from the hotel
the one i told you about
the naval officer
he stared at me
and then he just laughed
he just laughed at me
but thats not the end
is it
no
why dont you tell me the rest of it
its too awful
its only a dream
he was kissing me
and then we were making love
then there were all these
other people around us
hundreds of them everywhere
everyone was fucking
and then i
i was fucking other men
so many
i dont know how many i was with
and i knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men
just fucking all these men
i wanted to make fun of you
to laugh in your face
and so i laughed as loud as i could
that must have been
when you woke me up

something a little strange
about the way mr nightingale left
really what was that
he came in this morning
about 430 a m
with two men
big guys
they were very welldressed
and very wellspoken
but they werent the kind of people
youd fool around with
if you know what i mean
anyways
i noticed mr nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek
to be perfectly honest i also
thought he looked a little scared
scared
yes yes
he said he wanted to check out
and then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men
the other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill
when they came back mr nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope
but they saw it and took it
and said that any mail
or messages for him
would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so
and then they just
took him off in a car
do you have any idea where they went
no not a clue

bill
the reason i asked you
to come over is
i need to talk to you
about something
sure
its a little bit awkward
and i have to be completely frank
what kind of problem are you having
it isnt a medical problem
actually
it concerns you
bill
i know what happened last night
and i know whats been
going on since then
and i think you just might
have the wrong idea
about one or two things
im sorry victor i
what in the hell
are you talking about
please bill no games
i was there
at the house
i saw everything that went on
bill
what the hell did you think
you were doing
i couldnt even begin to imagine
how youd even heard about it
let alone got yourself
through the door
then i remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player
nick whatever the fuck his name was
at my party
and it didnt take much to
figure out the rest
it wasnt nicks fault
it was mine
of course it was nicks fault
if he hadnt mentioned it to you
none of this wouldve happened
i recommended that cocksucker
to those people
and hes made me look like
a complete asshole
victor
what can i say
i had
absolutely
no idea you were involved
in any way
i know you didnt bill
but i also know that you
you went to nicks hotel
this morning
and talked to the desk clerk
how do you know that
because i had you followed
you had me followed
okay okay im sorry
all right i owe you an apology
this was for your own good believe me
i know what the desk clerk told you
but what he didnt tell you is
all they did was
put nick on a plane to seattle
by now hes probably back
with his family
you know banging mrs nick
the clerk said
he had a bruise on his face
okay he had a bruise on his face
thats a hell of a lot less
than he deserves
listen bill i dont think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night
who do you think those people were
those were not just
ordinary people there
if i told you their names
im not gonna tell you their names
but if i did
i dont think youd sleep so well
was it the second password
is that what gave me away
yes finally
but not because you didnt know it
its because there was
no second password
of course it didnt help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos
and you showed up in a taxi
or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat
made out to youknowwho
there was a
there was a
there was a woman there
who tried to warn me
i know
do you know who she was
yes
she was a hooker
sorry but
thats what she was
a hooker
bill
suppose i told you
that everything that
happened to you there
the threats the girls warnings
her lastminute intervention
suppose i said that all of that
was staged
that it was a kind of charade
that it was fake
fake
yes fake
why would they do that
why
in plain words
to scare the living shit out of you
to keep you quiet
about where youd been
and what youd seen
have you seen this
yes i have
i saw her body in the morgue
was she the woman at the party
yes
she was
victor
the woman lying dead in the morgue
was the woman at the party
yes
well victor maybe im
missing something here
you called it a fake a charade
do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade
ends with somebody turning up dead
okay bill lets cut the bullshit
all right
youve been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours
you wanna know what kind of charade
ill tell you exactly what kind
that whole playacted
take me phony sacrifice
that youve been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death
nothing happened after you left
that hadnt happened to her before
she got her brains fucked out period
when they took her home
she was just fine
and the rest is in the paper
she was a junkie she odd
there was nothing suspicious
her door was locked from the inside
the police are happy end of story
come on it was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her
remember you told her so yourself
you remember the one with the
great tits who odd in my bathroom
listen bill nobody killed anybody
someone died it happens all the time
but life goes on
it always does
until it doesnt
but you know that dont you
ill tell you everything
ill tell you everything

have to wait and see
alice
what do you think we should do
what do i think we should do
look mommy
hey
what do i think
i dont know
i mean maybe
hey
maybe i think
we should be grateful
grateful
that weve managed to
survive through all of our
adventures
whether they were real
or only a dream
are you sure of that
am i sure
only as sure as i am
that the reality of one night
let alone that of a whole lifetime
can ever be the whole truth
and no dream is ever
just a dream
the important thing is
were awake now
and hopefully
for a long time to come
forever
forever
forever

it frightens me
but i do love you
and you know
there is something very important
that we need
