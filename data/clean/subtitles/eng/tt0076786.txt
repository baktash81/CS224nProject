we expected you yesterday evening 
you wrote us that

last night about 10 00 
but the door was locked 
and somebody on the call box   
said they didn t know who
i was and couldn t let me in 
  who said that to you 
  i don t know  she didn t say her name 
i m so sorry  at any rate 
now you re here among us 
so welcome to our academy  i m miss
tanner  one of the instructors 
nice to meet you 
come along  i d like to
introduce you to madame blanc 
our vice directress 
she was a very famous ballerina 
  madame blanc 
  yes 
suzy bannion  our new student 
oh  yes 
  excuse me  gentlemen 
  of course  madame 
you re pretty  very pretty
indeed  they re policemen 
i knew a woman called bannion years
ago in new york  carol bannion 
  she s my aunt 
  good  she s a marvelous woman 
a friend and benefactress
of artists everywhere 
i m delighted to have her niece here 
well  i offer our academy s official
welcome in the name of our directress 
who unfortunately is not
here at the moment 
  she s traveling abroad 
  thank you 
albert  please wait for me upstairs 
he s my nephew  i m very attached to him 
i must tell you what i
have to say very quickly   
because those gentlemen
are waiting for me 
something terrible  truly
horrible  has happened 
one of our students  pat hingle  who was
expelled just yesterday for improper conduct 
was murdered last night by some
madman  it s a frightening story 
but i always warn our students 
don t i  miss tanner 
i tell them to be careful  not to get
involved with questionable friendships 
what i wanted to tell you was that
your room here isn t free yet 
  just a slight hitch 
  yes  but don t worry 
we ve found you a place to stay with one of
our third year students who lives in town 
you ll have to pay 50 of your
american dollars a week 
but it s a good price  and you can
deduct it from your fee here 
now i entrust you to the care of miss tanner 
one of our veteran teachers here 
don t be upset if she seems a little stern or surly 
it s only her manner  she s even that way with me 
she really is an invaluable teacher 
  come with me 
  and now  gentlemen 
as you know  our courses last three years 
and you must pass an exam
at the end of each year 
so  the girl left the school
about 11 00 in the evening 
  that s my information 
  excuse me 
when i got here last night about 11 00 
i saw a girl leaving the school 
she s a new student  she just
arrived  what did she look like 
well  she had blonde hair and
was wearing a brown raincoat 
  what did she do 
  i don t know  i only saw her for a minute in a storm 
so you see  it really was 11 00 
coming 
we don t teach you how to dance here 
because we presume our students already know how 
this is an established academy
dedicated to specializing 
this is pavlos  our general handyman 
he s really ugly  isn t he 
don t be afraid to say so 
he can t understand you  anyway 
he speaks only romanian 
you see that gorgeous smile  he s been very
handsome ever since he got those false teeth 
last year  he discovered he
had gingivitis of the gums 
so he had all his teeth pulled 
the top row one morning 
the bottom row a day later 
bang 
  where are we going 
  to the locker room 
we also have a swimming pool 
which you can use when you want 
miss tanner  i have something to tell you 
  squawk  squawk  polly parrot 
  who said that  shut up 
that s enough of these little
games for the moment 
i want to introduce suzy bannion  our new student

oh  excuse me 
i m sorry 
oh  it s okay  it doesn t matter 
did they shake you up with all
that talk about money 
well  i m not exactly used to it 
same with me at first 
then i found out it s a
charming habit around here 
i once read that names   
which begin with the letter  s    
are the names of snakes 
next year  after i finish the course 
i ve got an offer from the
state school of ballet in geneva 
what about you 
well  i ll go back to yhe states

even if i have the name of a snake 
i was just kidding

no 
hello 
oh  hi  no  no  no 
you did the right thing 
  hi 
  hi 
oh  you didn t have to bring these over here

  ciao 
  ciao

  no  thanks  i can t 
i live at the school  so i ve got to

bye 
no  go on 
uh huh  i know 
you caught one  yes  yes  i can
hear you very well 
didn t you see how he was blushing 
he s cute  except he doesn t have any  um 
and he never has enough money
for room and board at school 
that s why that bitch tanner
has got him under her thumb 
she gives him 1 001 errands to do 
sure 
i got it  okay 
call me back tomorrow evening 
give me a chance to think it over 
yes  yes  okay  okay 
anyway  he is cute 
poor pat  she liked him a lot 
that poor kid  ending up like that 
i can t even think about it 
i heard you saw her yesterday evening 
uh huh  outside the school 
she was acting very strange 
mumbling to herself 
she really felt terrible when they kicked
her out  but she really deserved it 
  there was so much noise 
  god  was she difficult 
she was saying things that made no sense 
she was always arguing  causing trouble 
 secret   
 iris   
what 
uh  i remember   
she mentioned the word  secret   
and then she    mentioned a flower 
iris  i think  or a lilac 
secret flowers  what s
that supposed to mean 
i don t know  she was a busybody 
it would ve been easy for her to
find out one of us was in a jam 
  how do you like it at olga s 
  it s nice 
those eight on the list this morning 
come with me to the yellow room 
good morning  miss tanner  suzy 
  good morning  madame blanc 
  i ve got good news for you 
we have it all arranged 
your room is ready for you 
isn t that marvelous  you can
move in today  if you like 
but i d rather stay at olga s  if it s okay 
doesn t matter to me  my dear 
but in your letter of enrollment  you
said you d be boarding at the school 
  i know  but 
  the room is free now 
  well  i didn t think it was so important 
  as you wish 
if that s what you want  so be it 
sara 
i had no idea you were so strong willed 
i see that when you make up
your mind about something 
nothing will change it for you 
my compliments 
witch 
and then  toward the end of the 19th century 
the technique of classical ballet   
assumed a different  more stylized impostation 
all right  let s warm up 
what s wrong  don t you feel well 
no  it s nothing  i just feel a little weak 
if it gets any worse  i ll just stop 
and now some exercises 
daniel  you may begin 
one  two  three and four 
and one and two   
and three and four 
and one and two   
and three and four 
  and one 
  i m sorry  miss tanner 
i feel a little weak  can i
just rest for a second 
weak  come on  it s an easy step 
this is the first time we ve worked together 
i want to see what you can do 
how far along you are 
now  come along and join the others 
come on  let s go 
daniel 
all together now 
and one and two   
and three and four 
  i can t  please 
  and one and two   
and three and four 
and one and two and three and four 
and one and two and three and four 
pay attention  suzy  get those legs

and one and two and three and four 
come on  come on  run along 
come on  drink up 
  oh  you you must drink 
  no  that s enough 
you heard what the doctor said 
  drink up 
  no 
you must drink 
the blood that was hemorrhaging is
going back with the intake of liquids 
  right  professor verdegast 
  obviously 
my dear madame 
do not be concerned  it s nothing 
as i ve already told the young lady 
that s a relief  professor 
how do you feel  dear 
  uh  better 
  the fault lies with your exercises 
when somebody s been out of practice  violent
movement could cause tiny tears in internal ligaments 
thus the hemorrhaging 
you look better already  you ve
even got color back in your cheeks 
  isn t that right 
  oh  yes  she looks much better 
  ow 
  hold still 
this will get you back into shape in no time 
here we are  fine  fine  a day or two 
you ll be on your feet  as good as new 
  who brought my bags here 
  olga  what a dear 
the minute she heard you were ill  she
went right home and brought your things 
oh  and she also left me your  50 
and she didn t take a penny of it 
why why did she do that 
  if i wanted to  i would 
  well  my dear 
what you need now is
some peace and quiet 
if the hemorrhaging should start
again  which is very improbable 
you can telephone me 
and tanner  she is to eat
bland food for about a week 
and you mustn t let
her have any fruit 
  a drop of vin rose 
  yes 
good  a glass of red wine with
each meal  it works miracles 
clears up anemia and strengthens
red corpuscles  it builds the blood 
rest well  you re in good hands 
suzy  we re next door neighbors 
so  you moved in here 
well  they moved me in here 
i really didn t want to 
you know  as soon as i got sick 
your pal olga ran and got my bags   
and threw me out of her place 
she must ve thought i had
something awfully contagious 
but i can t stand to live in a
boarding school like a ten year old 
oh  wow  you come back strong 
yeah  you know  i feel really well 
i mean  it s almost as if nothing
had happened  it s incredible 
  and all thanks to professor verdegast 
  verdegast 
  he came to look at you 
  yeah 
come in 
hi  pavlos 
thank you 
you d better keep an eye on that
lighter  he really likes it 
yes  but i don t think he s a thief 
at least you know 
  are you eating up here 
  yeah  they put me on a restricted diet 
and on a restricted diet  they give you wine 
that s professor verdegast s idea 
says it ll build up my blood 
the bell  oh  god  that means
it s only 15 minutes till supper 
i d better change 
  ciao  see you later 
  okay 
where  where 
everywhere  the whole floor 
it s disgusting  it s disgusting 
  where are they coming from 
  i don t know  let s go and see 
  they re coming from the ceiling 
  in the meantime  everybody downstairs 
don t let anyone come up 
i m sorry  truly mortified 
please excuse me 
but it was nothing to do
with you  madame 
no  of course not  girls 
it was not madame blanc s fault 
we ordered those cases
of food by mail   
from a reliable firm that
we thought to be honest 
obviously  it arrived spoiled 
in a few days  time 
you see what happened 
  oh  it was awful 
  yes  one got in my mouth 
i suppose we re fortunate those things
only reached the floor below the attic 
  are the other floors all right 
  yes  we checked them out 
just the floor where the
students  rooms are 
well  i ll take care of the problem
of fumigating in the morning 
in the meantime  for tonight  i ve
thought of a makeshift arrangement 
go and see how they re getting
along  will you  dear 
the boys have kindly offered to help 
and they and the servants are turning
the practice hall into a dormitory 
if some of you choose to find hotel
rooms  i ll have no objections 
but it s already late 
and in any case 
the inconvenience will only
be for one night 
we ll all sleep together 
  bravo 
  you all right 
  yes  thank you 
  fine 
  is everything all right 
  yes  thank you 
  good 
  are you all right 
yes  madame blanc  thank you 
  oh  it s very comfortable  just like being in camp 
  good 
are you sleeping here with
us  too  madame blanc 
certainly  as are all the other
teachers and miss tanner 
do the teachers live here at school 
no  they live in town 
they leave after supper at
9 30  just like clockwork 
it s very late  you won t be afraid
if i turn out the lights 
  good night  everyone 
  good night  good night 
is that guy hot for you 
  maybe 
  that s funny 
i heard he was  uh 
  of course  i m not much of a gossip 
  that s a good one 
come on  you tried to get
him and didn t make it 
  you liar  that s not 
  why don t you two shut up 
some of us want to go to sleep 
hey  sara  forget it  it s okay 
suzy  are you asleep 
  were you sleeping 
  no  what s the matter 
you hear that snoring 
it s weird 
hear it 
where do you think it s coming from 
behind the sheet 
lies 
what 
they lied to us 
the directress is here 
that s her  the one who s snoring 
she s the directress 
  how do you know 
  i m sure it s her 
last year  for a while 
i lived in one of the guest rooms   
under the top of the stairs 
one night 
i heard someone coming very late in 
getting into bed in the room next to mine 
and then 
then i heard this weird kind of snoring 
i tell you  it was so weird
i never forgot it 
listen 
you hear that whistle 
it s exactly the same 
the next morning  madame blanc told me   
that the directress had spent
a few hours at the school   
and had slept in the room next to mine 
you see 
so i know she s the directress 
she s here 
she s there 
right behind that sheet 
thank you  i m grateful you can take
care of the fumigating so promptly 
  good morning  madame blanc 
  good morning  daniel 
  is everything in order now 
  all cleaned up  madame 
just to be sure  we checked
the other floors too 
miss tanner  excuse me 
did the directress sleep
here last night 
  no  she didn t  good morning  daniel 
  good morning 
you know she s away on a trip  maybe
she ll pay us a visit two weeks from now 
excuse me  miss tanner  but which
class do i attend this morning

thank you 
stop

  do you know what happened  do you know 
  what day is it 
your lousy  disgusting
dog has bitten albert 
he took a piece out
of albert s arm 
  what 
  did you all hear that 
that miserable dog tried
to mutilate a child 
madame blanc had to rush albert to
a first aid center to have stitches put in 
  that s impossible 
  let s go to the first aid center 
even if you can t see the blood  at least
you can hear the poor child s crying 
that s enough now 
my dog s a peaceful  faithful
animal  he s never hurt anyone 
the boy must have done
something to him first 
oh  the poor little animal 
the poor little puppy 
if i ever see him within a mile of this
school again  i ll have him put to death 
stop it 
i won t allow such talk  you understand 
you won t allow it 
then get out  you and your dog 
  get moving 
  you bitch

i m going  i m going 
but try to understand that 
that i m blind  not deaf 
get it  huh 
not deaf 
not deaf  you understand that

ahh  fresh air 
let me out of this gilded parade 
get out  get out of here  good riddance 
oh  pavlos  how much longer

hey  listen 
there they go  right on schedule 
the teachers  remember 
can you hear them 
they re going away 
you hear them 
yes 
i 
i  i don t think they ll
even miss school 
what  what did you say 
wake up 
i said  it doesn t seem to
me that they re going out 
a front door is on the left 
their footsteps are going to the
right  somewhere inside the school 
jesus  suzy 
  you re a genius 
  mmm 
fantastic 
how come i never noticed that before 
suzy  if they don t leave 
where do they go 
wake up  suzy 
come on  wake up  suzy 
i m so sleepy 
i don t know why  i m sorry 
maybe 
maybe we can find out where they really go 
of course 
yes 
begin to count the steps as they go 
it s like the search of alietne 
easy 
what is it  huh 
come on 
come on  let s go home 
who is that  who s there 
easy  boy 
what is it 
what s happening 
who s there 
who s there 
wait 
poor daniel  torn to pieces  incredible 
oh  yeah  but you can never put
too much trust in wolfhounds 
they re crazy  we had two of them
once at the villa in gestaad 
my god  first pat gets
murdered by a madman 
and now daniel is killed by his dog 
yeah  maybe there s a hex on the place 
yeah  let s call in the exorcist
and have it purged 
  what is it  is something wrong 
  no  everything s all right 
is it something personal  dear 
no  no  it s nothing like that 
miss tanner  would you mind 
i d like a few minutes
alone with suzy 
well  what is it 
i just wanted to talk to you about some of
the things that have been happening lately 
oh  i know you re upset by daniel s
death  as we all have been 
no  but it s more than that 
does anybody know anything
about who killed pat 
i spoke with the chief of
police just this morning 
he told me they had
some definite clues 
  you know that i saw her the night i arrived here 
  yes  you told me that 
and that she was mumbling some
strange  unrelated words 
no  you didn t tell me that 
because it was something that didn t
make any sense  it was in a thunderstorm 
i just didn t pay much attention to it 
i only caught two words distinctly 
 secret  and  irises   
i don t know what they mean  but
i thought they might be important 
you ve done very well  congratulations 
i don t know what the words
 secret  or  irises  mean either 
but i think it s only right we should
let the police know about it 
i m only amazed you waited
two days before  hello 
  you really messed things up 
  what are you talking about 
because    maybe pat was talking to   
someone just inside the building that night 
and we know that someone
wasn t one of the teachers 
come on 
now you ve put them
on the hunt for somebody 
what difference does that make to you 
big difference 
because i was pat s friend 
she was telling me something
when you suddenly showed up 
she got scared and she ran away 
she was in hysterics almost 
and then she was killed 
remember that voice when you rang the bell 
well  that was me 
i heard strange  incredible  absurd things 
pat was taking notes on them for months 
and before going away 
she gave me all the notes 
i ve only told one person 
a very good friend of mine 
frank mandel  he s here
for a convention 
i ll let you read them tonight 
suzy  wake up  please  wake up 
the notes are gone  someone
stole them from me 
you understand  they disappeared 
don t fall asleep  please help me 
  wake up  help me 
  i can t 
can t 
this is the only thing i got left 
and that s because i kept it on me  look 
  look 
  what is it 
what s the matter with you  don t
you remember  what s going on 
this is the key that ll get us
wherever the teachers go every night 
i thought it out yesterday evening
while i was sitting here next to you 
suzy  do you know
anything about witches 
oh  no  please 
don t leave me alone 
i must get away 
wait 
wait 
wait  wait  wait  wait 
looking for sara  she s disappeared 
but that s impossible  i just
talked to her last night 
she left this morning  as a matter
of fact  without telling anyone 
just packed her bags and left  she
was heard leaving about 6 00 
  you heard her leave  didn t you 
  sara  oh  yes 
i heard the door close and her
footsteps going down the hall 
and then i heard a car driving off down the
street  i guess someone was waiting for her 
  but it s impossible 
  if she wasn t happy here  she could ve told someone 
why sneak off like a thief 
hello  may i speak to frank
mandel  please  yes  thank you 
hello  this is suzy bannion 
no  we ve never met  i m a
friend of sara s 
yes  hello  do you happen to
know where sara is 
well  she disappeared from
school this morning 
yes  it seems she left and
took all her luggage 
yes  uh  listen  could i see
you sometime today 
well  i m really worried about her 
oh  great  where 
at the convention center 
okay  i ll see you there 
she didn t inform any of her classmates 
i ve already asked all of them 
it s very upsetting  i can t
understand why she did it 
i m the one who s held responsible
by their families 
i ll call her father in geneva 
perhaps she might have gone there 
i ve already phoned sara s father 
he s the italian consul in geneva 
but he wasn t there today 
he was away for the weekend 
they said he d be back by monday  and
they don t know anything about her there 
well  do you understand
why i m so worried 
yes  but before we both get upset 
let s wait for the father s return 
maybe they got together this morning
and went off on their own 
i know her quite well  she was a
patient of mine three years ago 
  were you aware of that 
  no  i didn t even know you were a psychiatrist 
well  she had a nervous breakdown
after her mother s death 
and she came to me for treatment 
after she got better again 
we remained friends 
but lately she was upset about some notions
put into her head by a friend of hers 
  not you  i hope 
  no 
they were kind of wild ideas 
she had discovered that the
tam academy was founded   
in 1895 by a certain helena markos 
a greek immigrant 
and that the local people
believed her to be a witch 
  i guess you knew that 
  no  but i have a strange feeling   
that somebody already told me
about it or something similar 
i can t can t remember 
well  that really got sara s imagination
going  earlier in the 19th century 
the markos woman had been expelled
from several european countries 
she seemed to have something about her
which urged religious people to persecute her 
she also wrote a number of books  and
i read that among the initiated 
she went by the name  the black queen   
after she settled down here  she became
the subject of a lot of gossip 
nevertheless  she managed to put
her hands on a great deal of money 
and she founded the tam academy 
at first a sort of school of
dance and occult sciences 
but that didn t last long 
because in 1905 
after being hounded and
cursed at for ten years 
madame markos died in a fire 
that s all there is  as far
as witchcraft is concerned 
the school was taken over by her favorite
pupil  the study of the occult was abandoned 
and soon the place became
the famous dance academy 
but what does it mean to be a witch 
well  as a believer in the material
world and a psychiatrist to boot 
i m convinced that the current spread
of belief in magic and the occult   
is part of mental illness 
bad luck isn t brought by broken
mirrors  but by broken minds 
excuse me  milius 
professor milius can answer your
question better than i can 
he wrote a book called paranoia
or magic  and believe me 
it s the final word on the subject 
excuse me  milius  if you don t mind 
i d like you to meet a friend of mine 
  fraulein 
  she s interested in your favorite subject 
witches 
can you tell her something
about the mysterious 
well  i have to go  i have an
appointment to keep 
keep me posted  hmm 
hello  i m sorry to bother you 
ah  so  what would you like to know 
  do you believe in the existence of witches 
  ah 
i have known some women who
are said to be witches 
  really 
  i have studied the phenomenon for a long time 
i am of the opinion that
it is an important appendage   
of contemporary psychiatry 
you re skeptical  my dear 
well  frankly  it is a little
hard to believe 
  what do witches do 
  they are malefic  negative and destructive 
their knowledge of the art of the occult
gives them tremendous powers 
they can change the course of events and
people s lives  but only to do harm 
  you don t believe me 
  no  i 
their goal is to accumulate
great personal wealth 
but that can only be achieved
by injury to others 
they can cause suffering 
sickness and even the death   
of those who  for whatever
reason  have offended them 
why do you have all this
interest in the occult 
because some friends spoke
to me about witches 
i read some stuff 
have you ever heard of helena markos 
oh  yes  she was a very
famous black queen 
a powerful witch with a tremendous
talent for doing evil 
a real mistress of magic 
she lived and died in the city 
did you know that 
yes  and might there exist
a guild of witches 
the correct term would
be a coven of witches 
a woman becomes queen of her magic
is a hundred times more powerful   
than the rest of the coven 
which is like a serpent 
its strength rests with its leader 
that is  with its head 
a coven deprived of its leader
is like a headless cobra 
harmless 
skepticism is the natural
reaction of people nowadays 
but magic is ever present 
in other words 
which means that magic is everywhere 
and all over the world 
it s a recognized fact 
always 
mark  mark 
excuse me  where is everybody 
they have all gone to the theater
for the opening of the bolshoi 
  then why didn t anyone tell me about it 
  i don t know 
miss tanner obtained
tickets for everyone

footsteps are going to the right

footsteps stop here
