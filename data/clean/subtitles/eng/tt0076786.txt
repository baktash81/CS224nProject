madman its a frightening story

involved with questionable friendships
what i wanted to tell you was that
your room here isnt free yet
just a slight hitch

weve found you a place to stay with one of
our thirdyear students who lives in town
youll have to pay 50 of your
american dollars a week

deduct it from your fee here

i saw a girl leaving the school
shes a new student she just
arrived what did she look like

was wearing a brown raincoat
what did she do
i dont know i only saw her for a minute in a storm
so you see it really was 1100

because we presume our students already know how
this is an established academy
dedicated to specializing
this is pavlos our general handyman
hes really ugly isnt he

he cant understand you anyway
he speaks only romanian
you see that gorgeous smile hes been very
handsome ever since he got those false teeth

she was saying things that made no sense
she was always arguing causing trouble
secret
iris
what
uh i remember
she mentioned the word secret
and then she mentioned a flower
iris i think or a lilac

the room is free now
well i didnt think it was so important

sara

i see that when you make up
your mind about something
nothing will change it for you
my compliments
witch
and then toward the end of the 19th century
the technique of classical ballet
assumed a different more stylized impostation

you must drink
the blood that was hemorrhaging is
going back with the intake of liquids
right professor verdegast
obviously
my dear madame
do not be concerned its nothing
as ive already told the young lady
thats a relief professor
how do you feel dear
uh better
the fault lies with your exercises
when somebodys been out of practice violent
movement could cause tiny tears in internal ligaments
thus the hemorrhaging
you look better already youve
even got color back in your cheeks
isnt that right
oh yes she looks much better
ow
hold still
this will get you back into shape in no time
here we are fine fine a day or two
youll be on your feet as good as new
who brought my bags here
olga what a dear
the minute she heard you were ill she
went right home and brought your things
oh and she also left me your 50
and she didnt take a penny of it
whywhy did she do that
if i wanted to i would
well my dear
what you need now is
some peace and quiet
if the hemorrhaging should start
again which is very improbable
you can telephone me
and tanner she is to eat
bland food for about a week
and you mustnt let
her have any fruit
a drop of vin rose
yes
good a glass of red wine with
each meal it works miracles
clears up anemia and strengthens
red corpuscles it builds the blood
rest well youre in good hands
suzy were nextdoor neighbors
so you moved in here
well they moved me in here
i really didnt want to
you know as soon as i got sick
your pal olga ran and got my bags
and threw me out of her place
she mustve thought i had
something awfully contagious
but i cant stand to live in a
boarding school like a tenyearold
oh wow you come back strong
yeah you know i feel really well
i mean its almost as if nothing
had happened its incredible
and all thanks to professor verdegast
verdegast
he came to look at you
yeah
come in
hi pavlos
thank you
youd better keep an eye on that
lighter he really likes it
yes but i dont think hes a thief
at least you know
are you eating up here
yeah they put me on a restricted diet
and on a restricted diet they give you wine
thats professor verdegasts idea
says itll build up my blood

theyre crazy we had two of them
once at the villa in gestaad
my god first pat gets
murdered by a madman
and now daniel is killed by his dog
yeah maybe theres a hex on the place
yeah lets call in the exorcist
and have it purged
what is it is something wrong
no everythings all right
is it something personal dear
no no its nothing like that
miss tanner would you mind
id like a few minutes
alone with suzy
well what is it
i just wanted to talk to you about some of
the things that have been happening lately
oh i know youre upset by daniels
death as we all have been
no but its more than that
does anybody know anything
about who killed pat
i spoke with the chief of
police just this morning
he told me they had
some definite clues
you know that i saw her the night i arrived here
yes you told me that
and that she was mumbling some
strange unrelated words
no you didnt tell me that
because it was something that didnt
make any sense it was in a thunderstorm
i just didnt pay much attention to it
i only caught two words distinctly
secret and irises
i dont know what they mean but
i thought they might be important
youve done very well congratulations
i dont know what the words
secret or irises mean either
but i think its only right we should
let the police know about it
im only amazed you waited
two days before hello
you really messed things up
what are you talking about
because maybe pat was talking to
someone just inside the building that night
and we know that someone
wasnt one of the teachers
come on
now youve put them
on the hunt for somebody
what difference does that make to you
big difference
because i was pats friend
she was telling me something
when you suddenly showed up
she got scared and she ran away
she was in hysterics almost
and then she was killed
remember that voice when you rang the bell
well that was me
i heard strange incredible absurd things
pat was taking notes on them for months
and before going away
she gave me all the notes
ive only told one person
a very good friend of mine
frank mandel hes here
for a convention
ill let you read them tonight
suzy wake up please wake up
the notes are gone someone
stole them from me
you understand they disappeared
dont fall asleep please help me
wake up help me
i cant
cant
this is the only thing i got left
and thats because i kept it on me look
look
what is it
whats the matter with you dont
you remember whats going on
this is the key thatll get us
wherever the teachers go every night
i thought it out yesterday evening
while i was sitting here next to you
suzy do you know
anything about witches
oh no please
dont leave me alone
i must get away
wait
wait
wait wait wait wait
looking for sara shes disappeared
but thats impossible i just
talked to her last night
she left this morning as a matter
of fact without telling anyone
just packed her bags and left she
was heard leaving about 600
you heard her leave didnt you
sara oh yes
i heard the door close and her
footsteps going down the hall
and then i heard a car driving off down the
street i guess someone was waiting for her
but its impossible
if she wasnt happy here she couldve told someone
why sneak off like a thief
hello may i speak to frank
mandel please yes thank you
hello this is suzy bannion
no weve never met im a
friend of saras
yes hello do you happen to
know where sara is
well she disappeared from
school this morning
yes it seems she left and
took all her luggage
yes uh listen could i see
you sometime today
well im really worried about her
oh great where
at the convention center
okay ill see you there
she didnt inform any of her classmates
ive already asked all of them
its very upsetting i cant
understand why she did it
im the one whos held responsible
by their families
ill call her father in geneva
perhaps she might have gone there
ive already phoned saras father
hes the italian consul in geneva
but he wasnt there today
he was away for the weekend
they said hed be back by monday and
they dont know anything about her there
well do you understand
why im so worried
yes but before we both get upset
lets wait for the fathers return
maybe they got together this morning
and went off on their own
i know her quite well she was a
patient of mine three years ago
were you aware of that
no i didnt even know you were a psychiatrist
well she had a nervous breakdown
after her mothers death
and she came to me for treatment
after she got better again
we remained friends
but lately she was upset about some notions
put into her head by a friend of hers
not you i hope
no
they were kind of wild ideas
she had discovered that the
tam academy was founded
in 1895 by a certain helena markos
a greek immigrant
and that the local people
believed her to be a witch
i guess you knew that
no but i have a strange feeling
that somebody already told me
about itor something similar
i cantcant remember
well that really got saras imagination
going earlier in the 19th century
the markos woman had been expelled
from several european countries
she seemed to have something about her
which urged religious people to persecute her
she also wrote a number of books and
i read that among the initiated
she went by the name the black queen
after she settled down here she became
the subject of a lot of gossip
nevertheless she managed to put
her hands on a great deal of money
and she founded the tam academy
at first a sort of school of
dance and occult sciences
but that didnt last long
because in 1905
after being hounded and
cursed at for ten years
madame markos died in a fire
thats all there is as far
as witchcraft is concerned
the school was taken over by her favorite
pupil the study of the occult was abandoned
and soon the place became
the famous dance academy
but what does it mean to be a witch
well as a believer in the material
world and a psychiatrist to boot
im convinced that the current spread
of belief in magic and the occult
is part of mental illness
bad luck isnt brought by broken
mirrors but by broken minds
excuse me milius
professor milius can answer your
question better than i can
he wrote a book called paranoia
or magic and believe me
its the final word on the subject
excuse me milius if you dont mind
id like you to meet a friend of mine
fraulein
shes interested in your favorite subject
witches
can you tell her something
about the mysterious
well i have to go i have an
appointment to keep
keep me posted hmm
hello im sorry to bother you
ah so what would you like to know
do you believe in the existence of witches
ah
i have known some women who
are said to be witches
really
i have studied the phenomenon for a long time
i am of the opinion that
it is an important appendage
of contemporary psychiatry
youre skeptical my dear
well frankly it is a little
hard to believe
what do witches do
they are malefic negative and destructive
their knowledge of the art of the occult
gives them tremendous powers
they can change the course of events and
peoples lives but only to do harm
you dont believe me
no i
their goal is to accumulate
great personal wealth
but that can only be achieved
by injury to others
they can cause suffering
sickness and even the death
of those who for whatever
reason have offended them
why do you have all this
interest in the occult
because some friends spoke
to me about witches
i read some stuff
have you ever heard of helena markos
oh yes she was a very
famous black queen
a powerful witch with a tremendous
talent for doing evil
a real mistress of magic
she lived and died in the city
did you know that
yes and might there exist
a guild of witches
the correct term would
be a coven of witches
a woman becomes queen of her magic
is a hundred times more powerful
than the rest of the coven
which is like a serpent
its strength rests with its leader
that is with its head
a coven deprived of its leader
is like a headless cobra
harmless
skepticism is the natural
reaction of people nowadays
but magic is ever present
in other words
which means that magic is everywhere
and all over the world
its a recognized fact
always
mark mark
excuse me where is everybody
they have all gone to the theater
for the opening of the bolshoi
then why didnt anyone tell me about it
i dont know
miss tanner obtained
tickets for everyone
frank this is suzy saras friend

footsteps stop here
