have you seen mummy 
well  she ll be in the drawing room  i expect 
i hope you re not gonna be getting under
our feet today  miss briony 
we got a dinner for 10 to prepare 
 hello  pal  i hear you re putting on a play 
 who told you 
jungle drums 
 will you come and see it 
 i m not sure that would be quite   
why don t you let me read it 
you used to make me those beautiful
bound copies of all your stories 
 i ve kept them all 
 i still want you to come 
 let s see 
 i have to go now 
mummy  i need you 
stupendous  it s stupendous  darling 
your first play 
do you think so 
do you think leon will like it 
well  of course he will 
the trials of arabella  by briony tallis 
 briony  cee 
 yes 
what do you think it would feel like
to be someone else 
cecilia  cooler  i should hope 
 i m worried about the play 
 i m sure it s a masterpiece 
but we only have the afternoon to rehearse 
what if the twins can t act 
you have to be nice to them 
i wonder how d you feel if your mother
had run off with mr what s his name
who reads the news on the wireless 
perhaps i should have written leon a story 
if you write a story  you only have to
say the word  castle   and you could see
the towers and the woods
and the village below  but   
in a play  it s   
it all depends on other people 
 cee 
 yes 
why don t you talk to robbie any more 
i do 
we just move in different circles  that s all 
 do we have to do a play 
 why do we have to 
 it s to celebrate my brother leon s visit 
 pierrot  i hate plays 
 jackson  so do l 
 how can you hate plays 
 it s just showing off 
 you ll be in this play or you ll get a clout 
 and i ll tell the parents 
 jackson  you re not allowed to clout us 
we re guests in this house  and what did
the parents say we were to make ourselves 
 well  pierrot 
 amenable 
 jackson 
 amenable 
amenable  that s right 
now  briony  what s your play about 
well  it s about how
love is all very well 
but you have to be sensible 
 i suppose you re going to be arabella 
 well  not necessarily 
 in that case  do you mind if i play her 
 pierrot  lola was in the school play 
do say yes  it d be the first decent thing
to happen to me in months 
well  yes  all right 
i suppose we should start by reading it 
if you re going to be arabella  then i ll be
the director  thank you very much 
sorry 
i m going to do the prologue 
 prologue 
 this is the tale of spontaneous arabella 
 who ran away with an extrinsic fellow 
 it grieved her parents to see their firstborn
 evanesce from her home
to go to eastbourne  
yes 
 nothing  just thought i d watch 
 briony  rehearsals are private  i m afraid 
you can see the play this evening 
 i ll have to work then 
 well  i m sorry  danny 
jackson  can we go for a swim now 
pierrot  yes  yes  yes 
 no  i don t really think there s time 
 pierrot  cecilia will let us 
i m sure a half hour break
would do us all good 
pierrot  cecilia  cecilia 
cecilia 
cecilia  cecilia  cecilia 
please  can we go for a swim  cecilia 
yes  i don t see why not 
don t go out of your depth 
can you do me
one of your bolshevik roll ups 
 cecilia  beautiful day 
 i suppose so  too hot for me 
 are you enjoying your book 
 no  not really 
it gets better 
i prefer fielding any day 
much more passionate 
 leon s coming down today  did you know 
 i heard a rumour 
he s bringing a friend with him 
it s paul marshall  the chocolate millionaire 
 are the flowers for him 
 why shouldn t they be 
leon says he s very charming 
the old man telephoned last night 
he says you re planning on being a doctor 
 i m thinking about it  yes 
 another six years of student life 
 how else do you become a doctor 
 you could get a fellowship  now 
 couldn t you  with your first 
 i don t want to teach 
i said i d pay your father back 
that s not what i meant at all 
 let me help with that 
 no  i m all right  thanks 
 take the flowers  take the flowers 
 i m all right  i m all right 
oh  you idiot 
do you realise that s probably
the most valuable thing we own 
not any more  it isn t 
careful 
i m   
leon  hello  robbie 
no need to encourage him 
cee 
mother 
 where is everyone  danny 
 i don t know  sir 
danny  sir 
leon  gasping for a drink 
 will you have one 
 paul  rather 
 whisky 
 please 
 leon 
 here she is 
cecilia  oh  i ve missed you 
i ve been going completely doolally up here 
 this is my sister  cecilia  paul marshall 
 i ve heard an awful lot about you 
 likewise 
 leon  where are we putting him 
in the blue room  mother s lying down 
she s got one of her migraines 
i m not surprised  with this heat 
it s the big room next to the nursery 
is the old man staying in town 
leon  looks like it 
some sort of rush on at the ministry 
pierrot  so aren t we doing the play 
lola  no 
 jackson  why not 
 don t ask me 
pierrot  i don t like it here 
paul  there s always a problem
when a new brand comes about 
the remarketing  the re packaging 
the re shaping 
even the re flavouring in some cases 
or whole new technology 
i think our main challenge is whether or not
to launch the new amo bar 
the army amo  do you see  pass the amo 
my source at the ministry is very reliable 
i used to clean his shoes at harrow 
informs me we have a good chance
of including it
in the standard issue ration pack 
which means that i d have to open
at least three more factories 
more if they bring in conscription 
which i say is bound to happen
if herr hitler doesn t pipe down 
he s about as likely to do that as buy shares
in marks and spencer s 
wouldn t you agree 
 this isn t very good 
 i make a cocktail with crushed ice 
rum and melted dark chocolate 
it s absolutely scrumptious 
 leon  guess who we met on the way in 
 robbie 
 i told him to join us tonight 
 oh  leon  you didn t 
so  robbie  the housekeeper s son 
whose father did a bunk 20 years ago 
gets a scholarship to the local grammar 
the old man puts him through cambridge 
goes up at the same time as cee  and
for three years she hardly speaks to him 
wouldn t let him within a mile
of her roedean chums 
anyone got a cigarette 
i don t know what the hell he s doing
these days  messing about in flower beds 
as a matter of fact  he s planning on doing
a medical degree 
leon  and the old man said yes to that 
look  i really think you should go down
to the lodge and ask him not to come 
why  has something happened
between you 
for god s sake 
 when can we go home 
 lola  soon 
we can t go home  it s a divorce 
 how dare you say that 
 well  it s true 
lola  you will never  ever use that word
again  do you understand 
 now what are we going to do 
 i m always asking myself that 
my name is paul marshall 
you must be the cousins from the north 
 what are your names 
 pierrot 
 jackson 
 what marvellous names 
jackson  do you know our parents 
paul  well  i ve read
about them in the paper 
 what exactly have you read about them 
 oh  you know  the usual sort of nonsense 
i ll thank you not to talk about this
in front of the children 
your parents
are absolutely wonderful people 
that s quite clear  and they love you
and think about you all the time 
jolly nice slacks 
we went to see a show
and i got them at liberty s 
 what was the show 
 hamlet 
ah  yes   to be or not to be  
i like your shoes 
duckers in the turl  they make
a wooden thing  shaped like your foot 
keep it forever 
pierrot  i m starving  when s dinner 
well  i might be able to help you there 
if you can guess what i do for a living 
 you ve got a chocolate factory 
 everyone knows that 
then it wasn t a guess  was it 
there ll be one of these in every kit bag
of every soldier in the british army 
sugar casing  so it won t melt 
jackson  why should they get free sweets 
 cause they ll be fighting for their country 
our daddy says
there isn t going to be a war 
your daddy is wrong 
 calling it the army amo 
 amo  amas  amat 
top marks 
it s boring how everything ends in  o  
 polo  and  aero  
 and  oxo  and  brillo  
 sounds as if you don t want it 
then i shall just have to give it
to your sister 
paul  bite it 
you have to bite it 
briony  the princess was well aware
of his remorseless wickedness 
but that made it no easier to overcome
the voluminous love she felt
in her heart for sir romulus 
the princess knew instinctively
that the one with red hair
was not to be trusted 
as his young ward dived again
and again to the depths of the lake 
in search of the enchanted chalice 
sir romulus twirled his luxuriant moustache 
sir romulus rode with his two companions 
northwards  drawing ever closer
to an effulgent sea 
so heroic in manner 
he appeared so valiant in word
no one could ever guess at the darkness
lurking in the black heart
of sir romulus turnbull 
he was the most dangerous man
in the world 
 dear cecilia  i thought i should write
to apologise for my clumsy
 and inconsiderate behaviour  
 forgive me if i seem strange but i m    
robbie  dear cecilia  you d be forgiven
for thinking me mad 
the way i acted this afternoon 
the truth is i feel rather lightheaded
and foolish in your presence  cee 
and i don t think i can blame the heat 
 will you forgive me 
 robbie  
off out then 
robbie  yes  leon s asked me
to join them for dinner 
so that s why i ve been polishing
silver all afternoon 
i ll think of you when i see my face
in the spoon 
you re not a bit like your father 
not in any way 
that s because i m all yours  i ll be late 
your shirts are hanging upstairs 
 son 
 yes 
nothing 
briony  is that you 
are you all right 
do you think you could do me a favour 
could you run ahead
and give this to cee  i   
 feel a bit of a fool handing it over myself 
 all right 
briony 
briony 
 i suppose he s what you might call eligible 
 rather 
he certainly seems to think
he s the cat s pyjamas 
which is odd  considering he has pubic hair
growing out of his ears 
i should imagine he d give you
a lot of very noisy  boneheaded sons 
 he s quite a good egg  actually 
 you say that about everyone 
 leon 
 rummy  if it ain t my little sis 
i wrote you a play  leon 
i wanted to do a play for you 
 the trials of arabella 
 well  there s still time 
 doesn t have to be this evening 
 no  it s impossible 
cecilia  briony 
leon  tell you what  i m good at voices 
you re even better 
so we ll read it out after dinner 
 briony  did you read this letter 
 yes  let s  that s a wonderful idea 
 briony 
 here we are  my choc tail 
i insist you try it 
wasn t there an envelope 
do you mind if i come in 
lola  i ve had the most appalling evening 
the twins have been torturing me  look 
how awful 
chinese burns 
that s right 
they want to go home 
they think it s me that s keeping them here 
lola 
can i tell you something 
something really terrible 
yes  please 
what s the worst word
you can possibly imagine 
 he s a sex maniac 
 that s right 
 what s cecilia going to do 
 i don t know 
 you ought to call the police 
 do you think so 
he said he thought about it all day long 
all you have to do is show them the letter 
 you won t tell anyone  will you  promise 
 i promise 
good  if he found out 
there s no knowing what he might do 
you re right 
you better tidy your face 
i ve still got to change 
thanks  briony  you re a real brick 
briony  cecilia 
 it was a mistake 
 briony read it 
my god  i m so sorry 
it was the wrong version 
yes 
 it was never meant to be read 
 no 
what was in the version
i was meant to read 
i don t know  it was more formal  less   
 anatomical 
 yes 
it s been there for weeks 
and then this morning by the fountain   
i ve never done anything like that before 
and i was so angry with you 
and with myself 
i thought if you went away to medical
school  then i d be happy  but   
i don t know how i could have been
so ignorant about myself  so   
so stupid 
you do know what i m talking about 
don t you 
you knew before i did 
why are you crying 
don t you know 
yes  i know exactly 
robbie 
cecilia 
i love you 
i love you 
someone s come in 
cecilia 
leon  people were sitting out
having dinner on the pavement 
it was always the view of my parents
that hot weather encouraged loose morals 
in high summer  my sister and l
were never allowed out of the house 
they thought the villagers would be
unnecessarily provoked 
what do you say  cee  does the hot weather
make you behave badly 
 good heavens  you re blushing 
 it s just hot in here  that s all 
lola  wipe that lipstick off 
you re far too young 
what about you  briony 
what sins have you committed today 
 i ve done nothing wrong 
 emily  have you seen the twins recently 
they didn t look very happy
last time i saw them  poor little chaps 
 briony  you know nothing about it 
 briony  i can t imagine what s got into you 
 i ve never known you to be so rude 
 briony  well  they re not poor little chaps 
 just look what they did to lola 
 what are you talking about 
briony  jackson and pierrot
bruised her arm  gave her chinese burns 
i m afraid she s quite right 
i had to pull them off her 
how i got my war wound 
the twins did that  lola 
paul  yes  it all turned
into a bit of a wrestle 
i m afraid  still  no harm done  eh  lola 
emily  would you go and find these boys 
please  briony 
tell them dinner s ready 
and where are their manners 
 why do i have to go 
 briony  you ll do as you re told 
or you ll go straight to your room 
 briony  it s a letter 
 give it to me 
briony  they ve run away 
emily  who has 
briony  the twins

and you don t even know
what happened before dinner 
i caught him attacking my sister
in the library 
i don t know what he d have done
if i hadn t come in 
 you actually saw him 
 of course i did  plain as day 
he pushed me to the ground 
and then he put his hands over my eyes 
 i couldn t actually    i never actually   
 listen  i ve known him
my whole life  and i saw him 
because i couldn t say for sure 
well  i can  and i will 
leon  call the police 
and she ll be needing a doctor  as well 
 it s all right  dear  it s all right now 
 cecilia  is robbie back yet

emily  well done  darling 
my brother and i found the two of them
down by the lake 
policeman  you didn t see anyone else 
i wouldn t necessarily believe everything
briony tells you  she s rather fanciful 
when they went looking 
i went up to my dad s 
 i did  honest 
 policeman  why was that 
to tell him all about it 
 i know i shouldn t have opened it 
 emily  no  you should not

 but

emily  cecilia

but   
i ll be late  better get moving 
excuse me 
he sleeps so deeply 
 what is she doing here 
 she wanted to speak to me 
oh  yes  what about 
the terrible thing i did 
robbie  darling 
i ll be quite honest with you 
i m torn between breaking your neck here
and taking you
and throwing you down the stairs 
oh  god 
do you have any idea what it s like in jail 
of course  you don t 
tell me  did it give you pleasure
to think of me inside 
 no 
 but you did nothing about it 
 no 
 do you think i assaulted your cousin 
 no 
 did you think it then 
yes  but yes and no 
 and what s made you so certain now 
 growing up 
 growing up 
 i was 13 
how old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong 
what are you  18 
do you have to be 18 before
you can bring yourself to own up to a lie 
there are soldiers of 18  old enough
to be left to die by the side of the road 
 did you know that 
 yes 
five years ago 
you didn t care about telling the truth 
you  all your family  you just assumed
that for all my education 
i was still little better than a servant 
still not to be trusted 
thanks to you  they were able to close ranks
and throw me to the fucking wolves 
 robbie  look at me  look at me 
 don t 
come back  come back 
come back to me 
cecilia  briony 
there isn t much time 
robbie has to report for duty at 6 00 
and he s got a train to catch 
so sit down 
there are some things
you re going to do for us 
you ll go to your parents
as soon as you can 
and you ll tell them everything
they need to know
to be convinced
that the evidence you gave was false 
you ll meet with a solicitor 
make a statement 
have it signed  witnessed 
send copies to us  is that clear 
yes 
you ll write a detailed letter to me
explaining everything that happened
leading up to you saying
you saw me by the lake 
try to include whatever you can remember
of what danny hardman was doing
that night 
 hardman 
 yes 
it wasn t danny hardman 
it was leon s friend  marshall 
i don t believe you 
he s married lola 
i ve just come from their wedding 
lola won t be able to testify
against him now 
he s immune 
i m very  very sorry for the terrible distress
that i have caused 
i am very  very sorry 
robbie  just do as we ve asked of you 
write it all down  just the truth  no rhymes 
no embellishments  no adjectives 
and then leave us be 
i will  i promise 
briony  i m sorry 
could we stop for a moment 
man  of course  is something the matter 
i just need a couple of minutes by myself 
   minutes by myself 
man  briony tallis  your new novel 
your twenty first  is called atonement  it s   
briony 
i m sorry  could we stop for a moment 
briony tallis  i d like to talk now
about your new novel  atonement 
which comes out in a few days
to coincide with your birthday 
 it s your twenty first novel   
 it s my last novel 
oh  really  are you retiring 
i m dying 
my doctor tells me
i have something called vascular dementia 
which is essentially
a continuous series of tiny strokes 
your brain closes down  gradually
you lose words  you lose your memory 
which for a writer is pretty much the point 
so that s why i could finally write the book 
i think  i had to 
and why  of course  it s my last novel 
strangely enough 
it would be just as accurate
to call it my first novel 
i wrote several drafts as far back as my time
at st thomas  hospital during the war 
i just couldn t ever find the way to do it 
man  because the novel is autobiographical 
is that right 
yes  entirely  i haven t changed any names 
including my own 
and was that the problem 
no 
i had  for a very long time 
decided to tell the absolute truth 
no rhymes  no embellishments 
and i think   
you ve read the book 
you ll understand why 
i got first hand accounts of all the events
i didn t personally witness 
the conditions in prison 
the evacuation to dunkirk  everything 
but the effect of all this honesty
was rather pitiless 
you see  i couldn t any longer imagine
what purpose would be served by it 
by what  sorry  served by honesty 
by honesty 
or reality 
because  in fact 
i was too much of a coward
to go and see my sister in june  1940 
i never made that journey to balham 
robbie  do you have any idea
what it s like in jail 
briony  so the scene in which
i confess to them is imagined 
cecilia  he sleeps so deeply 
briony  invented 
robbie  how old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong 
briony  and  in fact 
could never have happened 
because
robbie turner died of septicaemia
at bray dunes
on june the first  1940 
the last day of the evacuation 
cheerio  pal 
and i was never able to put things right
with my sister  cecilia 
because she was killed
on the 15th of october  1940 
by the bomb that destroyed the gas
and water mains above balham tube station 
so   
my sister and robbie were never able
to have the time together
they both so longed for  and deserved 
and which  ever since  i ve   
ever since i ve always felt i prevented 
but what sense of hope 
or satisfaction  could a reader derive
from an ending like that 
so  in the book  i wanted to give robbie
