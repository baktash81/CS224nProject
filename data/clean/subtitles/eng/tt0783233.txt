have you seen mummy
well shell be in the drawing room i expect
i hope youre not gonna be getting under
our feet today miss briony
we got a dinner for 10 to prepare
hello pal i hear youre putting on a play
who told you
jungle drums
will you come and see it
im not sure that would be quite
why dont you let me read it
you used to make me those beautiful
bound copies of all your stories
ive kept them all
i still want you to come
lets see
i have to go now
mummy i need you
stupendous its stupendous darling
your first play
do you think so
do you think leon will like it
well of course he will
the trials of arabella by briony tallis
briony cee
yes
what do you think it would feel like
to be someone else
cecilia cooler i should hope
im worried about the play
im sure its a masterpiece
but we only have the afternoon to rehearse
what if the twins cant act
you have to be nice to them
i wonder howd you feel if your mother
had run off with mr whatshisname
who reads the news on the wireless
perhaps i should have written leon a story
if you write a story you only have to
say the word castle and you could see
the towers and the woods
and the village below but
in a play its
it all depends on other people
cee
yes
why dont you talk to robbie any more
i do
we just move in different circles thats all
do we have to do a play
why do we have to
its to celebrate my brother leons visit
pierrot i hate plays
jackson so do l
how can you hate plays
its just showing off
youll be in this play or youll get a clout
and ill tell the parents
jackson youre not allowed to clout us
were guests in this house and what did
the parents say we were to make ourselves
well pierrot
amenable
jackson
amenable
amenable thats right
now briony whats your play about
well its about how
love is all very well
but you have to be sensible
i suppose youre going to be arabella
well not necessarily
in that case do you mind if i play her
pierrot lola was in the school play
do say yes itd be the first decent thing
to happen to me in months
well yes all right
i suppose we should start by reading it
if youre going to be arabella then ill be
the director thank you very much
sorry
im going to do the prologue
prologue
this is the tale of spontaneous arabella
who ran away with an extrinsic fellow
it grieved her parents to see their firstborn
evanesce from her home
to go to eastbourne
yes
nothing just thought id watch
briony rehearsals are private im afraid
you can see the play this evening
ill have to work then
well im sorry danny
jackson can we go for a swim now
pierrot yes yes yes
no i dont really think theres time
pierrot cecilia will let us
im sure a halfhour break
would do us all good
pierrot cecilia cecilia
cecilia
cecilia cecilia cecilia
please can we go for a swim cecilia
yes i dont see why not
dont go out of your depth
can you do me
one of your bolshevik rollups
cecilia beautiful day
i suppose so too hot for me
are you enjoying your book
no not really
it gets better
i prefer fielding any day
much more passionate
leons coming down today did you know
i heard a rumour
hes bringing a friend with him
its paul marshall the chocolate millionaire
are the flowers for him
why shouldnt they be
leon says hes very charming
the old man telephoned last night
he says youre planning on being a doctor
im thinking about it yes
another six years of student life
how else do you become a doctor
you could get a fellowship now
couldnt you with your first
i dont want to teach
i said id pay your father back
thats not what i meant at all
let me help with that
no im all right thanks
take the flowers take the flowers
im all right im all right
oh you idiot
do you realise thats probably
the most valuable thing we own
not any more it isnt
careful
im
leon hello robbie
no need to encourage him
cee
mother
where is everyone danny
i dont know sir
danny sir
leon gasping for a drink
will you have one
paul rather
whisky
please
leon
here she is
cecilia oh ive missed you
ive been going completely doolally up here
this is my sister cecilia paul marshall
ive heard an awful lot about you
likewise
leon where are we putting him
in the blue room mothers lying down
shes got one of her migraines
im not surprised with this heat
its the big room next to the nursery
is the old man staying in town
leon looks like it
some sort of rush on at the ministry
pierrot so arent we doing the play
lola no
jackson why not
dont ask me
pierrot i dont like it here
paul theres always a problem
when a new brand comes about
the remarketing the repackaging
the reshaping
even the reflavouring in some cases
or whole new technology
i think our main challenge is whether or not
to launch the new amo bar
the army amo do you see pass the amo
my source at the ministry is very reliable
i used to clean his shoes at harrow
informs me we have a good chance
of including it
in the standard issue ration pack
which means that id have to open
at least three more factories
more if they bring in conscription
which i say is bound to happen
if herr hitler doesnt pipe down
hes about as likely to do that as buy shares
in marks and spencers
wouldnt you agree
this isnt very good
i make a cocktail with crushed ice
rum and melted dark chocolate
its absolutely scrumptious
leon guess who we met on the way in
robbie
i told him to join us tonight
oh leon you didnt
so robbie the housekeepers son
whose father did a bunk 20 years ago
gets a scholarship to the local grammar
the old man puts him through cambridge
goes up at the same time as cee and
for three years she hardly speaks to him
wouldnt let him within a mile
of her roedean chums
anyone got a cigarette
i dont know what the hell hes doing
these days messing about in flower beds
as a matter of fact hes planning on doing
a medical degree
leon and the old man said yes to that
look i really think you should go down
to the lodge and ask him not to come
why has something happened
between you
for gods sake
when can we go home
lola soon
we cant go home its a divorce
how dare you say that
well its true
lola you will never ever use that word
again do you understand
now what are we going to do
im always asking myself that
my name is paul marshall
you must be the cousins from the north
what are your names
pierrot
jackson
what marvellous names
jackson do you know our parents
paul well ive read
about them in the paper
what exactly have you read about them
oh you know the usual sort of nonsense
ill thank you not to talk about this
in front of the children
your parents
are absolutely wonderful people
thats quite clear and they love you
and think about you all the time
jolly nice slacks
we went to see a show
and i got them at libertys
what was the show
hamlet
ah yes to be or not to be
i like your shoes
duckers in the turl they make
a wooden thing shaped like your foot
keep it forever
pierrot im starving whens dinner
well i might be able to help you there
if you can guess what i do for a living
youve got a chocolate factory
everyone knows that
then it wasnt a guess was it
therell be one of these in every kit bag
of every soldier in the british army
sugar casing so it wont melt
jackson why should they get free sweets
cause theyll be fighting for their country
our daddy says
there isnt going to be a war
your daddy is wrong
calling it the army amo
amo amas amat
top marks
its boring how everything ends in o
polo and aero
and oxo and brillo
sounds as if you dont want it
then i shall just have to give it
to your sister
paul bite it
you have to bite it
briony the princess was well aware
of his remorseless wickedness
but that made it no easier to overcome
the voluminous love she felt
in her heart for sir romulus
the princess knew instinctively
that the one with red hair
was not to be trusted
as his young ward dived again
and again to the depths of the lake
in search of the enchanted chalice
sir romulus twirled his luxuriant moustache
sir romulus rode with his two companions
northwards drawing ever closer
to an effulgent sea
so heroic in manner
he appeared so valiant in word
no one could ever guess at the darkness
lurking in the black heart
of sir romulus turnbull
he was the most dangerous man
in the world
dear cecilia i thought i should write
to apologise for my clumsy
and inconsiderate behaviour
forgive me if i seem strange but im
robbie dear cecilia youd be forgiven
for thinking me mad
the way i acted this afternoon
the truth is i feel rather lightheaded
and foolish in your presence cee
and i dont think i can blame the heat
will you forgive me
robbie
off out then
robbie yes leons asked me
to join them for dinner
so thats why ive been polishing
silver all afternoon
ill think of you when i see my face
in the spoon
youre not a bit like your father
not in any way
thats because im all yours ill be late
your shirts are hanging upstairs
son
yes
nothing
briony is that you
are you all right
do you think you could do me a favour
could you run ahead
and give this to cee i
feel a bit of a fool handing it over myself
all right
briony
briony
i suppose hes what you might call eligible
rather
he certainly seems to think
hes the cats pyjamas
which is odd considering he has pubic hair
growing out of his ears
i should imagine hed give you
a lot of very noisy boneheaded sons
hes quite a good egg actually
you say that about everyone
leon
rummy if it aint my little sis
i wrote you a play leon
i wanted to do a play for you
the trials of arabella
well theres still time
doesnt have to be this evening

cecilia briony
leon tell you what im good at voices

briony

lola ive had the most appalling evening
the twins have been torturing me look
how awful

they want to go home
they think its me thats keeping them here
lola
can i tell you something
something really terrible
yes please
whats the worst word
you can possibly imagine
hes a sex maniac
thats right
whats cecilia going to do
i dont know
you ought to call the police
do you think so
he said he thought about it all day long
all you have to do is show them the letter
you wont tell anyone will you promise
i promise
good if he found out
theres no knowing what he might do
youre right
you better tidy your face
ive still got to change
thanks briony youre a real brick
briony cecilia
it was a mistake
briony read it
my god im so sorry
it was the wrong version
yes
it was never meant to be read
no
what was in the version
i was meant to read
i dont know it was more formal less
anatomical
yes
its been there for weeks
and then this morning by the fountain
ive never done anything like that before
and i was so angry with you
and with myself
i thought if you went away to medical
school then id be happy but
i dont know how i could have been
so ignorant about myself so
so stupid

why are you crying
dont you know
yes i know exactly
robbie
cecilia
i love you
i love you
someones come in
cecilia
leon people were sitting out
having dinner on the pavement
it was always the view of my parents
that hot weather encouraged loose morals
in high summer my sister and l
were never allowed out of the house
they thought the villagers would be
unnecessarily provoked
what do you say cee does the hot weather
make you behave badly
good heavens youre blushing
its just hot in here thats all
lola wipe that lipstick off
youre far too young
what about you briony
what sins have you committed today
ive done nothing wrong

into a bit of a wrestle
im afraid still no harm done eh lola
emily would you go and find these boys

bombed and just disappear

i am only now beginning to grasp

ill be late better get moving
excuse me
he sleeps so deeply
what is she doing here
she wanted to speak to me
oh yes what about
the terrible thing i did
robbie darling
ill be quite honest with you
im torn between breaking your neck here
and taking you
and throwing you down the stairs
oh god
do you have any idea what its like in jail
of course you dont
tell me did it give you pleasure
to think of me inside
no
but you did nothing about it
no
do you think i assaulted your cousin
no
did you think it then
yes but yes and no
and whats made you so certain now
growing up
growing up
i was 13
how old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong
what are you 18
do you have to be 18 before
you can bring yourself to own up to a lie
there are soldiers of 18 old enough
to be left to die by the side of the road
did you know that
yes
five years ago
you didnt care about telling the truth
you all your family you just assumed
that for all my education
i was still little better than a servant
still not to be trusted
thanks to you they were able to close ranks
and throw me to the fucking wolves
robbie look at me look at me
dont
come back come back
come back to me
cecilia briony
there isnt much time
robbie has to report for duty at 600
and hes got a train to catch
so sit down
there are some things
youre going to do for us
youll go to your parents
as soon as you can
and youll tell them everything
they need to know
to be convinced
that the evidence you gave was false
youll meet with a solicitor
make a statement
have it signed witnessed
send copies to us is that clear
yes
youll write a detailed letter to me
explaining everything that happened
leading up to you saying
you saw me by the lake
try to include whatever you can remember
of what danny hardman was doing
that night
hardman
yes
it wasnt danny hardman
it was leons friend marshall
i dont believe you
hes married lola
ive just come from their wedding
lola wont be able to testify
against him now
hes immune
im very very sorry for the terrible distress
that i have caused
i am very very sorry
robbie just do as weve asked of you
write it all down just the truth no rhymes
no embellishments no adjectives
and then leave us be
i will i promise
briony im sorry
could we stop for a moment
man of course is something the matter
i just need a couple of minutes by myself
minutes by myself
man briony tallis your new novel
your twentyfirst is called atonement its
briony
im sorry could we stop for a moment
briony tallis id like to talk now
about your new novel atonement
which comes out in a few days
to coincide with your birthday
its your twentyfirst novel
its my last novel
oh really are you retiring
im dying
my doctor tells me
i have something called vascular dementia
which is essentially
a continuous series of tiny strokes
your brain closes down gradually
you lose words you lose your memory
which for a writer is pretty much the point
so thats why i could finally write the book
i think i had to
and why of course its my last novel
strangely enough
it would be just as accurate
to call it my first novel
i wrote several drafts as far back as my time
at st thomas hospital during the war
i just couldnt ever find the way to do it
man because the novel is autobiographical
is that right
yes entirely i havent changed any names
including my own
and was that the problem
no
i had for a very long time
decided to tell the absolute truth
no rhymes no embellishments
and i think
youve read the book
youll understand why
i got firsthand accounts of all the events
i didnt personally witness
the conditions in prison
the evacuation to dunkirk everything
but the effect of all this honesty
was rather pitiless
you see i couldnt any longer imagine
what purpose would be served by it
by what sorry served by honesty
by honesty
or reality
because in fact
i was too much of a coward
to go and see my sister in june 1940
i never made that journey to balham
robbie do you have any idea
what its like in jail
briony so the scene in which
i confess to them is imagined
cecilia he sleeps so deeply
briony invented
robbie how old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong
briony and in fact
could never have happened
because
robbie turner died of septicaemia
at braydunes
on june the first 1940
the last day of the evacuation
cheerio pal
and i was never able to put things right
with my sister cecilia
because she was killed
on the 15th of october 1940
by the bomb that destroyed the gas
and water mains above balham tube station
so
my sister and robbie were never able
to have the time together
they both so longed for and deserved
and which ever since ive
ever since ive always felt i prevented
but what sense of hope
or satisfaction could a reader derive
from an ending like that
so in the book i wanted to give robbie
