june june

as federal agents and theyll dip you
dip me in what
disinformation protocol
theyll tell you a story about me
about how im mentally unstable
paranoid
how im violent and dangerous
and itll all sound very convincing
im already convinced
theres a few common dip keywords
to listen for
reassuring words
words like stabilize secure safe
if they say these words
particularly with repetition
okay
it means theyre going to kill you
oh god

with an onthescene report
according to faa sources
at approximately 730 last night
all contact was lost with a
bostonbound commuter jet from wichita
the plane was apparently passing through
an area of turbulence

my point is
my point is
that plane crash made me think
about our breakup
you know this bulb went off bing
rodney why are you giving up
youre being passive
getting back at her
because she didnt want the ring
so june didnt want
to be engaged right now
and that freaks your mom out big deal

our list you know
like camping in vermont with my brother
and sheila in their new winnie
tickets to blue man group
the battlegrounds tour
i wanna talk about the plane crash okay

i was on it i mean in it
i mean i was in it
so you were in the plane crash
i wasnt supposed to be on that plane

and there was this guy who was some sort
of secret agent or something and he
he killed everybody on board
and then he landed the plane
next thing you know
i wake up im in my room
i have no idea how i got there
he mustve drugged me or something
then i go to aprils fitting

it might be the best thing
that ever happened to him

to stay off the plane last night
when
well when i said
sometimes things happen for a reason
thats not a warning
thats not a warning roy
thats like a needlepoint expression
or a bumper sticker
next time try june if you get
on this plane you will fucking die
you know roy maybe they meant it
when they said that i would be safe
you really mean that june
yeah
did you feel safe with them
safer than i do now
okay okay all right
just so you understand
right now out there on your own
your life expectancy is like here
with me its here without me here
with me without me
with me without me
so
i wouldnt advise going home
but you know its up to you
so right now i need another car
keep moving
someone else is depending on me
someone whose life is in danger
someone who trusts me
every second i waste chasing you
im letting him down
rodney why did you make this brave call
to leap into action
well i didnt think
i just did what any man would do
in that situation you know
i leapt into action
thanks
like you said its really the job
you should be so proud
thanks
good job
it really didnt even hurt
it was kind of like a bee sting
what a brave firefighter
the doctors tell me rodney is going
to be okay just a flesh wound
a true blue boston hero back to you don
this is what its all about
that right there
is what everybody wants
a burger king toy
open it up
its warm what is it
a battery
a battery
its codenamed zephyr
not your average duracell
its high output never runs out
what do you mean never
that little thing there is the first
perpetual energy source since the sun

i will speak to you any way i please tony
we both know youre lucky im here
i have the battery im on a schedule
the world is full of bad guys

whats it worth to you
are you angry about your island roy
tick tick tick tick tick tony
im isabel george director
of counter espionage at the cia
im sure you are
forgive me i just
i just dont know exactly what to believe
well thats understandable
considering that the last five days
youve been fed a steady diet
of misinformation and fantasy
by an agent of ours
whos recently gone rogue
well he said that fitzgerald was the
one that wanted to steal the battery
well lets examine the facts
miller told you that he was protecting the
zephyr from people wanting to misuse it
but now hes trying to sell it
to an international arms dealer
antonio quintana
one of europes leading
weapons manufacturers
ask yourself miss havens
has roy miller said anything to you
thats proven to be true
god excuse me
no im sorry
sorry i was looking at my phone
i hate it when people do that
oh my god im so sorry
this is getting to be a habit
yeah it is
he used you as a mule to carry the battery
through security miss havens
hes been playing you
hes a spy thats what he does
he lies for a living
any love empathy
we train that right out of them
what did you imagine
the two of you would move
into a condo together get a dog
you cant have a life with him
thats fantasy
but you can have yours back
shes been gone eight minutes
we need you to get back to the hotel
before miller
what am i supposed to do
all right then
this pen is a transmitter
once you have confirmation
that miller has not hidden the zephyr
that its somewhere nearby
or on his person
you can confirm this
by simply clicking the top button
im sorry im late
everything go okay
well enough
its getting hotter
so did you get your price
i followed you tonight
you have nothing to say
heres to wichita
where we first
bumped into each other
