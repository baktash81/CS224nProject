my dad had a garage 
and when i was a kid 
he bought this chassis 
he used to take us to yards 
and search for parts  you know 
he died in  98

i just figured  why not finish it up 
give it to her sort of as a wedding present 
kind of like a present
from our dad  too  you know 
that s nice 
  yeah 
  yeah 
i used to think that
someday  when the last part went in 
i would just climb into that gto
and start it up 
just drive and drive and drive 
and just keep driving
until i got to the tip of south america 
  cape horn 
  yeah 
  there s beautiful islands down there 
  yeah 
pirate islands 
yeah   someday  
that s a dangerous word 
dangerous

you don t know me 
  june  june 
  okay 
you need to tell them
you don t remember anything 
and you need to avoid getting in
any vehicle with them at all costs 
okay  who are  them  
well  they re serious people  june 
they ll probably identify themselves
as federal agents  and they ll dip you 
dip me  in what 
dis information protocol 
they ll tell you a story about me 
about how i m mentally unstable 
paranoid 
how i m violent and dangerous 
and it ll all sound very convincing 
i m already convinced 
there s a few common dip keywords
to listen for 
reassuring words 
words like   stabilize    secure    safe  
if they say these words 
particularly with repetition   
okay 
   it means they re going to kill you 
oh  god

for a very long time 
  okay 
  okay 
now  stay with me 
if they tell you you re safe   
if they tell me i m safe 
they re gonna kill me

  i ll run 
  run 
  run 
and if they ask you about me   
i don t know you  i don t know you at all 
who are you  roy 
   a mixing of rain and snow 
good for ski country  but probably

with an on the scene report 
according to faa sources 
at approximately 7 30 last night 
all contact was lost with a
boston bound commuter jet from wichita 
the plane was apparently passing through
an area of turbulence
and may have met up with wind shear
or a lightning storm
causing an electrical failure 
now  this is all conjecture at this point 
as all that s left is a crater
in an indiana cornfield 
coming

my point is   
my point is 
that plane crash made me think
about our break up 
you know  this bulb went off  bing 
 rodney  why are you giving up 
you re being passive  
 getting back at her
because she didn t want the ring  
 so june didn t want
to be engaged right now 
 and that freaks your mom out  big deal 
 what about all the things you
and june wanted to do together  huh  
our list  you know 
like camping in vermont with my brother
and sheila in their new winnie 
tickets to blue man group 
the battlegrounds tour 
i wanna talk about the plane crash  okay 
sure  what about it 
i was on it  i mean  in it 
i mean  i was in it 
so you were in the plane crash 
i wasn t supposed to be on that plane 
but i was on it 
and there was this guy who was some sort
of secret agent or something  and he   
he killed everybody on board 
and then he landed the plane 
next thing you know 
i wake up  i m in my room 
i have no idea how i got there 
he must ve drugged me or something 
then i go to april s fitting 
because i have to wear
this ridiculous dress 
these other guys  these other agents
come  they snatch me up 
next thing you know 
i m in grand theft auto on the l 93 
  why are you touching my hand 
  because i m here for you 
  jeez  you are so stressed out 
  well  yeah 
  and i get it

we re running out of time 
and maybe i didn t make it clear enough 
but we re gonna have to stick together
for a little bit  because of our   
you know  our situation 
in case you didn t notice 
rodney is a fireman  okay 
so he s perfectly capable of handling
any situation that comes up 
thank you very much 
you can leave us alone 
i have no doubt 
ever since i was a little kid 
i have great respect for firemen 
  i appreciate it 
  fact of the matter is 
  i don t think you guys get paid enough 
  yeah  we don t 
you re in engine 10

your lieutenant s exam yet 
  i m working on it

it s the fastest way up the ladder 
  rodney

sorry  i thought you were making a move 
sorry  it s all right 
i thought he was making a move 
making a little pie 
pies for everybody  everybody 
everybody gets pies  okay 
no ice cream  à la mode 
weakens the legs  people  lincoln knew it 
it s why they got to him 
no one follows us 
or i kill myself and then her

this is gonna be better for you
than grove hall  it s all good 
okay  you good 
  good 
  good 
good 
there were four security cameras
in that restaurant  june 
now there is proof you re my hostage 
so we ve cleared your name 
with the locals  at least 
you know  it s a start 
something to build on 
  you shot rodney 
  yeah  i did 
but i asked him to stay in the booth 
you shot rodney 
it might be the best thing
that ever happened to him 
yeah  right  because we all should
get shot every now and then 
rodney    rodney is a good guy  june 
but not really right for you 
i mean  you know  in my opinion 
but a good guy 
took a bullet  he s gonna be a hero 
probably get a promotion 
  stop the car  stop the car 
  what 
stop the car  stop the car 
stop the car  just stop the car 
june  i understand
you want off the carousel 
i do  i wanna get off the carousel 
please  roy 
can you stop the car  please  right now 
i m not one of those
 i told you so  kind of guys 
but i did warn you
to stay off the plane last night 
when 
well  when i said 
 sometimes things happen for a reason  
that s not a warning 
that s not a warning  roy 
that s like a needlepoint expression
or a bumper sticker 
next time  try   june  if you get
on this plane  you will fucking die  
you know  roy  maybe they meant it
when they said that i would be safe 
  you really mean that  june 
  yeah 
  did you feel safe with them 
  safer than i do now 
okay  okay  all right 
just so you understand 
right now  out there  on your own 
your life expectancy is like here 
with me  it s here  without me  here 
with me  without me 
with me  without me 
so   
i wouldn t advise going home 
but  you know  it s up to you 
so right now i need another car 
keep moving 
someone else is depending on me 
someone whose life is in danger 
someone who trusts me 
every second i waste chasing you 
i m letting him down 
rodney  why did you make this brave call
to leap into action 
well  i didn t think 
i just did what any man would do
in that situation  you know 
  i leapt into action 
  thanks 
  like you said  it s really the job 
  you should be so proud 
  thanks 
  good job 
it really didn t even hurt 
it was kind of like a bee sting 
what a brave firefighter 
the doctors tell me rodney is going
to be okay  just a flesh wound 
a true blue boston hero  back to you  don 
this is what it s all about 
that  right there 
is what everybody wants 
a burger king toy 
open it up 
it s warm  what is it 
a battery 
a battery 
it s code named zephyr 
not your average duracell 
it s high output  never runs out 
what do you mean   never  
that little thing there is the first
perpetual energy source since the sun 
so  what  your flashlight
never runs out of juice 
it can power a lot more
than a flashlight  june 
really  how much more 
small city 
large submarine 
it s big 
the guy who invented it
is barely out of high school 
simon feck 
i was assigned with another agent to
watch him at a facility  a lab in wichita 
and the other guy  the agent  is the guy
who picked you up this morning 
fitzgerald 
a couple of weeks ago  i found out
he was going to sell the battery
and kill simon 
so i got simon out of there 
put him someplace safe
and went back for the battery 
and fitz set me up 
made it look like i went rogue 
that s when i met you 
so   
so  what s next  i mean  what s the plan

i will speak to you any way i please  tony 
we both know you re lucky i m here 
i have the battery  i m on a schedule 
the world is full of bad guys
and people are calling 
i understand 
what s your price 
i have a figure in mind 
what s it worth to you 
are you angry about your island  roy 
tick  tick  tick  tick  tick  tony 
i m isabel george  director
of counter espionage at the cia 
i m sure you are 
forgive me  i just   
i just don t know exactly what to believe 
well  that s understandable 
considering that the last five days
you ve been fed a steady diet
of misinformation and fantasy
by an agent of ours
who s recently gone rogue 
well  he said that fitzgerald was the
one that wanted to steal the battery 
well  let s examine the facts 
miller told you that he was protecting the
zephyr from people wanting to misuse it 
but now he s trying to sell it
to an international arms dealer 
antonio quintana 
one of europe s leading
weapons manufacturers 
ask yourself  miss havens 
has roy miller said anything to you
that s proven to be true 
  god  excuse me 
  no  i m sorry 
sorry  i was looking at my phone 
i hate it when people do that 
oh  my god  i m so sorry 
  this is getting to be a habit 
  yeah  it is 
he used you as a mule to carry the battery
through security  miss havens 
he s been playing you 
he s a spy  that s what he does 
he lies for a living 
any love  empathy 
we train that right out of them 
what did you imagine 
the two of you would move
into a condo together  get a dog 
you can t have a life with him 
that s fantasy 
but you can have yours back 
she s been gone eight minutes 
we need you to get back to the hotel
before miller 
  what am i supposed to do 
  all right  then 
this pen is a transmitter 
once you have confirmation
that miller has not hidden the zephyr 
that it s somewhere nearby 
or on his person 
you can confirm this
by simply clicking the top button 
i m sorry i m late 
everything go okay 
well enough 
it s getting hotter 
so  did you get your price 
i followed you tonight 
you have nothing to say 
here s to wichita
where we first   
bumped into each other 
do you think that was fate  roy 
i don t believe in fate 
but i believe in luck 
i don t know what to believe 
that hurt more than i thought it would 
i m going home 
they promised that if you turned
yourself in  they d protect you 
i love your optimism 
never lose it 
get her out of here 
he s not here  sir 
did they tell you you re going home

of the honeycomb  june

we lost him in kuwait 
there was a chopper crash 
he saved the lives
of two of his crewmen  and   
he just always took care of everyone 
he was an eagle scout
