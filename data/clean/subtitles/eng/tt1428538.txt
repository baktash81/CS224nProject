  wait 
  no 
i said  stay here 
father  wait 
help us  please 
hello  is anybody there 
eat 
eat 
eat 
eat 
this oven s not hot enough 
more wood 
what 
is it hot enough for you now 
my sister and i
never saw our parents again 
it was just the two of us 
but we learned a couple of things
while trapped in that house 
one  never walk into a house
made of candy 
and two  if you re gonna kill a witch 
set her ass on fire 
fresh milk  fresh milk
for the children 
keep your children healthy  fresh milk 
after weeks of living in fear 
we have finally caught the one
responsible for all this terror 
for crimes against
the city and people of augsburg 
for crimes against
the city and people of augsburg 
and for consorting with
the spawn of satan 
i hereby accuse this woman
of the craft of witchery 
burn her  burn her 
behold
the eyes of the demon 
go to hell 
order 
order 
berringer 
this is still my town 
listen to me 
as your mayor  i know only too well
that many of you
have lost precious loved ones to this
witch plague 
but we can t just burn this woman 
we first need evidence 
we can t just have   
you know a witch when you see one 
they ride at night
and they make pacts with the devil 
this woman will burn 
burn her  burn her 
let the girl go
or i m gonna blow your sheriff s brains
all over these fucking hillbillies 
move  go on 
let her go  go over there 
check her 
what s your name 
what s your name 
  mina 
  don t worry 
when a woman truly deals in witchcraft 
she cannot hide it 
a nasty rot sets in  it shows in her teeth 
in her skin and her eyes 
this is not a witch  this woman s clean 
i m sure your sheriff was only trying
to protect you good people 
but your mayor has done
a very smart thing 
he hired us 
my name is gretel 
and this is my brother  hansel 
we know that many of your children
have gone missing 
but killing an innocent woman
will not bring them back 
go home  we don t want you here 
we don t want more evil in augsburg 
well  evil is upon you 
whether you like it or not 
now if your children are still alive 
we will find them 
but if anyone harms this woman 
you re gonna have me to deal with 
now go home 
go 
i guess you re free to go 
thank you 
hansel 
you re welcome 
what the hell do you think
you re doing  huh 
that woman is a suspect in my custody 
you can t just come here   
any man with half a brain
could see that she was not a witch 
now listen  sheriff 
hansel and gretel
have been brought here   
you better listen 
i m not going to have this bitch
and her scoundrel of a brother
coming into my town 
telling me what to do 
don t 
just don t 
come on  let s get you started 
there s been reports of
a strange cottage in the north forest 
locals won t go near the place 
a good place to start the investigation 
move 
gretel 
she looks angry 
yeah 
a face like that  i d be angry  too 
would you shut up 
that witch we found
was a dead end  mayor 
no trace of any kids  i m sorry 
but we found this 
that is called the blood moon  mayor 
an eclipse of the moon 
it happens once in a generation
and is a night most holy to witches 
oh  my god 
when 
according to this 
three nights from now 
there s no doubt in my mind
that all this is connected 
children being taken in these numbers
from the roads and fields
so close to town 
a witch does not come out
in the open like that 
not unless she has to 
witch activity
has been increasing lately 
more sightings 
animal slaughter  sabbaths 
it seems the coming of the blood moon
is dragging every damned witch
from their dark hiding place 
so 
it seems like a good thing
that you brought us here 
doesn t it  mayor 
half your money now 
the rest when the children
are brought back alive 
oh  there he is  right on time 
this is jackson 
he knows these woods inside and out 
and he ll take you to where
the last sightings were 
yeah  we can be there in a few hours 
not at night  it s too dangerous 
not at night  it s too dangerous 
we ll leave in the morning 
yeah  she s right 
it s much too dangerous 
so  any place
we can get a drink in this hellhole 
shut up 
the last one they took was a boy 
less than two days ago 
so the scent is still fresh 
100 shilling for every child
you return alive 
you better be fast
before our mayor s witch hunters
rob this town blind 
you leave tonight 
in witch country at night 
you must be out of your mind 
i m telling you 
we should put the fire out 
we re hunting witches 
not bears  and we have to eat 
such beautiful creatures 
are they yours 
yes  ma am 
why have you come here 
to the dark of the forest 
a child was taken  ma am 
we re here to find him
and take him back 
there are no children here 
here   
there s only death 
witch 
fools 
this is my land 
how dare you 
please 
please  god    no 
there s no use in praying  my friend 
even your god knows better
than to come here 
there have been
abductions here and here 
on both sides of the river 
and on this last one 
we believe a troll was involved 
  a troll 
  trolls are extra 
another round 
it s really unusual  look at this one 
a father and three children attacked 
one child was taken 
but she didn t touch the other two 
that s weird 
that s so weird 
  it is strange  it is strange  okay 
  yeah  yeah 
then again 
we hunt witches for a living 
what s normal  really 
excuse me  hansel and gretel 
oh  my god  i can t believe you re here 
i m ben  benjamin walser 
i am really quite a fan of your work 
that s great 
it s nice to meet you  benjamin 
listen  if it s not too much trouble 
  would you please sign   
  oh  no   
okay 
oh  my 
yeah  that s from when you
found the fox witch of antwerp
and sank her in the moat 
and this one s from the
secret witch ring of belsen 
when they tried to put a gate to
hell under the courthouse 
i mean  you guys  you certainly
taught those witches a thing or two 
wow 
this is amazing  and weird 
  a little creepy 
  yeah   
you really keep all this stuff 
all right  well   
i just have so many questions 
do you mind 
  you know  we have   
  oh  no  no 
  you go ahead 
  all right 
okay  how do you best kill a witch 
hansel 
cutting off their heads tends to work 
ripping out their hearts 
and skinning them is also nice 
yeah  but burning is the best way 
 cause that s the only way to be safe 
  burning  yeah  of course 
  burn them all 
is it true that witches can t harm you 
well  no  that is horseshit  son 
their magic doesn t work on us 
and they haven t killed us  yet 
do you think that s because of
the witch that you burned
when you were children 
i guess that s how
it all started for you guys 
i mean  is that how
you became witch hunters 
how did you get your guns 
  how did you get your weapons 
  okay  okay 
there s lots of things to do 
you re a really nice kid 
but we have a town under attack 
she killed them 
she killed them all 
who killed what 
the witch 
she killed the trackers  all of them 
she gave me a message 
for you all 
the curse of hunger
for crawling things 
i fucking hate that one 
that was awesome 
it s working 
it s not even warm 
muriel  this could change everything 
it will change everything 
we will be invincible 
take it out 
take it out  take it out 
it s of no use if it doesn t last 
i can make it last 
forever 
where are we going 
we re almost there 
hey 
hey 
i just had this really weird dream 
  oh  yeah 
  yeah 
about what 
i think it was about our mother 
we don t talk about that 
go to sleep 
what do you think  boy  girl 
okay  here you go  i ll take this 
a little small for you  maybe 
oh  hello 
no  this  this is   
this is not for me 
so  how goes the witch hunting 
it s good  witch hunting s good 
it s strange being among these people 
yeah 
if you hadn t come 
they d have burned me alive 
yeah  well  i probably
would have let them 
but i m old fashioned that way 
my sister  however 
requires a little bit more evidence
before someone gets roasted 
have you ever come across a witch
that you didn t want to kill 
no  never 
the only good witch is a dead witch 
can you hold this 
are you all right 
yeah 
when i was a kid 
a witch made me eat
so much candy  i got sick 
something happened to me 
i have to take this injection
every few hours or else i die 
you have the sugar sickness 
i actually know a thing or two about it
if you ever need any help   
it s all right 
  so

shit 
  good morning 
  what are you doing 
you were covered in filth  so i was just
cleaning 
what happened 
well  the witches took a young girl 
well  the witches took a young girl 
and a lot of people died in the fires 
and now the sheriff 
he s blaming you and your brother
for what happened last night 
augsburg s not really
safe for you anymore 
and my brother 
last time i saw him 
he was fighting one of them
on her broom  flying out of town 
right 
wow 
where did you get all this stuff 
from everywhere 
i actually plan to be a witch hunter 
too  when i get older 
like you guys

not too hot  not too cold  but just right

we made a promise  you know that 
why do you think
the witches  spells don t work on us

  this is our house 
  yeah 
this is where we grew up 
and what does that look like to you 
i don t know  gretel 
we grew up over a witch s lair 
so what  so we re cursed 
no  i think that our mother was   
i see you finally found your way
home after all these years 
how very sweet 
i remember this house 
the house of adrianna 
the great white witch 
your whore of a mother 
let me tell you a little story 
once upon a time 
near a shitty little town 
there was a farmer who fell
in love with a white witch 
and with their two beautiful children 
oh  they were so happy 
but not for long 
during a blood moon  there is a potion
that will make you immune to fire 
the key to the potion
is the heart of a grand white witch 
but your mother 
the most powerful white witch 
was too strong for us 
so it had to be you  gretel 
it had to be your heart 
as the blood moon approached 
i sent out a little rumor
to the people of augsburg 
and when she knew they were coming 
she had your father take you
into the forest to hide you 
father  wait 
don t let her get away 
she didn t know what
they would do to her 
but she was too proud to run 
and a white witch would never use her
magic against humans 
when your father came back for her   
no 
   they hanged him 
  run him up 
  no 
   right in front
of your mother s burning flesh 
adrianna was gone 
but so was your heart 
and the blood moon passed 
the end 
it s a beautiful story  don t you think 
they died to save you 
and all your life 
how you ve hated them 
tomorrow
sisters from all dark corners of the land
will join me in the light
of the blood moon
for the greatest sabbath of all 
the only thing left
is the everlasting power
of the heart
of a grand white witch 
you know  you talk too much 
bad move  witch hunter 
hansel 
drink it  it will help the pain 
mina 
what did you do 
mina 
you re a witch 
there are good witches in the world 
  not many  but some 
  you stay back 
i m a witch  but i won t hurt you 
i checked you  you were   
you were clean 
yeah  but only the dark witches
bear the signs 
dark witches 
what are you talking about

why would mine 
i m not like them  hansel 
gretel  shit 
  where are you going 
  they have my sister 
who has your sister 
witches have my sister  they   
  where 
  they said something
about a ritual or a gathering 
i don t know

nearby the mountains 
a place dark witches use
for their sabbath 
where is it 
hansel  i   
mina  how do i get there 
if there is a sabbath 
there will be many witches 
they ll be too powerful 
they ll kill you  hansel 
i don t have time for this 
no  listen  hansel 
i found something here  in this cave 
something very powerful 
something that could help us 
the abramelin grimoire  it exists 
this is the book
of protection against black magic 
i can t believe this 
where did you find it 
don t ask  kid 
if this thing does what it says 
it will allow us
to penetrate their protection 
oh  yeah 
their wands won t
protect them anymore 
we just need something to bless 
okay  let s start with this 
i hope this works 
you ever shoot a gun 
well  i did win the county fair
three times
