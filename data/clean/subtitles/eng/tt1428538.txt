eat

this ovens not hot enough
more wood
what
is it hot enough for you now
my sister and i
never saw our parents again
it was just the two of us
but we learned a couple of things
while trapped in that house
one never walk into a house
made of candy
and two if youre gonna kill a witch
set her ass on fire
fresh milk fresh milk
for the children
keep your children healthy fresh milk
after weeks of living in fear
we have finally caught the one
responsible for all this terror
for crimes against
the city and people of augsburg
for crimes against
the city and people of augsburg
and for consorting with
the spawn of satan
i hereby accuse this woman
of the craft of witchery
burn her burn her
behold
the eyes of the demon
go to hell
order
order
berringer
this is still my town
listen to me
as your mayor i know only too well
that many of you
have lost precious loved ones to this
witch plague
but we cant just burn this woman
we first need evidence
we cant just have
you know a witch when you see one
they ride at night
and they make pacts with the devil
this woman will burn
burn her burn her
let the girl go
or im gonna blow your sheriffs brains
all over these fucking hillbillies
move go on
let her go go over there
check her
whats your name
whats your name
mina
dont worry
when a woman truly deals in witchcraft
she cannot hide it
a nasty rot sets in it shows in her teeth
in her skin and her eyes
this is not a witch this womans clean
im sure your sheriff was only trying
to protect you good people
but your mayor has done
a very smart thing
he hired us
my name is gretel
and this is my brother hansel
we know that many of your children
have gone missing
but killing an innocent woman
will not bring them back
go home we dont want you here
we dont want more evil in augsburg
well evil is upon you
whether you like it or not
now if your children are still alive
we will find them
but if anyone harms this woman
youre gonna have me to deal with
now go home
go
i guess youre free to go
thank you
hansel
youre welcome
what the hell do you think
youre doing huh
that woman is a suspect in my custody
you cant just come here
any man with half a brain
could see that she was not a witch
now listen sheriff
hansel and gretel
have been brought here
you better listen
im not going to have this bitch
and her scoundrel of a brother
coming into my town
telling me what to do
dont
just dont
come on lets get you started
theres been reports of
a strange cottage in the north forest
locals wont go near the place
a good place to start the investigation
move
gretel
she looks angry
yeah
a face like that id be angry too
would you shut up
that witch we found
was a dead end mayor
no trace of any kids im sorry
but we found this
that is called the blood moon mayor
an eclipse of the moon
it happens once in a generation
and is a night most holy to witches
oh my god
when
according to this
three nights from now
theres no doubt in my mind
that all this is connected
children being taken in these numbers
from the roads and fields
so close to town
a witch does not come out
in the open like that
not unless she has to
witch activity
has been increasing lately
more sightings
animal slaughter sabbaths
it seems the coming of the blood moon
is dragging every damned witch
from their dark hiding place
so
it seems like a good thing
that you brought us here
doesnt it mayor
half your money now
the rest when the children
are brought back alive
oh there he is right on time
this is jackson
he knows these woods inside and out
and hell take you to where
the last sightings were
yeah we can be there in a few hours
not at night its too dangerous
not at night its too dangerous
well leave in the morning
yeah shes right
its much too dangerous
so any place
we can get a drink in this hellhole
shut up
the last one they took was a boy
less than two days ago
so the scent is still fresh
100 shilling for every child
you return alive
you better be fast
before our mayors witch hunters
rob this town blind
you leave tonight
in witch country at night
you must be out of your mind
im telling you
we should put the fire out
were hunting witches
not bears and we have to eat
such beautiful creatures
are they yours
yes maam
why have you come here
to the dark of the forest
a child was taken maam
were here to find him
and take him back
there are no children here
here
theres only death
witch
fools
this is my land
how dare you
please
please god no
theres no use in praying my friend
even your god knows better
than to come here
there have been
abductions here and here
on both sides of the river
and on this last one
we believe a troll was involved
a troll
trolls are extra
another round
its really unusual look at this one
a father and three children attacked
one child was taken
but she didnt touch the other two
thats weird
thats so weird
it is strange it is strange okay
yeah yeah
then again
we hunt witches for a living
whats normal really
excuse me hansel and gretel
oh my god i cant believe youre here
im ben benjamin walser
i am really quite a fan of your work
thats great
its nice to meet you benjamin
listen if its not too much trouble
would you please sign
oh no
okay
oh my
yeah thats from when you
found the fox witch of antwerp
and sank her in the moat
and this ones from the
secret witch ring of belsen
when they tried to put a gate to
hell under the courthouse
i mean you guys you certainly
taught those witches a thing or two
wow
this is amazing and weird
a little creepy
yeah
you really keep all this stuff
all right well
i just have so many questions
do you mind
you know we have
oh no no
you go ahead
all right
okay how do you best kill a witch
hansel
cutting off their heads tends to work
ripping out their hearts
and skinning them is also nice
yeah but burning is the best way
cause thats the only way to be safe
burning yeah of course
burn them all
is it true that witches cant harm you
well no that is horseshit son
their magic doesnt work on us
and they havent killed us yet
do you think thats because of
the witch that you burned
when you were children
i guess thats how
it all started for you guys
i mean is that how
you became witch hunters
how did you get your guns
how did you get your weapons
okay okay
theres lots of things to do
youre a really nice kid
but we have a town under attack
she killed them
she killed them all
who killed what
the witch
she killed the trackers all of them
she gave me a message
for you all
the curse of hunger
for crawling things
i fucking hate that one
that was awesome
its working
its not even warm
muriel this could change everything
it will change everything
we will be invincible
take it out
take it out take it out
its of no use if it doesnt last
i can make it last
forever

requires a little bit more evidence
before someone gets roasted

i think thats you
and some sort of vicious badger
old beds
hansel
you ever wonder
what happened to our parents
we dont talk about that gretel
we made a promise you know that
why do you think
the witches spells dont work on us
leave it alone
this is our house
yeah
this is where we grew up
and what does that look like to you
i dont know gretel
we grew up over a witchs lair
so what so were cursed
no i think that our mother was
i see you finally found your way
home after all these years
how very sweet
i remember this house
the house of adrianna
the great white witch
your whore of a mother
let me tell you a little story
once upon a time
near a shitty little town
there was a farmer who fell
in love with a white witch
and with their two beautiful children
oh they were so happy
but not for long
during a blood moon there is a potion
that will make you immune to fire
the key to the potion
is the heart of a grand white witch
but your mother
the most powerful white witch
was too strong for us
so it had to be you gretel
it had to be your heart
as the blood moon approached
i sent out a little rumor
to the people of augsburg
and when she knew they were coming
she had your father take you
into the forest to hide you
father wait
dont let her get away
she didnt know what
they would do to her
but she was too proud to run
and a white witch would never use her
magic against humans
when your father came back for her
no
they hanged him
run him up
no
right in front
of your mothers burning flesh
adrianna was gone
but so was your heart
and the blood moon passed
the end
its a beautiful story dont you think
they died to save you
and all your life
how youve hated them
tomorrow
sisters from all dark corners of the land
will join me in the light
of the blood moon
for the greatest sabbath of all
the only thing left
is the everlasting power
of the heart
of a grand white witch
you know you talk too much
bad move witch hunter
hansel
drink it it will help the pain
mina
what did you do
mina
youre a witch
there are good witches in the world
not many but some
you stay back
im a witch but i wont hurt you
i checked you you were

mina how do i get there
if there is a sabbath
there will be many witches
theyll be too powerful
theyll kill you hansel
i dont have time for this

something very powerful
something that could help us
the abramelin grimoire it exists
this is the book
of protection against black magic
i cant believe this
where did you find it
dont ask kid
if this thing does what it says
it will allow us
to penetrate their protection
oh yeah
their wands wont
protect them anymore
we just need something to bless
