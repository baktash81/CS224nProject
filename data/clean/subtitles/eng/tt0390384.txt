and you re going to stay on the line 
you re not going to interrupt 
you re not going to speak for any reason 
now  some of this you know 
i m going to start at the top of the page 
meticulous  yes  methodical  educated 
they were these things 
nothing extreme  like anyone  they varied 
there were days of mistakes
and laziness and infighting 
and there were days  good days 
when by anyone s judgment   
they would have to be considered clever 
no one would say
that what they were doing was complicated 
it wouldn t even be considered new 
except maybe in the geological sense 
they took from their surroundings
what was needed   
and made of it something more 
  we haven t even set up an appointment 
  what order date did you put on this 
  the 28th  why 
  i don t know     yeah  i m putting 28th 
have you thought any more
about what you want to put forward 
  not really 
  because i was  
i mean i haven t changed my mind
or anything 
phillip and i were talking 
and we think it could be good  it d be fun 
nobody s saying it wouldn t be fun 
the time for jacking around with tesla coils
and ball lightning in the garage is over 
maybe you should try it on your own
in your free time 
my free time  the free time
after the 50 hours a week at work   
or after the 30 hours of free time
i already spend in that garage 
and it s not a tesla coil 
i could save a few minutes a day
by eating on the toilet 
how many patents do we have 
in the last 14 months 
  did you sign the agreement 
  nobody signed the agreement 
doesn t matter 
we re sticking to the agreement 
name one thing out of that garage
that s remotely profitable 
i don t see anybody quitting their jobs
because of it  are you 
abe just means that right now
the jtag cards are it 
when you look at the addresses  we have
a lot of apartments  a lot of residences 
but these are not the bulk orders
to the oems or retail giants 
  these are the quiet basement  
  hackers 
yeah  hacker wannabes
testing their dads  old motherboards 
and i know that a lot of that is my fault 
admittedly  you know 
with everything last year  and the doubletalk
we were getting from platts   
  and all the stuff we won t get into now  
  we should get into it 
i m sorry  what 
go ahead  tell him 
we should get into it 
i talked to my brother today 
he knows of two other cases like that
at his firm 
  let platts know that we re talking about it 
  look  forget platts 
this has got to be about what
has the best chance of going to market   
and what is going to get us vc attention 
look  i stuck by you guys
when it was your turn 
and i wasn t 100  sure
of what we were doing   
or even if i didn t agree  maybe 
but if it s my turn   
if we re still playing by the rules 
then this is what i want to try 
here  take it 
they said it wouldn t hold a freeze 
robert  please  it s not going to hold 
  it s going to go bad in my car 
  it ll go bad here  okay  thanks 
  good night  all 
  see you 
  we just got done giving this huge speech  
  we gave the speech 
we just got done  it was five minutes ago 
i m the one that forced the issue  they re
onto us because i suck as the bad cop 
  you should do it  you could fake it better 
  i don t know about that 
as long as we re going down this road
where it s eighth grade physics   
and happy fun time out in that garage 
i think we could stand to try this 
phillip and robert are gung ho on theirs 
and that s fine 
but you know i have no interest in that 
i know you have no interest 
besides the fact   
that phillip and robert don t even need us 
they just want to use the equipment 
for what i want to do  we don t need them 
not even phillip 
because it doesn t need software 
  is she asleep 
  no  and she needs a bath 
  she ll wind up in the closet if i do it 
  that s fine 
you know  even if robert s okay with it 
and he won t be 
  i don t understand what that thing will do 
  we ll let them go at it for two months 
  they do theirs  we do ours 
  they said it d take 14 hours 
don t eat that  seriously  it s bad 
we threw the first couple of batches out 
the filter 
what about crushed 
these guys are funded 
  these guys are     what 
  liquid helium  these guys are funded 
that s what this is 
that s the whole difference 
that s what the box is 
we don t have to play the game
where we re going back and forth   
coming up with innovative ways to make it
colder and unusable in the process 
  aaron  i need the hexagonal set 
  this is unmarketable 
by coming at it from the back end 
rather than changing   
the surrounding temperature 
we ll change the level it ll conduct   
the transition temperature 
and by bombarding these edges  
they re dropping the ceramic 
the temperature lower and lower 
it makes the ceramic less resistant
and knocks out the interior magnetic field 
what i m saying is
we drop the box down on it 
focus our own magnetic field to negate 
knock out with the inverse   
what s going on inside the ceramic 
that should change the transition
temperature to something we can work with 
  what are we saying that is 
  hopefully  near room temperature 
what is that about 
the best mathematician is a lazy one 
  what did you ask for 
  i asked  i need the hexagonal set 
  what did you call it 
  just come on 
  are these type one 
  the superconductors 
yeah  they re type one 
is that going to be a problem 
there s plenty lying around at work 
but they re all bar coded 
  lf i have to  i ll buy the kits 
  what are you doing about the source 
what 
  i can get them 
  you can     are you sure 
i thought you didn t like this idea 
buy them if you have to 
everything else we can take care of 
what about the source here 
you know that story
about how nasa spent millions   
developing this pen that writes in zero g 
did you ever read that 
  and how russia solved the problem 
  yeah  they used a pencil 
right  a normal wooden pencil 
it just seems like phillip takes
the nasa route almost every time 
  palladium 
  you ve got their diagram  what does it say 
they use a ratio of platinum and palladium 
that s not necessary
with the changes i made 
they re just showing off 
if you have it  use it 
i want to get a replacement router 
  i m putting down four ounces of palladium 
  did robert look at it 
  i already got his 
  i can t fix it 
  okay  where are you getting it 
  wal mart  it s  50 
  okay  can you get a receipt  please 
  yeah 
wait  platinum or palladium
is less resistant 
  abe  it s not a  
  yeah  i don t care 
  so resistance doesn t matter 
  i need an aye or a yes 
  did you jiggle the  
  the collet nut 
  robert did it 
  well  yes  i guess 
  well  then  which is cheaper 
  you re not going to buy it  are you 
well  unless you ve got
a few grams of palladium lying around 
why would they put it in there
if you didn t need it 
one catalytic converter  it s fine 
remember to put it back 
your emission just went up 300  
  is there enough in here 
  yeah  should be 
if not  we ll pull the one out of my truck 
okay  coppertubing 
  this will be out of commission  right 
  without the tubing 
  we can use the freon  too 
  no  it s going to be room temperature 
i know  just in case 
no  wait  stop  i ll just buy the tubing 
this isn t saving us money 
  jay  hey  man  how are you 
  good 
should we be wearing goggles 
  should we be wearing goggles 
  what 
goggles  should we be wearing goggles 
wait  phillip  you don t want
to come out here 
phillip  grab a mask  okay 
it is  though  right  it s not just me 
no  it s definitely smaller  but it just seems
that way  take what they have 
minus the coolant which we don t need 
the rest of it is the mercury bath   
which you would know better than i do 
but they re probably just showing off 
i mean  you have it  you got to use it  right 
  what  does it hurt 
  no  i didn t feel anything 
that sound is just weirding me out 
  what does it feel like 
  i don t know 
i don t know if i m making it up 
here 
  next part  let s do the next part 
  yeah 
isn t there some sort of glass
or a transparent    
anything we can use as a window  pyrex 
  yeah  i m in 
  okay  drop it 
i don t know of anything
that won t leave a gap in the field 
but we got to see what s going on in there 
  how much did that cost 
  yeah 
  what 
  you want to put my camcorder   
inside the box that s so dangerous
we can t look into it 
if something happens 
would you pay me back 
so we have a slightly negative pressure
in the box 
so we re ready for the argon 
  which one is that 
  it s the blue one 
i weighed it at 77 grams 
i set the scale to decagrams  though 
i m showing 7 7 decagrams 
ready for   
0 05 liters of argon 
  you ready 
  just the plate first  right 
right  first just the plate  and then we ii    
let s just give it a second 
  you want to do the box now 
  yeah 
let s go through the checklist 
aaron  hold on a second 
let s make sure everything s set up right 
hold on  aaron  wait 
just wait 
okay 
anything 
  is this normal 
  i don t know 
  i m turning it off 
  wait  no 
  okay  i didn t do that 
  did we blow something 
yeah  we did  that s destroyed 
  you want to check your camera 
  yeah 
  let s get this 
  you ready 
one  two  three 
hey  tell me you re hungry 
kara s at her mom s and i m starving 
yeah  i m hungry  what    
abe  it s 7 00  abe  it s 7 00 at night 
  okay  yeah  i have food  
  okay 
  wait  are those kids there 
  just a sec 
yeah  they re here 
okay  screw that  let s just go somewhere 
i just pulled in  so come on down 
come up first  i have some stuff
i want to take back to the shop 
all right  but meet me at the door 
  okay  all right 
  seriously  meet me at the door 
okay  all right  see you 
  what s up  abe 
  hey  brad  how are you 
good 
  how long did he say he would be there 
  not long 
if he s got problems  he s got to fix them 
you re not his dad 
i know  i just thought it would be good
to do something charitable 
it definitely is charity 
at least you admit that 
you feel like a steak  to eat 
i don t want a steak  let s just
grab some tacos on the way to the shop 
  i have some stuff i want to try out 
  okay 
we can get some tacos on the way 
or we can get a steak afterwards 
what are you talking about 
i m not paying for a steak 
it s stable 
aaron  it s stable 
  what did you do to this thing 
  what 
  it looks like a dog digested it 
  okay  that s the plate 
i rigged this into the box
so i could control the feed 
  i figured it s the easiest way  
  it s just controlling the box 
the plate stays the same 
what you do is you gradually feed it 
okay  you hear that  how it s    
see  i m not touching it anymore 
it s growing with its own momentum 
it s like a feedback loop 
and it just regulates itself 
and what you do is when it gets there 
you bring it back   
and there you go  it coasts 
it s stable  it stays like that 
so it works 
  yeah  it does 
  what is that  like 10  
it knocks another couple of points
by the time it reaches the peak 
you may want to come over here
and take a look at this 
okay  what am i looking at 
  what are we pulling out of the batteries 
  probably 24 volts 
  i mean  no more than that  right 
  okay 
so your meter s jacked up 
that s what i figured  so i tried three others 
i got the exact same thing 
  i spent all last night  
  what was it 
i spent last night and a two hour break
just double checking everything 
there s something wrong here  we re not
pulling out more than we re putting in 
  slightly more 
  well  yeah  whatever 
it s not like a volt and a half
more than we re putting in 
it s probably the batteries 
they re cheap batteries  not regulated right 
that is weird  though 
you want to see something weirder 
okay  let s go over this again 
two batteries  right  24 volts 
what are we pulling out of this one 
just for fun 
twelve volts 
  how about this one 
  should be 12 volts 
so  what the hell is this thing 
it doesn t stay like that 
no  it winds down in a few minutes 
what does that 
i don t know  i ll tell them something 
i ll tell them we re spraying for bugs 
it should just be a day or two  anyways 
  unless you want to bring them in 
  no  they have their work in there  too 
if phillip finds out about that
he s going to have to take it apart 
  no  i m just putting a little tweak on it 
  yeah  i know  no  you re right 
abe  it s my garage  okay 
it s not like they re paying rent 
there was value in the thing 
clearly  of that they were certain of 
but what is the application 
in a matter of hours   
they had pinned it to everything
from mass transit to satellite launching 
imagining devices the size of jumbo jets 
everything would be cheaper 
it was practical and they knew it 
but above all that  beyond the positives   
they knew that the easiest way
to be exploited   
is to sell something
they did not yet understand 
so they kept quiet 
the parties would continue 
any birthday  anniversary  holiday   
maybe some obscure project launch 
it didn t matter  any reason would do 
what was important is that thomas granger 
their last best hope of funding  show up 
if he left a little earlier than
they would ve liked  he couldn t be blamed 
he was only there
to please his daughter rachel 
and she was only there to please abe 
what did you say
to mr  granger a while ago 
  did you flip my burger 
  you can t call him mr  granger 
you have to call him  like 
thomas or something 
  go ahead 
  no  because he won t take you seriously 
  he thinks we re kids 
  lf you call him mr  granger   
he looks at you like you re a 6 year old kid 
he does it with me  it won t work anymore 
abe had taken on the task
of quantifying and explaining the device 
but as weeks became months   
their enthusiasm became a slow realization
that they were out of their depth 
there he is 
i ve been calling you all morning 
  where d you call 
  your work and your cell 
i m not there 
really 
  march madness 
  it s carolina and michigan 
  who s up 
  i don t even know what 
do you have anything important
at work today 
i hope you re not implying
that any day is unimportant at cortex semi 
i was going to come give you
this big speech about how we ve been   
friends for a long time and built up trust 
that whole thing 
but how about this instead 
if you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things i ask you   
i will in return show you
the most important thing   
that any living organism has ever witnessed 
well  it looks like mustard to me 
i know  but it s a film  it s a protein   
secreted by a fungus
called aspergillus ticor 
he told you that 
no  he knew it was a protein
but didn t know where it came from 
all he really did was just take some pictures
with their equipment 
guess where we re going 
  do you know where will is 
  no  why 
the ariel meeting
is pushed back till wednesday 
i thought he was waiting around for it 
where are you going 
what do they do with engineers
when they turn 40 
  what  bradshaw 
  exactly  you know what 
i do know where will is 
i ll let him know on my way out 
  okay  thanks 
  can you meet me out front 
  you got to drive 
  okay  here  take my keys 
okay  if you can  just pretend
that this is the first time i came in 
and if you would just
tell him exactly what you told me    
  okay  so what is it 
  protein buildup 
  okay  can you just tell him 
  protein buildup 
  but what kind 
  some fungus 
  some fungus 
  where did it come from 
  i don t know  you were to take it to the lab 
  yeah  that s next 
  you were in design  weren t you 
  yeah 
how did you get over here 
do you know what they do
with engineers when they turn 40 
they take them out and shoot them 
what the hell  abe 
you could have just shown me the pictures 
  i want you to believe it 
  believe what  the protein 
  i believe you 
  okay  look   
this guy already thinks it s a joke 
so he may be a little defensive 
really  why would he think that 
please 
aspergillus ticor 
this is a fungus that s everywhere 
it s in our bed  our skin 
sometimes even our gi tract  everywhere 
it s basically the reason you don t leave
things in dark  damp  closed off places 
thank you 
do you have that sample i brought 
there it is  terger  t e r g e r 
okay  when i showed you this 
tell him what you thought 
  you thought it was a joke  right 
  it is a joke 
right  but how did you know 
will you show him  please 
this is how i get protein a
out of aspergillus ticor  we sweeten it 
we agitate it  we spin it around 
we sweeten some more 
  takes about a month 
  to get the same amount i brought in 
to get the same amount i brought in 
so if it s an incubator for fungus 
is that valuable 
  that s not what it is 
  then what is it 
there s another way to secrete
that much protein  do it naturally 
but that takes a lot longer 
if it has a little moisture and it s left alone 
it ll start secreting and it ll build up   
  and build up  but it takes a long time 
  how long 
  a long time 
  more than a few days  then how long 
to get the same amount of protein
that we have   
the amount that i was wiping off
every five days   
and five days later it would accumulate   
he says it would take about five to six years 
i don t want to belittle this guy 
so  i said screw it
and i put my watch in there 
  and 
  i want you to do it 
  where is it  the box 
  i took it back to the shop 
  wait  digital or old mechanical 
  exactly  i did both 
  and what 
  i want you to do it 
we thought
that we were degrading gravity  right 
that we were blocking that information 
i think we re doing more than that 
i think we re blocking more than that 
when you were controlling the feed 
did you notice it was parabolic 
it s important  parabolas are important 
here  look at this 
i don t know  abe 
i m going to start it up
and let it run for 60 seconds   
with nothing in it  it s empty this time 
that s 22  
in all the equations that describe motion
and heat and entropy 
in all feynman diagrams what s the
one variable that you can turn negative   
and still get rational answers for 
it s not mass 
twenty two hours  27 minutes in the box 
  it s an odd number 
  that s 1 347 minutes 
  1 347  man  you got that fast 
  how did you know it s odd 
because this is it  this is what s going on 
there s an  a  end and a  b  end 
let s say the a end is 12 00 and the b end is 12 01 
all right  we start the machine
with the weeble at the a end 
  it travels forward  
  you got to write this down 
  there s nothing to write down 
  i ll write it down 
it travels forward normally
towards the b end 
when it gets there 
the feed runs down parabolically   
until it should stop  but it curves
back around towards the a end 
when it gets back to the a end    
curve that around  the weeble   
has experienced a total of two minutes 
and again it curves  
  back around  it curves parabolically 
  right 
it comes back around
and it does this about 1 300 times 
when it finally exits on the b end   
it s traveled an odd number
of forward and backward trips 
what is so special about 1 300 
why is it about 1 300  why isn t it exact 
  this is not empirical 
  here  give me that 
i don t know why it s not exact 
there s some sort of probability there 
every time it hits the b end
there s a chance   
a small chance it won t
curve back around towards the a end 
and for some reason  it takes
about 1 300 trips before it finally does 
it does have to exit  or else
we wouldn t be able to see it afterwards 
okay  let s take a look at this 
twenty two hours  14 minutes 
  1 334 minutes 
  even 
enter at the b end 
exit at the b end 
  i just want you to see it the way i saw it 
  i am trying  okay 
everything we re putting in that box
comes ungrounded 
and i don t mean grounded to the earth 
i mean not tethered 
we re blocking whatever keeps it
moving forward  so they flip flop 
inside the box  it s like a street 
and both ends are cul de sacs 
this isn t frame dragging or wormhole
matching  it s basic mechanics and heat 
this is not mechanics and heat 
  we can publish 
  yeah  we can publish 
no  i mean we can really publish 
aaron  the weeble s stupid  it can t move 
even if we were
to put the weeble in at point b   
it s still going to bounce back and forth
until it s kicked out at the b end 
but if it were smart   
it could enter at the b end
and exit at the a end before it flips back 
you re talking about making a bigger one 
i didn t say anything 
you re the one talking about it 
so  you believe me 
no  i don t 
come on  let s go get a drink or something 
  we re going to have to move it 
  we will 
we need a box big enough for a person
to fit into  as far as turning it on  
i was testing the box  it turns out
over half the rings are redundant 
the inner ring is strong enough on its own 
so it makes the plate smaller 
a lot more is unnecessary 
what we can do   
is take a lot of these small plates and
surround a container with a web of them 
how small 
it should be accumulative so a lot of
mini fields equal one big one  right 
yeah  sum of series  that makes sense 
what i was going to say is we need
to find a place where we can put it   
and turn it on and it won t be disturbed 
we could just lock it in a closet 
someplace where someone s not going to
go poking around and messing with it 
and climate controlled 
yeah  so whatever  we ll find some place 
so  if we go your route with what 
a bunch of mini fields 
that s a lot of work  we d have to    
i mean  how many days is that 
abe  you know what we could use 
i know we ve seen
a lot of crazy things lately  okay 
i know you re still trying to put
it all together in a way that makes sense 
look  i just want you to understand
that what s next is not a prank  okay 
i wouldn t do that to you
and i m not doing that to you 
so when you see this  you can t yell
or make any noise or run anywhere 
i know you probably feel like you re
being tricked or made fun of  but you re not 
i promise you  you re not  okay 
who was that  abe 
let s just wait  six minutes 
look  you sure you re okay to drive 
what did you do all day 
the first time through 
i spent the day in a hotel room
in russellfield 
  i ll just meet you back at the shop 
  i wonder what i did 
  i guess i went back to work 
  yeah  probably 
probably just worked  i guess 
yeah  probably so 
look  now that i know about this  abe   
don t do this again  okay 
not where it affects me 
go ahead 
hey  rachel 
why not the lottery 
we can if you want 
but it s not until saturday 
and even if we win the full  10 million 
that s only  200 000 for the next 30 years 
  and that s just one good trade 
  a couple days like this 
  i was just running a test  in and out 
  i want to do what you did 
exactly what you did 
  the first thing i did is call in sick 
  okay  i did that 
  then i drove to the storage facility 
  but i need to drop lauren at school first 
then meet me there 
we re going to need both cars 
we need to park yours down the road 
out of sight of the facility 
  why are we doing that 
  because we need a ride home 
  what is that    
  it ll make sense 
okay  i ll be patient 
when i got to the storage room 
i flooded the box with argon   
and i had to tighten it up
to secure the leaks 
  there s leaks 
  there s always leaks 
at 8 30 a m   i set the timer for 15 minutes   
i jumped in the car 
and drove to russellfield 
okay  i lost it 
  what 
  why the timer 
because the moment we start those
machines is the moment we ll end up   
  getting out of them  and  
  right  got it  sorry 
i don t want to be standing around
when they do 
while i was on the road at 8 45 
the machine kicked on by itself   
and by 8 49  it was completely warmed up 
in russellfield  i got a hotel room
and tried to isolate myself 
wait  what do you mean  isolate  
i closed the windows 
i unplugged everything in the room   
the telephone  tv  clock  radio  everything 
i didn t want to take the chance
of running into someone i knew   
or seeing something on the news
that might    
if we re dealing with causality 
and i don t even know for sure 
  i just    
  what 
  took myself out of the equation 
  err on the side of caution 
yes 
then what did you do all day 
  i just sat there  i had some books  but    
  what  were you nervous 
yeah 
it s mind numbing  all the second guessing 
 evacipate  
at 3 30 p m  
i stopped by williams medical supply 
picked up a class e oxygen tank and mask 
i called my mutual fund company and asked
which stock in their mid cap fund   
had the greatest percentage gain that day 
the idea was just to get enough information
for one good trade 
can we just download chart data
and trade on each movement 
but if we do that  i want to use the library
in russellfield  use their computers 
so  i got to the storage room at about 3 15
and cut off the power to the box 
it cycled down to a tolerable level
at about 3 19 
the trick is to get in
after it reaches a comfortable level   
but before it shuts off completely 
there s a window there 
so  does it hurt 
yeah  it does a little 
it s not bad if you wait for the right time 
it s like a small static shock 
  once you re in  you re fine  though 
  what 
i know you ve done it 
and i can only assume that you don t have   
cancer or male impotence 
but what is your opinion
on how safe this thing is 
i can imagine no way
in which this thing would be   
considered anywhere remotely close to safe 
all i know is i spent six hours in there
and i m still alive 
you still want to do it 
i set the alarm on my stopwatch
for six hours 
i regulated the o2 tank 
took some dramamine  and tried to sleep 
did you 
  what 
  did you sleep 
not at first  i ve never
considered myself claustrophobic   
but i started sweating and i couldn t find
the right flow rate on the tank   
and i was breathing differently than i was
when i was testing it on the outside 
eventually  i settled down  and   
i don t know  maybe it was the dramamine
kicking in  but i remember this moment   
in the dark
with the reverberation of the machine 
it was maybe the most content
i ve ever been 
i woke up on my own without the alarm   
and waited for the machine to cool down 
cool down from my perspective 
it got to a point where it sounded safe
to get out   
but the stopwatch still showed
a couple minutes   
so i trusted the math and waited 
that s not a static shock  abe 
okay  please stop it 
you got out too soon 
you have to wait for the stopwatch
so that you know the gain is low enough 
so  we re back here 
yeah  we re here 
it s 8 50  tuesday morning 
all right  give me a few minutes 
from there it was easy 
the bulk of the work was done 
i just left everything the way i found it 
i left the machine alone   
and didn t turn it off 
and just cleared out of there 
so your double would find everything
the same later that day and get in the box 
right  but also  i or my double or someone
was in the box coming backwards 
so who knows what that would ve done
if i d turned the machine off 
definitely  so  they re one time use only 
so then  at that moment  since my double
was on the way to the hotel in my car   
i had to take a taxi home  but when we go 
we ll be able to use your truck 
  you have a margin account  right 
  yeah  i do now  what are we buying 
good  today  before 12 30  we ll buy
as many shares as we can of rgwu 
they ll say their earnings that quarter
are three and a half times consensus   
and the stock will nearly double
in afternoon trading 
  what do they do 
  what do you mean 
what does this company do 
do they make things or  
i don t know 
all that matters is the price goes up 
the volume is so high that the number
of shares we trade won t affect the price 
you really don t know what they do 
that s why you spoke about a mid cap fund 
so volume is high enough to hide us 
  do you think it s too cautious 
  i don t know 
i know there s a lot of other stocks
out there   
that do a lot more than double 
but this is my first day 
  my god 
  she s not going to answer 
i know  abe  that s the question 
i know  so what s the answer 
you ve got the  400 billion   
you ve gone the charity route 
you have this perfect 100 room mansion   
with matching his and her yachts
and helicopter pads 
basically  you have absolute impunity
to do whatever you want   
nobody can touch you 
  you re back from a two year  
  above the law 
absolutely  well above  you re fresh back
from this two year world galloping vacation 
how do you fill your day  what do you do 
abe  i know that s the question  but it s not
a real question  so why does it matter 
so what s the answer 
babe  he knows that s the question  okay 
he s asking you the question 
what do you mean  what would i do
with my life or what would i do tomorrow 
my god  either 
i d have to do something constructive 
i d have to do something that would help   
  something that would make me feel good 
  i know  that s fantastic  good 
  my wife  so good  so pure  you are pure 
  shut up  why did you ask  then 
this is what i would do 
i would wake up tomorrow morning   
and i d go over to gabriel capital inc   
and i would tell joseph platts  receptionist
that i m there to see him   
and when he comes out   
i would ram my fist
through the flat of his nose 
just one good punch  one good pow 
  that s amazing  it s about time 
  that is so great 
where did this come from 
you re always defending the guy 
  it s unnatural 
  i d only do it if i knew that   
no one would find out or get hurt 
like  i wish that there was a way
that i could do it   
and then i go back and tell myself not to 
because i just want to know
what it feels like  that s all  really 
i m so proud 
finally  my husband  the hero 
  we can t do that 
  i know 
did you call pest control 
babe  they re birds  you don t want a bunch
of dead baby birds up there  do you 
  they don t sound like birds 
  she thinks there are rats in the attic 
but the idea had been spoken   
and the words wouldn t go back
after they had been uttered aloud 
so you are understanding this  right 
you don t have to sell me
on not doing this  okay 
  i don t think i told you  
  even if you do stop yourself   
your double  from hitting platts 
why would he  your double  get in the box 
and with no need for it 
no possible real world application   
no advantage at all to be gained from it 
the idea stayed 
  how would you do it 
  i wouldn t 
  just for fun 
  i still wouldn t 
  but what if there was a way to  
  look  abe  look 
i m not going to pretend
like i know anything about paradoxes   
or what follows them  and honestly 
i really don t believe in that crap 
kill your mom before you were born 
whatever  it has to work itself out somehow 
  i don t know 
  this is what i know for sure 
the worst thing in the world is to know
that the moment you are experiencing   
has already been defined 
that this is the second   
or third time through  or whatever 
and do you everfeel like    
i don t know  maybe things aren t right 
like maybe your life is in disarray   
or just not what you would like
and you start to wonder what caused this 
people are always blaming their parents   
as if  if their mom had breastfed them 
their lives would be different 
bunch of whiners 
yeah  they are  but what if it wasn t
something you wonder about 
what if you knew this is not the way
things are supposed to be 
i m not like that  i m not into the whole
 destiny  there s only one right way  thing 
i m not  either  but what s worse 
thinking you re being paranoid
or knowing you should be 
you don t have to look at me like that 
i m okay 
no  i just assumed that you would 
i trust her 
  i know that when i decided to tell you  
  decided to tell 
i knew that you are married and that there s
no secrets  anything i tell you  she ll know 
  it s not a matter of trust 
  i know 
it s just how much better will it be
if in a few days   
i surprise her and we all just fly
to costa rica or somewhere for a month 
we ll let her understand it gradually 
maybe do some real estate shopping  
for now  you can tell her
you had a good day in the market 
  you don t understand 
  no 
you don t understand the questions
that come with that 
but we ll explain it to her 
and we ll take some time   
to figure out what s next   
which  i think  should be building
a bigger box  like the size of a room   
where more than one person could fit in 
safe or not 
the thing feels like a coffin the way it is 
by the way  this is our guy 
  what s the volume 
  five and a half 
what s the return  holy    
no  i can t beat that  but mainly  i guess
i was just talking about robert and phillip 
i don t want to tell them 
i know they have a lot invested
in the group  
i don t want to tell them 
if you need me to take the guilt on this one 
fine  okay 
i accept it gladly  it s mine 
at the end of this week 
they can have whatever they want 
i ll turn over patent rights on everything
from the last two years 
they can have the equipment 
the garage  the house 
they can have my truck
if that makes you feel better 
but i am not telling them a thing
about this  we re not 
god  everything is so different in there 
you can feel how cut off you are 
it s this entirely separate world
and you encompass most of it 
and the sound 
isn t the sound different on the inside 
it s like it s singing 
i guess you can t hear it on the outside  
  i had this dream in there 
  about what 
i was on or near the ocean 
and i just kept hearing the surf 
it was so uneventful 
at night 
and the tide kept coming in and out 
come here for a second  man 
what s on your hand 
  are you bleeding 
  that is blood 
  turn around 
  you see it 
where is it coming from  it s your notebook 
  it s you  my gosh  it s on your ear 
  what is this 
  your ear s bleeding  man 
  give me that  i got it 
  is that normal  this isn t normal 
  for the machine 
for people 
you think it s the machine  i got it 
great  i can actually
get some work done today 
hi  guys  what s going on 
i always seem to get a lot more done
when i m not locked out 
he says they had to spray again 
but he can t tell us about it in advance 
is hero even here 
you never see anything around here
but those geckos 
  i know 
  i think it s for the geckos 
  what 
  why 
  hey  man  thanks for the present 
  how is that working out for you 
you know what  you guys  both of you 
you make fun  but there is a difference 
wait  what did you call him 
  what 
  when you walked in  what did you say 
  he didn t tell you about it 
  no 
all right  rachel s ex boyfriend
walks into my birthday party with a shotgun 
  what 
  swear to god 
i ve already gotten that speech from kara 
  filby 
  you ll get it  you have a wife and kid 
it s funny how you two are the only people
that have a problem with it 
  everybody else thinks i did a good thing 
  you didn t 
you can t risk your life and
especially the welfare of kara and lauren   
for someone like rachel 
she practically begs
for this to happen to her 
i figured at least you d understand 
understand what 
you ve never been like this 
that s what i mean 
you see how different things are now 
different  how are things different 
you see it  okay  i know you do 
look  that was the night   
you had told me everything
about the machine 
everything you showed me was so fresh
in my head and when i saw this guy   
i m looking at him 
i wasn t going to let him do that 
i wasn t going
to let him scare people like that 
i know it was stupid  okay 
but i mean  this whole idea 
this whole thing that we re doing 
it just took some getting used to for me 
i wasn t completely acclimated to it 
if it was just you  you had to worry about 
i d still think you re stupid 
but you have a family now 
and god  especially now   
anything like this would be crazy 
  i know  okay 
  i know you know that  but you ve got to    
  i know  okay 
  filby 
you little sack of    
even if you see him  don t tell me 
it s not my fault if i don t know 
and i just hope the thing runs away 
then what are we doing out here 
she worries about the cat 
so you look for the cat  it s what you do 
  i don t know 
  what do you mean 
it s embarrassing that the storage room guy
sees us come in together   
but he never sees us leave 
yeah  but what do you think
the receptionist thinks   
about two guys that come
and get a room for six hours every day 
did you unplug this 
you brought your cell phone 
can i check the caller id 
yeah  we re not back 
yeah  but you can t take it back
with you  okay 
this is aaron  hey  babe 
i m not there  i had to come downtown
and hold some of these guys  hands 
tell me 
that sounds good 
no  i ve got to eat with these offsite fags 
save mine  though  i ll have it later 
okay  yeah  6 00 
  what 
  what 
we re supposed to win this by two 
they just turned over with 12 on the clock 
  we have to foul 
  no 
what  no  we foul here 
they miss the first free throw   
  and they come back with the three 
  three points 
that s right 
man  are you hungry 
i haven t eaten since later this afternoon 
what s up  you guys 
  you have got to be kidding 
  i m sorry  i forgot it was in my pocket 
  it s kara 
  yeah 
how do cell phones work 
if there s two duplicate phones
and i call the same number   
do they both ring at the same time 
or is there    
  that s not how they work 
  it s a radio signal 
no  it s a network 
it checks each area and
when it finds the phone  it stops ringing 
it rings the first one 
  this one is ringing 
  right 
so the one your double has in russellfield
can t be 
right  i think we broke symmetry 
  are you sure that s how cell phones work 
  no 
you feel all right 
  i feel fine  do you 
  yeah 
is kara asleep  did i wake you up 
yeah  no  not me  it felt more like a nap 
i think my body s getting used to
these 36 hour days  what s going on 
we can do this  but we have to do it now 
  do you have his home address 
  why now 
we were planning on taking a trip
tomorrow  right  just like today 
yeah  for stocks 
okay  well  half an hour ago i was asleep 
this car alarm woke me up 
these kids were down skating by 
hitting cars on the block 
so we go right now  do our business
at platts   get back in the box   
and come back before
those kids set off those alarms 
all we really have to do is stand there
in plain sight  that should scare them off 
that way my double
sleeps through the night   
they don t have this conversation 
and they get in the box tomorrow as usual 
  they ll be changed  but  
  yeah  but at least they ll get in the box 
wait  how do we go back that far
if the machines haven t been running 
  have they been running 
  yeah 
i started going by at 5 00 and turning them on  5 00 p m 
i got tired of the whole
unanswerable question  
are we doing this as an experiment
or are we doing this for me 
  a little of both 
  5 00 
if we get this done by 3 00 
that s 10 hours in the box 
i ve got the o2 tanks in the car 
  is that    
  is that rachel s car 
no  that s not rachel s  that s her dad s 
they have the same kind 
did you see that 
that s mr  granger  that s thomas 
he s sitting in that car 
what 
i swear that was him 
what the hell is he doing   
sitting outside my house
at 2 00 in the morning 
i don t believe this 
what  is he following us 
  what are you doing 
  let s just see what he wants 
no  let s just get out
of my neighborhood first  come on 
  did you see him today 
  no 
i did  i saw him this afternoon   
around 6 00 
are you sure you didn t see him
when we drove past 
no  what 
i m positive this afternoon
he was clean shaven  i know he was 
he was ready to go to some function
with his wife 
he looks like he s got
a two or three day growth now 
  are you sure 
  no  i m not sure  but i think so 
rachel  this is abe  did i wake you up 
can i get your dad s number
from you real quick 
yeah  okay  go ahead 
  yeah  thanks 
  what s he doing 
he s just sitting there 
he got out for a second
and i thought he was coming over   
and then he got back in the car 
i think he s drunk 
hi  sorry to call so late 
may i speak to thomas granger  please 
yeah  this is james miller
from putney and myers 
hi  mr  granger 
thomas granger 
what are you doing here  come here 
what happened 
i m okay  i slipped 
i want to know what box he used 
you built one for you  right  just one 
yeah  how many do you think i made 
these are set right  i turned them on at 5 00 
he could have used one
and gone back to 5 00 
he could be in one of them right now 
i say we shut them off
and see if he s in there 
were you planning on talking to him 
just tell me if you were 
i m not going to be mad 
no  i promise you  you know i wouldn t 
are you sure you wouldn t 
you re the one he can t get near
without passing out 
there is no way
i would tell anyone about this  no way 
  can you think of any reason you might 
  no 
sometimes we do things
but don t know how we got to that point 
  no  i can t 
  can t what 
i can t think of any reason why i would 
well  i can t either 
what if it was an emergency 
  so you d do it if it was an emergency 
  no  i don t know  what  so you might then 
i don t know  what kind of emergency 
the permutations were endless 
they tried again going to the source   
but even while keeping him separated
from abe by two rooms   
ask him his name 
   granger s condition
could only be described as vegetative 
what did he say 
from this they deduced
that the problem was recursive   
but beyond that  found themselves
admitting  against their own nature   
and once again 
that the answer was unknowable 
  what do you think he changed 
  not much 
we didn t have any contact with him
in the 3 hours he could ve done anything 
i know he changed this  i know we weren t
having this conversation the first time   
so you don t know what we lost 
it really could not have been much 
it doesn t matter how much 
it just matters that it s changed 
i know what you re saying 
the question should have been   
what to do with the comatose man
in the guest bedroom 
but in abe s mind
he was already compiling the list 
two mg of oral triazolam   
every seven hours induces a safe sleep state
and a minimal metabolic rate 
at this continued state of rest   
the human body breathes
0 3 liters of oxygen a minute   
or roughly 2 000 liters in four days 
a class e oxygen tank holds 625 liters 
to maintain hydration   
the body cycles through a minimum
of two and a half liters of water per day 
any food would be a luxury   
but the small tank
of medical grade nitrous oxide   
would be needed on the other side 
past the room that contained their machines
and up two levels   
he made his way to another room   
where he had stored what i will refer to
from here on as the failsafe machine 
there he is 
i ve been calling you all morning 
really 
your cell and work 
i m not there 
really 
i don t even know what 
i m just tired 
i hope you re not implying
that any day is unimportant at cortex semi 
i was going to come give you
this big speech about how we ve been   
friends for a long time and built up trust 
that whole thing 
but how about this instead 
if you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things i ask you   
i will in return show you
the most important thing   
that any living organism has ever witnessed 
at this point
there would have been some discussion 
abe would  of course  want to know how 
aaron would have to explain
all about the storage manifest   
and how it showed two rooms
under the name abram terger 
then abe would need to know how 
aaron would explain
that when he went up there   
and found the failsafe running   
he knew exactly what it was 
but abe would ask how 
and then the bit
about the modular design of the coffins   
and how it meant he could fold one up
and take it back inside another 
they are not one time use only 
they are recyclable  aaron would say 
how  abe would ask 
and aaron would describe
how simple things become   
when you know precisely
what someone will have for breakfast   
even in a world of tamper proof lids 
how 
and that s where
i would have entered the story 
or exited  depending on your reference 
because when aaron came back
the second time  it wasn t so easy 
he wasn t expecting me to put up a fight 
and by that time 
he was too exhausted to take me 
but for reasons
that are only evident to me now   
i understood that he simply wanted it more 
that he just had more invested  so i left 
he had already performed the task 
as i had intended to   
of recording the conversations of the day
just in case 
through that earpiece
he had a three second lead on the world 
aaron  you need some sleep 
some real sleep 
i can t  i ve got a schedule 
he had but to speak aloud the words
that came into his head   
and those around him would fall in line 
this is track 3 
abe is bringing my car around
and i am on my way to the court 
i ll see will there 
i ll invite him to the party and make sure
he s bringing rachel s boyfriend 
will 
you pretentious prick 
what the hell is that 
is that your cell phone 
  no  it s a radio  man 
  you look like secret service 
  you look like secret service 
  ariel meeting is moved to wednesday 
what  what the hell
am i hanging around here for 
yeah  i know  sorry 
nice shot  aaron 
brick  that is ugly  aaron 
we could have used that
last week against ti 
at least you ve got your golf game 
i see you ve been practicing 
you come out here with your  3 tie
and think you can play whiteball 
what are you doing tonight 
i was supposed to be in raleigh 
thanks to you i missed my flight 
  you know robert 
  yeah 
he s got a birthday tonight 
why don t you come out 
  i m just going to hang out with my cousin 
  bring him  rachel will be there 
  big reunion 
  exactly 
i don t think i m doing this 
why not 
because i can think of a million
different ways that this can happen   
and nobody comes anywhere near
getting hurt 
i can call her and see
if she wants to do something else   
or better yet 
not even talk to her about the party 
that s good fortonight  what about
tomorrow  and every other day 
  i ll take care of tomorrow  tomorrow 
  you ll watch her always 
this guy is crazy enough to walk
into a room of people waving a shotgun 
what do you think he ll do
if he ever finds her alone 
this way  we know exactly what happens 
we have complete control over it 
at the end of the night 
this guy is arrested and goes to jail 
that s the way it goes 
your words  not mine 
now come on  it has to be you 
she said she was there
because you told her you would be there 
don t tell me i came back
and did this for nothing 
he doesn t fire 
  no  he didn t fire 
  he never fires 
  not even when you rushed him 
  no  he didn t 
he didn t the time i was  when i rushed him 
and from what robert tells you 
he didn t do it tonight 
he doesn t have the nerve 
we know everything 
okay  we re prescient 
we can still be careful 
maybe we can get to the gun
without him knowing 
we definitely can 
he leaves it in the truck
before he goes in  we don t even need to   
  but if it makes you feel better  
  what s wrong with our hands 
what do you mean 
why can t we write like normal people 
i don t know  i can see the letters 
i know what they should look like 
i just can t get my hand to make them easily 
try comparing it to your left hand 
mine looks the same 
guess what today is 
no  no  it s your friend robert s birthday 
he says he likes records 
so i got him the best of bread 
no  real records  like vinyl 
i can tell you with certainty
what i did that night when it was my turn 
but i think it would do little good 
because what the world remembers   
the actuality 
the last revision is what counts  apparently 
so how many times did it take aaron   
as he cycled
through the same conversations   
lip synching trivia over and over 
how many times would it take
before he got it right 
three  four 
twenty 
i ve decided to believe
that only one more would have done it 
i can almost sleep at night
if there is only one more 
slowly and methodically 
he reverse engineered a perfect moment 
he took from his surroundings
what was needed   
and made of it something more 
and once the details had been
successfully navigated   
there would be nothing left to do
but wait for the conflict 
maybe the obligatory
last minute moral debate   
until the noise of the room
escalates into panic   
and background screams
as the gunman walks in 
and eventually he must have got it perfect
and it must have been beautiful   
with all the praise and adoration
he had coming 
he had probably saved lives  after all 
who knows what would have happened
if he hadn t been there 
i know that things are bad  okay 
i know that you don t agree
with what i ve done 
i know that you re upset 
and to be honest  i m not too happy
with you  either  right now 
but you know that this is going to pass 
let s just go 
let s go somewhere
where we don t speak the language 
aaron  we don t have the money back here   
and we d have to steal our own passports 
money  we ll make money 
they have sports betting in vegas 
march madness 
we ll make enough in one night
to finance a thousand vacations 
passports  you know
they re not using theirs  anyways 
now  come on  i m thinking star city 
check out the cosmonaut training grounds 
i m staying here 
why 
they ll be building their own boxes
in another day 
and yours already knows what they ve built 
you re not going to be able
to watch them forever 
the box abe is building won t work 
he s got it wired wrong 
and if they fix that   
i ll start actually taking pieces out of it 
it s just a gimmick 
it doesn t work anymore 
your double will say
they have to move on to something else 
and mine will agree  they re friends 
you re staying  why 
why  let s see  why would abe stay 
what possible reason could there be
to be here 
i guess that
it just won t go back far enough  will it 
tell you what  why don t you take kara
and lauren and put them in the box   
and then you and aaron can each keep a set
and you can stop feeding off it 
  don t come back 
  you can each keep a set and a hemisphere 
there hasn t been a reason
to show you what i m capable of   
but i m telling this you now  go out there 
do whatever the hell you want 
there s no way in the world i can stop you 
but don t come back here   
and don t come near them 
any of them 
now i have repaid any debt
i may have owed you 
you know all that i know 
my voice is the only proof
that you will have of the truth of any of this 
i might have written a letter
with my signature   
but my handwriting
is not what it used to be 
maybe you ve had the presence of mind
to record this 
that s your prerogative
