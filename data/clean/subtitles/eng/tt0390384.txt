and youre going to stay on the line
youre not going to interrupt
youre not going to speak for any reason
now some of this you know
im going to start at the top of the page
meticulous yes methodical educated
they were these things
nothing extreme like anyone they varied
there were days of mistakes
and laziness and infighting
and there were days good days
when by anyones judgment
they would have to be considered clever
no one would say
that what they were doing was complicated
it wouldnt even be considered new
except maybe in the geological sense
they took from their surroundings
what was needed
and made of it something more
we havent even set up an appointment
what order date did you put on this
the 28th why
i dont know yeah im putting 28th
have you thought any more
about what you want to put forward
not really
because i was
i mean i havent changed my mind
or anything
phillip and i were talking
and we think it could be good itd be fun
nobodys saying it wouldnt be fun
the time for jacking around with tesla coils
and ball lightning in the garage is over
maybe you should try it on your own
in your free time
my free time the free time
after the 50 hours a week at work
or after the 30 hours of free time
i already spend in that garage
and its not a tesla coil
i could save a few minutes a day
by eating on the toilet
how many patents do we have
in the last 14 months
did you sign the agreement
nobody signed the agreement
doesnt matter
were sticking to the agreement
name one thing out of that garage
thats remotely profitable
i dont see anybody quitting their jobs
because of it are you
abe just means that right now
the jtag cards are it
when you look at the addresses we have
a lot of apartments a lot of residences
but these are not the bulk orders
to the oems or retail giants
these are the quiet basement
hackers
yeah hacker wannabes
testing their dads old motherboards
and i know that a lot of that is my fault
admittedly you know
with everything last year and the doubletalk
we were getting from platts
and all the stuff we wont get into now
we should get into it
im sorry what
go ahead tell him
we should get into it
i talked to my brother today
he knows of two other cases like that
at his firm
let platts know that were talking about it
look forget platts
this has got to be about what
has the best chance of going to market
and what is going to get us vc attention
look i stuck by you guys
when it was your turn
and i wasnt 100 sure
of what we were doing
or even if i didnt agree maybe
but if its my turn
if were still playing by the rules
then this is what i want to try
here take it
they said it wouldnt hold a freeze
robert please its not going to hold
its going to go bad in my car
itll go bad here okay thanks
good night all
see you
we just got done giving this huge speech
we gave the speech
we just got done it was five minutes ago
im the one that forced the issue theyre
onto us because i suck as the bad cop
you should do it you could fake it better
i dont know about that
as long as were going down this road
where its eighth grade physics
and happy fun time out in that garage
i think we could stand to try this
phillip and robert are gung ho on theirs
and thats fine
but you know i have no interest in that
i know you have no interest
besides the fact
that phillip and robert dont even need us
they just want to use the equipment
for what i want to do we dont need them
not even phillip
because it doesnt need software
is she asleep
no and she needs a bath
shell wind up in the closet if i do it
thats fine
you know even if roberts okay with it
and he wont be
i dont understand what that thing will do
well let them go at it for two months
they do theirs we do ours
they said itd take 14 hours
dont eat that seriously its bad
we threw the first couple of batches out
the filter
what about crushed
these guys are funded
these guys are what
liquid helium these guys are funded
thats what this is
thats the whole difference
thats what the box is
we dont have to play the game
where were going back and forth
coming up with innovative ways to make it
colder and unusable in the process
aaron i need the hexagonal set
this is unmarketable
by coming at it from the back end
rather than changing
the surrounding temperature
well change the level itll conduct
the transition temperature
and by bombarding these edges
theyre dropping the ceramic
the temperature lower and lower
it makes the ceramic less resistant
and knocks out the interior magnetic field
what im saying is
we drop the box down on it
focus our own magnetic field to negate
knock out with the inverse
whats going on inside the ceramic
that should change the transition
temperature to something we can work with
what are we saying that is
hopefully near room temperature
what is that about
the best mathematician is a lazy one
what did you ask for
i asked i need the hexagonal set
what did you call it
just come on
are these type one
the superconductors
yeah theyre type one
is that going to be a problem
theres plenty lying around at work
but theyre all bar coded
lf i have to ill buy the kits
what are you doing about the source
what
i can get them
you can are you sure
i thought you didnt like this idea
buy them if you have to
everything else we can take care of
what about the source here
you know that story
about how nasa spent millions
developing this pen that writes in zerog
did you ever read that
and how russia solved the problem
yeah they used a pencil
right a normal wooden pencil
it just seems like phillip takes
the nasa route almost every time
palladium
youve got their diagram what does it say
they use a ratio of platinum and palladium
thats not necessary
with the changes i made
theyre just showing off
if you have it use it
i want to get a replacement router
im putting down four ounces of palladium
did robert look at it
i already got his
i cant fix it
okay where are you getting it
walmart its 50
okay can you get a receipt please
yeah
wait platinum or palladium
is less resistant
abe its not a
yeah i dont care
so resistance doesnt matter
i need an aye or a yes
did you jiggle the
the collet nut
robert did it
well yes i guess
well then which is cheaper
youre not going to buy it are you
well unless youve got
a few grams of palladium lying around
why would they put it in there
if you didnt need it
one catalytic converter its fine
remember to put it back
your emission just went up 300
is there enough in here
yeah should be
if not well pull the one out of my truck
okay coppertubing
this will be out of commission right
without the tubing
we can use the freon too
no its going to be room temperature
i know just in case
no wait stop ill just buy the tubing
this isnt saving us money
jay hey man how are you
good
should we be wearing goggles
should we be wearing goggles
what
goggles should we be wearing goggles
wait phillip you dont want
to come out here
phillip grab a mask okay
it is though right its not just me
no its definitely smaller but it just seems
that way take what they have
minus the coolant which we dont need
the rest of it is the mercury bath
which you would know better than i do
but theyre probably just showing off
i mean you have it you got to use it right
what does it hurt
no i didnt feel anything
that sound is just weirding me out
what does it feel like
i dont know
i dont know if im making it up
here
next part lets do the next part
yeah
isnt there some sort of glass
or a transparent
anything we can use as a window pyrex
yeah im in
okay drop it
i dont know of anything
that wont leave a gap in the field
but we got to see whats going on in there
how much did that cost
yeah
what
you want to put my camcorder
inside the box thats so dangerous
we cant look into it
if something happens
would you pay me back
so we have a slightly negative pressure
in the box
so were ready for the argon
which one is that
its the blue one
i weighed it at 77 grams
i set the scale to decagrams though
im showing 77 decagrams
ready for
005 liters of argon
you ready
just the plate first right
right first just the plate and then weii
lets just give it a second
you want to do the box now
yeah
lets go through the checklist
aaron hold on a second
lets make sure everythings set up right
hold on aaron wait
just wait
okay
anything
is this normal
i dont know
im turning it off
wait no
okay i didnt do that
did we blow something
yeah we did thats destroyed
you want to check your camera
yeah
lets get this
you ready
one two three
hey tell me youre hungry
karas at her moms and im starving
yeah im hungry what
abe its 700 abe its 700 at night
okay yeah i have food
okay
wait are those kids there
just a sec
yeah theyre here
okay screw that lets just go somewhere
i just pulled in so come on down
come up first i have some stuff
i want to take back to the shop
all right but meet me at the door
okay all right
seriously meet me at the door
okay all right see you
whats up abe
hey brad how are you
good
how long did he say he would be there
not long
if hes got problems hes got to fix them
youre not his dad
i know i just thought it would be good
to do something charitable
it definitely is charity
at least you admit that
you feel like a steak to eat
i dont want a steak lets just
grab some tacos on the way to the shop
i have some stuff i want to try out
okay
we can get some tacos on the way
or we can get a steak afterwards
what are you talking about
im not paying for a steak
its stable
aaron its stable
what did you do to this thing
what
it looks like a dog digested it
okay thats the plate
i rigged this into the box
so i could control the feed
i figured its the easiest way
its just controlling the box
the plate stays the same
what you do is you gradually feed it
okay you hear that how its
see im not touching it anymore
its growing with its own momentum
its like a feedback loop
and it just regulates itself
and what you do is when it gets there
you bring it back
and there you go it coasts
its stable it stays like that
so it works
yeah it does
what is that like 10
it knocks another couple of points
by the time it reaches the peak
you may want to come over here
and take a look at this
okay what am i looking at
what are we pulling out of the batteries
probably 24 volts
i mean no more than that right
okay
so your meters jacked up
thats what i figured so i tried three others
i got the exact same thing
i spent all last night
what was it
i spent last night and a twohour break
just doublechecking everything
theres something wrong here were not
pulling out more than were putting in
slightly more
well yeah whatever
its not like a volt and a half
more than were putting in
its probably the batteries
theyre cheap batteries not regulated right
that is weird though
you want to see something weirder
okay lets go over this again
two batteries right 24 volts
what are we pulling out of this one
just for fun
twelve volts
how about this one
should be 12 volts
so what the hell is this thing
it doesnt stay like that
no it winds down in a few minutes
what does that
i dont know ill tell them something
ill tell them were spraying for bugs
it should just be a day or two anyways
unless you want to bring them in
no they have their work in there too
if phillip finds out about that
hes going to have to take it apart
no im just putting a little tweak on it
yeah i know no youre right
abe its my garage okay
its not like theyre paying rent
there was value in the thing
clearly of that they were certain of
but what is the application
in a matter of hours
they had pinned it to everything
from mass transit to satellite launching
imagining devices the size of jumbo jets
everything would be cheaper
it was practical and they knew it
but above all that beyond the positives
they knew that the easiest way
to be exploited
is to sell something
they did not yet understand
so they kept quiet
the parties would continue
any birthday anniversary holiday
maybe some obscure project launch
it didnt matter any reason would do
what was important is that thomas granger
their last best hope of funding show up
if he left a little earlier than
they wouldve liked he couldnt be blamed
he was only there
to please his daughter rachel
and she was only there to please abe
what did you say
to mr granger a while ago
did you flip my burger
you cant call him mr granger
you have to call him like
thomas or something
go ahead
no because he wont take you seriously
he thinks were kids
lf you call him mr granger
he looks at you like youre a 6yearold kid
he does it with me it wont work anymore
abe had taken on the task
of quantifying and explaining the device
but as weeks became months
their enthusiasm became a slow realization
that they were out of their depth
there he is
ive been calling you all morning
whered you call
your work and your cell
im not there
really
march madness
its carolina and michigan
whos up
i dont even know what
do you have anything important
at work today
i hope youre not implying
that any day is unimportant at cortex semi
i was going to come give you
this big speech about how weve been
friends for a long time and built up trust
that whole thing
but how about this instead
if you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things i ask you
i will in return show you
the most important thing
that any living organism has ever witnessed
well it looks like mustard to me
i know but its a film its a protein
secreted by a fungus
called aspergillus ticor
he told you that
no he knew it was a protein
but didnt know where it came from
all he really did was just take some pictures
with their equipment
guess where were going
do you know where will is
no why
the ariel meeting
is pushed back till wednesday
i thought he was waiting around for it
where are you going
what do they do with engineers
when they turn 40
what bradshaw
exactly you know what
i do know where will is
ill let him know on my way out
okay thanks
can you meet me out front
you got to drive
okay here take my keys
okay if you can just pretend
that this is the first time i came in
and if you would just
tell him exactly what you told me
okay so what is it
protein buildup
okay can you just tell him
protein buildup
but what kind
some fungus
some fungus
where did it come from
i dont know you were to take it to the lab
yeah thats next
you were in design werent you
yeah
how did you get over here
do you know what they do
with engineers when they turn 40
they take them out and shoot them
what the hell abe
you could have just shown me the pictures
i want you to believe it
believe what the protein
i believe you
okay look
this guy already thinks its a joke
so he may be a little defensive
really why would he think that
please
aspergillus ticor
this is a fungus thats everywhere
its in our bed our skin
sometimes even our gi tract everywhere
its basically the reason you dont leave
things in dark damp closedoff places
thank you
do you have that sample i brought
there it is terger terger
okay when i showed you this
tell him what you thought
you thought it was a joke right
it is a joke
right but how did you know
will you show him please
this is how i get protein a
out of aspergillus ticor we sweeten it
we agitate it we spin it around
we sweeten some more
takes about a month
to get the same amount i brought in
to get the same amount i brought in
so if its an incubator for fungus
is that valuable
thats not what it is
then what is it
theres another way to secrete
that much protein do it naturally
but that takes a lot longer
if it has a little moisture and its left alone
itll start secreting and itll build up
and build up but it takes a long time
how long
a long time
more than a few days then how long
to get the same amount of protein
that we have
the amount that i was wiping off
every five days
and five days later it would accumulate
he says it would take about five to six years
i dont want to belittle this guy
so i said screw it
and i put my watch in there
and
i want you to do it
where is it the box
i took it back to the shop
wait digital or old mechanical
exactly i did both
and what
i want you to do it
we thought
that we were degrading gravity right
that we were blocking that information
i think were doing more than that
i think were blocking more than that
when you were controlling the feed
did you notice it was parabolic
its important parabolas are important
here look at this
i dont know abe
im going to start it up
and let it run for 60 seconds
with nothing in it its empty this time
thats 22
in all the equations that describe motion
and heat and entropy
in all feynman diagrams whats the
one variable that you can turn negative
and still get rational answers for
its not mass
twentytwo hours 27 minutes in the box
its an odd number
thats 1347 minutes
1347 man you got that fast
how did you know its odd
because this is it this is whats going on
theres an a end and a b end
lets say the a end is 1200and the b end is 1201
all right we start the machine
with the weeble at the a end
it travels forward
you got to write this down
theres nothing to write down
ill write it down
it travels forward normally
towards the b end
when it gets there
the feed runs down parabolically
until it should stop but it curves
back around towards the a end
when it gets back to the a end
curve that around the weeble
has experienced a total of two minutes
and again it curves
back around it curves parabolically
right
it comes back around
and it does this about 1300 times
when it finally exits on the b end
its traveled an odd number
of forward and backward trips
what is so special about 1300
why is it about 1300 why isnt it exact
this is not empirical
here give me that
i dont know why its not exact
theres some sort of probability there
every time it hits the b end
theres a chance
a small chance it wont
curve back around towards the a end
and for some reason it takes
about 1300 trips before it finally does
it does have to exit or else
we wouldnt be able to see it afterwards
okay lets take a look at this
twentytwo hours 14 minutes
1334 minutes
even
enter at the b end
exit at the b end
i just want you to see it the way i saw it
i am trying okay
everything were putting in that box
comes ungrounded
and i dont mean grounded to the earth
i mean not tethered
were blocking whatever keeps it
moving forward so they flipflop
inside the box its like a street
and both ends are culdesacs
this isnt frame dragging or wormhole
matching its basic mechanics and heat
this is not mechanics and heat
we can publish
yeah we can publish
no i mean we can really publish
aaron the weebles stupid it cant move
even if we were
to put the weeble in at point b
its still going to bounce back and forth
until its kicked out at the b end
but if it were smart
it could enter at the b end
and exit at the a end before it flips back
youre talking about making a bigger one
i didnt say anything
youre the one talking about it
so you believe me
no i dont
come on lets go get a drink or something
were going to have to move it
we will
we need a box big enough for a person
to fit into as far as turning it on
i was testing the box it turns out
over half the rings are redundant
the inner ring is strong enough on its own
so it makes the plate smaller
a lot more is unnecessary
what we can do
is take a lot of these small plates and
surround a container with a web of them
how small
it should be accumulative so a lot of
minifields equal one big one right
yeah sum of series that makes sense
what i was going to say is we need
to find a place where we can put it
and turn it on and it wont be disturbed
we could just lock it in a closet
someplace where someones not going to
go poking around and messing with it
and climatecontrolled
yeah so whatever well find some place
so if we go your route with what
a bunch of minifields
thats a lot of work wed have to
i mean how many days is that
abe you know what we could use
i know weve seen
a lot of crazy things lately okay
i know youre still trying to put
it all together in a way that makes sense
look i just want you to understand
that whats next is not a prank okay
i wouldnt do that to you
and im not doing that to you
so when you see this you cant yell
or make any noise or run anywhere
i know you probably feel like youre
being tricked or made fun of but youre not
i promise you youre not okay
who was that abe
lets just wait six minutes
look you sure youre okay to drive
what did you do all day
the first time through
i spent the day in a hotel room
in russellfield
ill just meet you back at the shop
i wonder what i did
i guess i went back to work
yeah probably
probably just worked i guess
yeah probably so
look now that i know about this abe
dont do this again okay
not where it affects me
go ahead
hey rachel
why not the lottery
we can if you want
but its not until saturday
and even if we win the full 10 million
thats only 200000 for the next 30 years
and thats just one good trade
a couple days like this
i was just running a test in and out
i want to do what you did
exactly what you did
the first thing i did is call in sick
okay i did that
then i drove to the storage facility
but i need to drop lauren at school first
then meet me there
were going to need both cars
we need to park yours down the road
out of sight of the facility
why are we doing that
because we need a ride home
what is that
itll make sense
okay ill be patient
when i got to the storage room
i flooded the box with argon
and i had to tighten it up
to secure the leaks
theres leaks
theres always leaks
at 830 am i set the timer for 15 minutes
i jumped in the car
and drove to russellfield
okay i lost it
what
why the timer
because the moment we start those
machines is the moment well end up
getting out of them and
right got it sorry
i dont want to be standing around
when they do
while i was on the road at 845
the machine kicked on by itself
and by 849 it was completely warmed up
in russellfield i got a hotel room
and tried to isolate myself
wait what do you mean isolate
i closed the windows
i unplugged everything in the room
the telephone tv clock radio everything
i didnt want to take the chance
of running into someone i knew
or seeing something on the news
that might
if were dealing with causality
and i dont even know for sure
i just
what
took myself out of the equation
err on the side of caution
yes
then what did you do all day
i just sat there i had some books but
what were you nervous
yeah
its mindnumbing all the secondguessing
evacipate
at 330 pm
i stopped by williams medical supply
picked up a class e oxygen tank and mask
i called my mutual fund company and asked
which stock in their midcap fund
had the greatest percentage gain that day
the idea was just to get enough information
for one good trade
can we just download chart data
and trade on each movement
but if we do that i want to use the library
in russellfield use their computers
so i got to the storage room at about 315
and cut off the power to the box
it cycled down to a tolerable level
at about 319
the trick is to get in
after it reaches a comfortable level
but before it shuts off completely
theres a window there
so does it hurt
yeah it does a little
its not bad if you wait for the right time
its like a small static shock
once youre in youre fine though
what
i know youve done it
and i can only assume that you dont have
cancer or male impotence
but what is your opinion
on how safe this thing is
i can imagine no way
in which this thing would be
considered anywhere remotely close to safe
all i know is i spent six hours in there
and im still alive
you still want to do it
i set the alarm on my stopwatch
for six hours
i regulated the o2 tank
took some dramamine and tried to sleep
did you
what
did you sleep
not at first ive never
considered myself claustrophobic
but i started sweating and i couldnt find
the right flow rate on the tank
and i was breathing differently than i was
when i was testing it on the outside
eventually i settled down and
i dont know maybe it was the dramamine
kicking in but i remember this moment
in the dark
with the reverberation of the machine
it was maybe the most content
ive ever been
i woke up on my own without the alarm
and waited for the machine to cool down
cool down from my perspective
it got to a point where it sounded safe
to get out
but the stopwatch still showed
a couple minutes
so i trusted the math and waited
thats not a static shock abe
okay please stop it
you got out too soon
you have to wait for the stopwatch
so that you know the gain is low enough
so were back here
yeah were here
its 850 tuesday morning
all right give me a few minutes
from there it was easy
the bulk of the work was done
i just left everything the way i found it
i left the machine alone
and didnt turn it off
and just cleared out of there
so your double would find everything
the same later that day and get in the box
right but also i or my double or someone
was in the box coming backwards
so who knows what that wouldve done
if id turned the machine off
definitely so theyre onetime use only
so then at that moment since my double
was on the way to the hotel in my car
i had to take a taxi home but when we go
well be able to use your truck
you have a margin account right
yeah i do now what are we buying
good today before 1230 well buy
as many shares as we can of rgwu
theyll say their earnings that quarter
are three and a half times consensus
and the stock will nearly double
in afternoon trading
what do they do
what do you mean
what does this company do
do they make things or
i dont know
all that matters is the price goes up
the volume is so high that the number
of shares we trade wont affect the price
you really dont know what they do
thats why you spoke about a midcap fund
so volume is high enough to hide us
do you think its too cautious
i dont know
i know theres a lot of other stocks
out there
that do a lot more than double
but this is my first day
my god
shes not going to answer
i know abe thats the question
i know so whats the answer
youve got the 400 billion
youve gone the charity route
you have this perfect 100room mansion
with matching his and her yachts
and helicopter pads
basically you have absolute impunity
to do whatever you want
nobody can touch you
youre back from a twoyear
above the law
absolutely well above youre fresh back
from this twoyear worldgalloping vacation
how do you fill your day what do you do
abe i know thats the question but its not
a real question so why does it matter
so whats the answer
babe he knows thats the question okay
hes asking you the question
what do you mean what would i do
with my life or what would i do tomorrow
my god either
id have to do something constructive
id have to do something that would help
something that would make me feel good
i know thats fantastic good
my wife so good so pure you are pure
shut up why did you ask then
this is what i would do
i would wake up tomorrow morning
and id go over to gabriel capital inc
and i would tell joseph platts receptionist
that im there to see him
and when he comes out
i would ram my fist
through the flat of his nose
just one good punch one good pow
thats amazing its about time
that is so great
where did this come from
youre always defending the guy
its unnatural
id only do it if i knew that
no one would find out or get hurt
like i wish that there was a way
that i could do it
and then i go back and tell myself not to
because i just want to know
what it feels like thats all really
im so proud
finally my husband the hero
we cant do that
i know
did you call pest control
babe theyre birds you dont want a bunch
of dead baby birds up there do you
they dont sound like birds
she thinks there are rats in the attic
but the idea had been spoken
and the words wouldnt go back
after they had been uttered aloud
so you are understanding this right
you dont have to sell me
on not doing this okay
i dont think i told you
even if you do stop yourself
your double from hitting platts
why would he your double get in the box
and with no need for it
no possible realworld application
no advantage at all to be gained from it
the idea stayed
how would you do it
i wouldnt
just for fun
i still wouldnt
but what if there was a way to
look abe look
im not going to pretend
like i know anything about paradoxes
or what follows them and honestly
i really dont believe in that crap
kill your mom before you were born
whatever it has to work itself out somehow
i dont know
this is what i know for sure
the worst thing in the world is to know
that the moment you are experiencing
has already been defined
that this is the second
or third time through or whatever
and do you everfeel like
i dont know maybe things arent right
like maybe your life is in disarray
or just not what you would like
and you start to wonder what caused this
people are always blaming their parents
as if if their mom had breastfed them
their lives would be different
bunch of whiners
yeah they are but what if it wasnt
something you wonder about
what if you knew this is not the way
things are supposed to be
im not like that im not into the whole
destiny theresonlyonerightway thing
im not either but whats worse
thinking youre being paranoid
or knowing you should be
you dont have to look at me like that
im okay
no i just assumed that you would
i trust her
i know that when i decided to tell you
decided to tell
i knew that you are married and that theres
no secrets anything i tell you shell know
its not a matter of trust
i know
its just how much better will it be
if in a few days
i surprise her and we all just fly
to costa rica or somewhere for a month
well let her understand it gradually
maybe do some real estate shopping
for now you can tell her
you had a good day in the market
you dont understand
no
you dont understand the questions
that come with that
but well explain it to her
and well take some time
to figure out whats next
which i think should be building
a bigger box like the size of a room
where more than one person could fit in
safe or not
the thing feels like a coffin the way it is
by the way this is our guy
whats the volume
fiveandahalf
whats the return holy
no i cant beat that but mainly i guess
i was just talking about robert and phillip
i dont want to tell them
i know they have a lot invested
in the group
i dont want to tell them
if you need me to take the guilt on this one
fine okay
i accept it gladly its mine
at the end of this week
they can have whatever they want
ill turn over patent rights on everything
from the last two years
they can have the equipment
the garage the house
they can have my truck
if that makes you feel better
but i am not telling them a thing
about this were not
god everything is so different in there
you can feel how cut off you are
its this entirely separate world
and you encompass most of it
and the sound
isnt the sound different on the inside
its like its singing
i guess you cant hear it on the outside
i had this dream in there
about what
i was on or near the ocean
and i just kept hearing the surf
it was so uneventful
at night
and the tide kept coming in and out
come here for a second man
whats on your hand
are you bleeding
that is blood
turn around
you see it
where is it coming from its your notebook
its you my gosh its on your ear
what is this
your ears bleeding man
give me that i got it
is that normal this isnt normal
for the machine
for people
you think its the machine i got it
great i can actually
get some work done today
hi guys whats going on
i always seem to get a lot more done
when im not locked out
he says they had to spray again
but he cant tell us about it in advance
is hero even here
you never see anything around here
but those geckos
i know
i think its for the geckos
what
why
hey man thanks for the present
how is that working out for you
you know what you guys both of you
you make fun but there is a difference
wait what did you call him
what
when you walked in what did you say
he didnt tell you about it
no
all right rachels exboyfriend
walks into my birthday party with a shotgun
what
swear to god
ive already gotten that speech from kara
filby
youll get it you have a wife and kid
its funny how you two are the only people
that have a problem with it
everybody else thinks i did a good thing
you didnt
you cant risk your life and
especially the welfare of kara and lauren
for someone like rachel
she practically begs
for this to happen to her
i figured at least youd understand
understand what
youve never been like this
thats what i mean
you see how different things are now
different how are things different
you see it okay i know you do
look that was the night
you had told me everything
about the machine
everything you showed me was so fresh
in my head and when i saw this guy
im looking at him
i wasnt going to let him do that
i wasnt going
to let him scare people like that
i know it was stupid okay
but i mean this whole idea
this whole thing that were doing
it just took some getting used to for me
i wasnt completely acclimated to it
if it was just you you had to worry about
id still think youre stupid
but you have a family now
and god especially now
anything like this would be crazy
i know okay
i know you know that but youve got to
i know okay
filby
you little sack of
even if you see him dont tell me
its not my fault if i dont know
and i just hope the thing runs away
then what are we doing out here
she worries about the cat
so you look for the cat its what you do
i dont know
what do you mean
its embarrassing that the storage room guy
sees us come in together
but he never sees us leave
yeah but what do you think
the receptionist thinks
about two guys that come
and get a room for six hours every day
did you unplug this
you brought your cell phone
can i check the caller id
yeah were not back
yeah but you cant take it back
with you okay
this is aaron hey babe
im not there i had to come downtown
and hold some of these guys hands
tell me
that sounds good
no ive got to eat with these offsite fags
save mine though ill have it later
okay yeah 600
what
what
were supposed to win this by two
they just turned over with 12 on the clock
we have to foul
no
what no we foul here
they miss the first free throw
and they come back with the three
three points
thats right
man are you hungry
i havent eaten since later this afternoon
whats up you guys
you have got to be kidding
im sorry i forgot it was in my pocket
its kara
yeah
how do cell phones work
if theres two duplicate phones
and i call the same number
do they both ring at the same time
or is there
thats not how they work
its a radio signal
no its a network
it checks each area and
when it finds the phone it stops ringing
it rings the first one
this one is ringing
right
so the one your double has in russellfield
cant be
right i think we broke symmetry
are you sure thats how cell phones work
no
you feel all right
i feel fine do you
yeah
is kara asleep did i wake you up
yeah no not me it felt more like a nap
i think my bodys getting used to
these 36hour days whats going on
we can do this but we have to do it now
do you have his home address
why now
we were planning on taking a trip
tomorrow right just like today
yeah for stocks
okay well half an hour ago i was asleep
this car alarm woke me up
these kids were down skating by
hitting cars on the block
so we go right now do our business
at platts get back in the box
and come back before
those kids set off those alarms
all we really have to do is stand there
in plain sight that should scare them off
that way my double
sleeps through the night
they dont have this conversation
and they get in the box tomorrow as usual
theyll be changed but
yeah but at least theyll get in the box
wait how do we go back that far
if the machines havent been running
have they been running
yeah
i started going by at 500and turning them on 500 pm
i got tired of the whole
unanswerable question
are we doing this as an experiment
or are we doing this for me
a little of both
500
if we get this done by 300
thats 10 hours in the box
ive got the o2 tanks in the car
is that
is that rachels car
no thats not rachels thats her dads
they have the same kind
did you see that
thats mr granger thats thomas
hes sitting in that car
what
i swear that was him
what the hell is he doing
sitting outside my house
at 200 in the morning
i dont believe this
what is he following us
what are you doing
lets just see what he wants
no lets just get out
of my neighborhood first come on
did you see him today
no
i did i saw him this afternoon
around 600
are you sure you didnt see him
when we drove past
no what
im positive this afternoon
he was cleanshaven i know he was
he was ready to go to some function
with his wife
he looks like hes got
a two or threeday growth now
are you sure
no im not sure but i think so
rachel this is abe did i wake you up
can i get your dads number
from you real quick
yeah okay go ahead
yeah thanks
whats he doing
hes just sitting there
he got out for a second
and i thought he was coming over
and then he got back in the car
i think hes drunk
hi sorry to call so late
may i speak to thomas granger please
yeah this is james miller
from putney and myers
hi mr granger
thomas granger
what are you doing here come here
what happened
im okay i slipped
i want to know what box he used
you built one for you right just one
yeah how many do you think i made
these are set right i turned them on at 500
he could have used one
and gone back to 500
he could be in one of them right now
i say we shut them off
and see if hes in there
were you planning on talking to him
just tell me if you were
im not going to be mad
no i promise you you know i wouldnt
are you sure you wouldnt
youre the one he cant get near
without passing out
there is no way
i would tell anyone about this no way
can you think of any reason you might
no
sometimes we do things
but dont know how we got to that point
no i cant
cant what
i cant think of any reason why i would
well i cant either
what if it was an emergency
so youd do it if it was an emergency
no i dont know what so you might then
i dont know what kind of emergency
the permutations were endless
they tried again going to the source
but even while keeping him separated
from abe by two rooms
ask him his name
grangers condition
could only be described as vegetative
what did he say
from this they deduced
that the problem was recursive
but beyond that found themselves
admitting against their own nature
and once again
that the answer was unknowable
what do you think he changed
not much
we didnt have any contact with him
in the 3 hours he couldve done anything
i know he changed this i know we werent
having this conversation the first time
so you dont know what we lost
it really could not have been much
it doesnt matter how much
it just matters that its changed
i know what youre saying
the question should have been
what to do with the comatose man
in the guest bedroom
but in abes mind
he was already compiling the list
two mg of oral triazolam
every seven hours induces a safe sleep state
and a minimal metabolic rate
at this continued state of rest
the human body breathes
03 liters of oxygen a minute
or roughly 2000 liters in four days
a class e oxygen tank holds 625 liters
to maintain hydration
the body cycles through a minimum
of twoandahalf liters of water per day
any food would be a luxury
but the small tank
of medical grade nitrous oxide
would be needed on the other side
past the room that contained their machines
and up two levels
he made his way to another room
where he had stored what i will refer to
from here on as the failsafe machine
there he is
ive been calling you all morning
really
your cell and work
im not there
really
i dont even know what
im just tired
i hope youre not implying
that any day is unimportant at cortex semi
i was going to come give you
this big speech about how weve been
friends for a long time and built up trust
that whole thing
but how about this instead
if you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things i ask you
i will in return show you
the most important thing
that any living organism has ever witnessed
at this point
there would have been some discussion
abe would of course want to know how
aaron would have to explain
all about the storage manifest
and how it showed two rooms
under the name abram terger
then abe would need to know how
aaron would explain
that when he went up there
and found the failsafe running
he knew exactly what it was
but abe would ask how
and then the bit
about the modular design of the coffins
and how it meant he could fold one up
and take it back inside another
they are not onetime use only
they are recyclable aaron would say
how abe would ask
and aaron would describe
how simple things become
when you know precisely
what someone will have for breakfast
even in a world of tamperproof lids
how
and thats where
i would have entered the story
or exited depending on your reference
because when aaron came back
the second time it wasnt so easy
he wasnt expecting me to put up a fight
and by that time
he was too exhausted to take me
but for reasons
that are only evident to me now
i understood that he simply wanted it more
that he just had more invested so i left
he had already performed the task
as i had intended to
of recording the conversations of the day
just in case
through that earpiece
he had a threesecond lead on the world
aaron you need some sleep
some real sleep
i cant ive got a schedule
he had but to speak aloud the words
that came into his head
and those around him would fall in line
this is track 3
abe is bringing my car around
and i am on my way to the court
ill see will there
ill invite him to the party and make sure
hes bringing rachels boyfriend
will
you pretentious prick
what the hell is that
is that your cell phone
no its a radio man
you look like secret service
you look like secret service
ariel meeting is moved to wednesday
what what the hell
am i hanging around here for
yeah i know sorry
nice shot aaron
brick that is ugly aaron
we could have used that
last week against ti
at least youve got your golf game
i see youve been practicing
you come out here with your 3 tie
and think you can play whiteball
what are you doing tonight
i was supposed to be in raleigh
thanks to you i missed my flight
you know robert
yeah
hes got a birthday tonight
why dont you come out
im just going to hang out with my cousin
bring him rachel will be there
big reunion
exactly
i dont think im doing this
why not
because i can think of a million
different ways that this can happen
and nobody comes anywhere near
getting hurt
i can call her and see
if she wants to do something else
or better yet
not even talk to her about the party
thats good fortonight what about
tomorrow and every other day
ill take care of tomorrow tomorrow
youll watch her always
this guy is crazy enough to walk
into a room of people waving a shotgun
what do you think hell do
if he ever finds her alone
this way we know exactly what happens
we have complete control over it
at the end of the night
this guy is arrested and goes to jail
thats the way it goes
your words not mine
now come on it has to be you
she said she was there
because you told her you would be there
dont tell me i came back
and did this for nothing
he doesnt fire
no he didnt fire
he never fires
not even when you rushed him
no he didnt
he didnt the time i was when i rushed him
and from what robert tells you
he didnt do it tonight
he doesnt have the nerve
we know everything
okay were prescient
we can still be careful
maybe we can get to the gun
without him knowing
we definitely can
he leaves it in the truck
before he goes in we dont even need to
but if it makes you feel better
whats wrong with our hands
what do you mean
why cant we write like normal people
i dont know i can see the letters
i know what they should look like
i just cant get my hand to make them easily
try comparing it to your left hand
mine looks the same
guess what today is
no no its your friend roberts birthday
he says he likes records
so i got him the best of bread
no real records like vinyl
i can tell you with certainty
what i did that night when it was my turn
but i think it would do little good
because what the world remembers
the actuality
the last revision is what counts apparently
so how many times did it take aaron
as he cycled
through the same conversations
lipsynching trivia over and over
how many times would it take
before he got it right
three four
twenty
ive decided to believe
that only one more would have done it
i can almost sleep at night
if there is only one more
slowly and methodically
he reverseengineered a perfect moment
he took from his surroundings
what was needed
and made of it something more
and once the details had been
successfully navigated
there would be nothing left to do
but wait for the conflict
maybe the obligatory
lastminute moral debate
until the noise of the room
escalates into panic
and background screams
as the gunman walks in
and eventually he must have got it perfect
and it must have been beautiful
with all the praise and adoration
he had coming
he had probably saved lives after all
who knows what would have happened
if he hadnt been there
i know that things are bad okay
i know that you dont agree
with what ive done
i know that youre upset
and to be honest im not too happy
with you either right now
but you know that this is going to pass
lets just go
lets go somewhere
where we dont speak the language
aaron we dont have the money back here
and wed have to steal our own passports
money well make money
they have sports betting in vegas
march madness
well make enough in one night
to finance a thousand vacations
passports you know
theyre not using theirs anyways
now come on im thinking star city
check out the cosmonaut training grounds
im staying here
why
theyll be building their own boxes
in another day
and yours already knows what theyve built
youre not going to be able
to watch them forever
the box abe is building wont work
hes got it wired wrong
and if they fix that
ill start actually taking pieces out of it
its just a gimmick
it doesnt work anymore
your double will say
they have to move on to something else
and mine will agree theyre friends
youre staying why
why lets see why would abe stay
what possible reason could there be
to be here
i guess that
it just wont go back far enough will it
tell you what why dont you take kara
and lauren and put them in the box
and then you and aaron can each keep a set
and you can stop feeding off it
dont come back
you can each keep a set and a hemisphere
there hasnt been a reason
to show you what im capable of
but im telling this you now go out there
do whatever the hell you want
theres no way in the world i can stop you
but dont come back here
and dont come near them
any of them
now i have repaid any debt
i may have owed you
you know all that i know
my voice is the only proof
that you will have of the truth of any of this
i might have written a letter
with my signature
but my handwriting
is not what it used to be
maybe youve had the presence of mind
to record this
thats your prerogative
