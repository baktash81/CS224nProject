ill be the one
that makes her smile
her parents say
that im no good
i dont come
from her neighborhood
ohh
before too long
theyll see though
just what
she sees in me
but when
she holds my hand
i think
she understands

a little while
ill be the one
that makes her smile
but when
she holds my hand
i think
she understands

she knows
all my hopes and dreams
she knows
she knows
she knows
she means
everything to me
