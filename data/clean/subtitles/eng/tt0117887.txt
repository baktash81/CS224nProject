that thing you do
when we re apart
i find it very hard
to smile
you know that
other giris
have never been
my style
well  there s a feeling
that i get
when i m near you
i need you
that thing you do
i could search
around the worid
only to find
the only thing i need
is you right by my side
there s a feeling
that i get
when i m with you

i could search
around the worid

that makes her smile
her parents say
that i m no good
i don t come
from her neighborhood
ohh
before too long

a little while
i ll be the one
that makes her smile
but when
she holds my hand
i think
she understands
she knows it
she knows
she knows
she knows
she knows
all my hopes and dreams
she knows
she knows
she knows
she means
everything to me

a little time
one day i m gonna
make her mine
