in the seventh year of the reign
of augustus caesar
an imperial decree
ordered every judean
each to return
to his place of birth
to be counted and taxed
converging ways of many of them led
to their capital city jerusalem
the troubled heart of their land
the old city was dominated
by the fortress of antonia
the seat of roman power
and by the great golden temple
the outward sign of
an inward and imperishable faith
even while they obeyed
the will of caesar
the people clung proudly
to their ancient heritage
always remembering
the promise of their prophets
that one day there would be
born among them a redeemer
to bring them salvation
and perfect freedom
youll be counted at hebron
name
samuel
what city
joppa
what family
michael
move on move on
yes
name
joseph
what city
nazareth
what family
david of bethlehem
and the woman
my wife

youll be counted at bethlehem
come on come on
what village is this
nazareth
we should arrive in jerusalem
tomorrow night
youre not watching
the soldiers joseph
weve seen romans before
yes
and we will see them again
my table is not finished
where is your son
hes walking in the hills
he neglects his work joseph
no
once i reproached him with
forgetting his work he said to me
i must be about my fathers business
then why isnt he here working
hes working
trumpeters of the legion
welcome messala
the command is yours
thank you
thank you for relieving me
drusus
when i was a boy i dreamed
of commanding this garrison
now the wheel has turned
i am in command
attention
aisle one face right
forward
id forgotten the heat
if it were only the heat
i lived here until i was 14
jerusalem was my home
my father was head of
yes i know
your father is wellremembered
fine governor
if there can be such a thing
in this forsaken land
if you want to rise sextus
do the difficult
i asked to be sent here
youll find the people changed
since you were a boy
in what way
oh wont pay their taxes
an irrational resentment of rome
theres nothing new in all that
and then theres religion i tell
you theyre drunk with religion
they smash the statues of our gods
even those of the emperor
punish them
we do
when we can find them
find the leaders
you dont know theres nothing
you can put your finger on
there are strange forces
at work here
this messiah business
i know there was one
predicted when i was a boy
a king of the jews who will lead them
into some sort of antiroman paradise
makes your head spin
theres a wild man
in the desert named john
who drowns people in water
and a carpenters son who does magic
tricks miracles they call them
theres always a rabblerouser
stirring up trouble
no no no this man is different
he teaches that god is near
in every man
its actually quite profound
some of it
youve been too long away from rome
go back sextus
go to capri
bathe rest lie by the sea
and forget that
god is in every man
there is divinity in only one man
yes i know
the emperor is displeased
he wishes judea made into a more
obedient and disciplined province
hes ordered me to restore order
i shall carry out his wishes
how you can break a mans skull
arrest him throw him into a dungeon
but how do you control this
how do you fight an idea
especially a new idea
theres a jew outside
he wants to see the tribune messala
i assume he has a name
he says hes a prince judah benhur
then treat him like one
tell him i will join him
yes tribune
centurion
this was his country
before it was ours
dont forget that
yes tribune
very wise this benhur is
the richest man in jerusalem
and the head of one
of the greatest families in judea
we were friends as boys
we were like brothers
sextus
you ask how to fight an idea
well ill tell you how
with another idea
i said id come back
i never thought you would
im so glad
look at you
look at you
youve come back a tribune
when i heard that news
i drank a toast to you
well drink another now
your sister and mother
theyre fine
theyve talked of you
ever since we knew you were coming
is tirzah married
no
suitors come and go but she dreams
shes been in love with you
since she was 5
i cant wait to see them
do you still hunt jackals and lions
or have you become too dignified
down eros up mars
down eros up mars
where the beams cross
good
after all these years
still close
in every way
i hope so
i know
youre a roman and im a jew
whose life you once saved
the best thing i ever did
judah
it will be very difficult
to govern here
im going to need help
your help your advice
you want my advice
yes i do
withdraw your legions
give us our freedom
unfortunately the emperor
is devoted to his empire
hes particularly fond of judea
and judeas not fond of the emperor
is there anything so sad
as unrequited love
my quarters
a bit grim
not grim
austere virtuous
roman
im going to be secondincommand
to the new governor valerius gratus
hes coming in a few days
with more legions
then the rumors are true
the emperor does not approve
of your countrymen
there is rebellion in the wind
it will be crushed
but you and your family
need have no concern
im next in authority to the governor
and youre my friend
im a jew
ah you are like a roman
what have you in common
with the troublemaking rabble
theyre my people im one of them
be wise judah
its a roman world if you want to
live in it you must become part of it
youve changed
ive grown up ive seen the world
since i left jerusalem
ive seen rome its no accident
that one small village on the tiber
was chosen to rule the world
your legions
it wasnt just our legions
other countries have armies
fine armies i know i fought them
oh no
no it was fate that chose us
to civilize the world and we have
our roads and ships connect
every corner of the earth
roman law architecture literature
are the glory of the human race
i believe in the future of my people
of course you do
and you can help them
how
youre an aristocrat
your familys name is honored
youre a prince to your people
youre rich and powerful
your reputation is stainless
theyd listen if you
spoke out against rebellion
persuade your people that
their resistance to rome is stupid
it is worse than stupid futile
for it can end in only one way
extinction for your people
im against violence
everyone knows this
ive spoken against it
i shall do so again
then were agreed
now when can i come
to see your family
we had hoped tomorrow
good
and now for our toast
its dreadful wine by the way
its especially fermented
for the roman army
youre very cruel to your conquerors
its an insane world
but in it there is one sanity
the loyalty of old friends
judah we must believe in one another
will you drink to that
with all my heart
here it is the place ive remembered
the court where we played
at changing the guard
the roof where wed throw pebbles
at people in the street and then hide
we were rascals werent we
no you were good boys
i would have that time again
and here it is nothing has changed
except for the fountain
the old well would go dry remember
promptly every summer
a new fountain and a new tirzah
youve grown up
he hasnt changed has he mother
no
of course he has he was a boy
when he left us now hes a man
with great responsibilities
come
the emperor builds and builds
turning brick to marble
oh i almost forgot
i brought you this
ive never seen anything
like this before its beautiful
is it roman
its libyan i was there last year
a tremendous campaign
our armies met on the coast
after two days of fighting they fled
we marched on their capital
barbaric city but fascinating
or was till we destroyed it
now its nothing but ashes
im boring you with soldier stories
come with me theres something
i want to show you
thank you for this
i chose the right present for you
its a brooch for a woman
what do you think of it
magnificent
its arabic
i think he has the look of the breed
ive raised him
let me try him sometime
whenever you like hes yours
do you mean youll give me this
oh judah
you are good its going
to be like old times i know it
judah tell me did you
think about what i said
yes talked to a number
of people already
spoken against violence
against incidents
most of the men agree with me
most not all
no not all
who does not agree
well the resentful the impatient
who are they
yes judah who are they
would i retain your friendship
if i became an informer
telling the names of criminals
is not informing
theyre not criminals messala
theyre patriots
patriots
let me explain something to you
something you may not know
the emperor is watching us
at this moment he watches the east
this is my great opportunity
and yours too
if i bring order here
i can have any post i want
youll rise with me i promise
and do you know where it can end
rome yes perhaps at the side
of caesar himself
i mean it it can happen
and this is the moment
i swear this is the time
the emperor is watching us judging
us all i need do is serve him
and all you need do
is help me serve him
you speak as if he were god
he is god the only god
he is power
real power on earth not
not that
help me judah
i would do anything
for you messala
except betray my own people
in the name of all the gods what do
the lives of a few jews mean to you
if i cannot persuade them that does
not mean i would help you murder them
besides you must
understand this messala
i believe in the past
and future of my people
future you are a conquered people
you may conquer the land
you may slaughter the people
but that is not the end
we will rise again
you live on dead dreams
you live on the myths of the past
solomons glory is gone
you think it will return
joshua will not rise again
to save you nor david
there is only one reality in
the world today look to the west
dont be a fool look to rome
better a fool
than a traitor or a killer
i am a soldier
who kills for rome and rome is evil
i warn you
no i warn you
rome is an affront to god
rome is strangling my people
and my country the whole earth
but not forever
and i tell you the day rome falls
there will be a shout of freedom
such as the world
has never heard before
either you help me or you oppose me
you have no other choice
youre either for me or against me
if that is the choice
then i am against you
there they are
wheres messala
wheres
hes gone
gone
but why
he couldnt stay
what happened
a new tribune must have many duties
come let us have dinner
blessed art thou o lord our god
king of the world
who bringeth to us
bread from the earth
we shall never see him again tirzah
he wanted to use me
to betray our people
master the caravan from antioch
yes amrah i saw
simonides
oh welcome homecoming
master
simonides has brought gifts as usual
amber and jade for me
silk for tirzah
and for the master lberian wine

and what of numidia
the trade route is ours
guaranteed by treaty with the king

and once a year
i find myself wealthier
yeah but my greatest treasure
is my steward
my life belongs to the house of hur
nothing else exists for me
except my daughter
she must be a young woman by now
yes and your property
she was born
the daughter of your slave
when i inherited you
i inherited a friend not a slave
still esther has come with me from
antioch for your permission to marry
its granted i wish you
the joy of many grandchildren
if it is the lords will
i shall rejoice
with your permission
esther wishes to speak to her master
youre eager to marry esther
it is my fathers wish
your husband will be fortunate
what is his name
david son of mathias
of what house
his own master
he is a freeman
tell me more about him
i have seen him only once
he is a merchant
wellthoughtof in antioch

my wedding gift to esther
you are generous master

i will learn to love him
you have my permission to marry
well drink to your happiness
and a safe return to antioch
i disturbed you
no
what were you thinking
i was saying goodbye
to this city
and this house
youve not often been here
what do you remember of it
my father sometimes brought me here
when i was little
it was a house
where i was always happy
except once
when you and your friend
the roman boy
messala
yes
you had been out hunting
and they brought you home injured
i touched your face
as you lay there
and prayed to god
dont let this boy die
i can hear how you said it
gently as you say it now
yes master
master
why ive given you your freedom
its strange i hardly felt a slave
and now
i hardly feel free
you know in the old wise days
of solomon
if there was among his slaves
some girl who filled his eyes
he could choose her out
from the rest
and take her to him
wise days of solomon
different days
and long ago
if you were not a bride
i should kiss you goodbye
if i were not a bride
there would be no goodbyes
to be said
your slave ring
fair exchange
freedom to you the ring to me
you will wear it
until you meet the woman
you will marry
until then
the gods favor my lord gratus
if it is the governors pleasure
the wreath of office
thank you tribune
i see no delegation from the city
there will not be one sir

jerusalems welcome will not
be a warm one
but i pledge my lord
it will be a quiet one

is it possible
is it possible
you could do this to us
to people youve known
a family youve loved
you will let them go
you will gladly let them go
i didnt try to kill the governor
im not a murderer
i know youre not
you know
you are evil
no judah i am not evil
i wanted your help

by making this example of you
i discourage treason
by condemning without hesitation
an old friend i shall be feared

tribune im steward
of the house of hur
i remember you
we were on our way to antioch
when we heard what had happened
judah benhur could not have done
this thing you knew him tribune
better than you
then there must be no doubt in
your mind the charge is groundless
the prisoners have been sentenced
sentenced
but theres no truth in it
there was never a threat against
the governor in judahs mind
surely you must know
he would never have done this
in your heart you must know it
drusus
this man had better be kept here

your eyes are full of hate 41
thats good hate keeps a man alive
it gives him strength

the god of my fathers
your god has forsaken you
he has no more power
than the images i pray to
my gods will not help me
your god will not help you

does that interest you 41
i can see that it does
im a fighting man by profession
and in my leisure moments
it amuses me to train fighting men
i own some of the best gladiators
and charioteers in rome
would you like to become one of them
to die as your slave
better than to live in chains
below these decks
i will not be here forever
no
what would you do if you escaped
two people were condemned with me
my mother and sister
though they were innocent
i wont rest
do not say that you were innocent
would it do any good to say it again
no
consider my offer carefully you will
never escape while we are victorious
if we are not you will sink
with this ship chained to your oar
i cannot believe that
god has let me live these years
to die chained to an oar
its a strange stubborn faith
you keep
to believe that
existence has a purpose
a sane man would have learned
to lose it long before this
as you have
what drove it out of you
go back to your oar 41

welcome consul
we had given up all hope for you

the fleet all lost
five galleys
and the battle
the battle was won
you have a victory
it was a victory
complete
in his eagerness to save you
your god has also saved
the roman fleet
hail arrius
right oars
you have cleared the seaways
of a great danger quintus arrius
this baton of victory
has been nobly won
this man riding beside you who is he
the man who saved me divine emperor
to return and serve you
is that all you know about him
no he was accused of an attack
on the governor of judea
but he was innocent
if not theres a strange
inconsistency in this man
who tries to kill my governor
yet saves the life of my consul
come tomorrow well talk of it
we have all the information
on this man
a man of some influence
in his own country
his attack upon our governor is one
upon the senate and the people of rome
i am convinced that
no such attack was intended
consul allow us to continue
allow us to be generous
as a reward to you
for your great victory
we shall not send him back to
the galleys take him as your slave
such is the will of the senate
and the people of rome
not long ago i returned to rome
with a young man
who had saved my life
you all know him as
the finest charioteer in rome
five times hes driven
my horses to victory
i know him as one who stands
in the place of the son i lost
i have the love and pride
in a sons achievements
which i thought
i should never have again
nothing could make stronger
our bond
but tonight i wish
to share it with you all
the formalities of adoption
have been completed
young arrius is now
the legal bearer of my name
and the heir to my property
this ring of my ancestors
would have gone to my son
so now it is yours
its a strange destiny that
brought me to a new life
a new home
a new father
it brought me here
it may take me away
but wherever i may be
i shall always try to wear this ring
as a son of arrius should
with gratitude and affection
and with honor
my old friend pontius pilate
young arrius
before you came to this city
my horses always won
magnificent horses extremely swift
yes but not swift enough
to defeat you
tell me you come from judea
yes sir
i hear that the climate
is difficult to live in
not for judeans
its a terrible prospect
i am to be made governor
of judea
yes
i asked for alexandria
but it seems the wilderness
needs my particular talents
the scorpions and holy prophets
cant get on without me
lay the dust of judea
at least for this evening
goats and jehovah
youre leaving
i must
its a journey i cant keep you from
your eyes have never left it all
these months i can recognize pain
but still my counsel is to wait
gratus is to be replaced
the governorship goes
to pontius pilate
when
very soon
its very much to our purpose
nothing is to the purpose if when
i come back to judea i come too late
that is the thought which has punished
me every moment ive spent here
will rome see you again
here is a part of my life
which you have made for me
i shall remember it
whoever the gods are they take
small interest in an old mans hopes
they have their way
forgive me
youre a stranger here
would you be from nazareth
why do you ask
i thought
you might be the one
the one that i have come back
from my country to find
he would be about your age
who
when i find him
i shall know him
oh but forgive me
i am balthasar of alexandria
i am the guest of sheik llderim
sack of flesh without brains
no no not the whip
that is my host
gently gently
fool headless toad
you know nothing of horses
whip my children once and
ill drain every drop of your blood
now gently around the first turn
and let them run go on
keep my words in your head
let us see some wisdom
beautiful horses
now now they are ready
let them go
watch theyll never hold the turn
no no
abadon stop him
stop that whip
ill kill him ill kill
moonhead
give me those reins you fool
you think you can treat
my horses like animals
drive cows and goats
thats all youre fit for
get off idiot
drive goats not horses
i am doomed
you saw what happened here
this traveler told what would happen
before it happened
your horses are very fine
but theyre not a team
not a team
but one of them held steady
the one on the outside
antares
the slow one
he should run on the inside where
he can steady the others in the turns
you have a keen eye
where did you acquire it
in the circus in rome
you have driven in the great circus
tell me my friend could you
make my four run as one
im on my way to jerusalem
would your caravan rest until tomorrow
we have time enough
to eat drink and talk
come into my tent
and refresh yourself
and let me hear how you raced in rome
if i had a voice to sing
i would sing you the psalm of horses
no other animal has
descended so in scale
from the first innocent falling
of the world
and tomorrow i shall put antares
on the inside
when you do shorten the yoke
it will help them in the turns
judah benhur
youre a jew
yet you drove in the great circus
yes
by a strange choice
and a stranger fortune
your coming here was so fit so right
we might have achieved wonders
you have to go
i make a journey which will not wait
ah well then perhaps
you will come back
and when you do
bring your friends your wives
i have no wives
no wives at all
i have six no seven
ive counted eight
and that is because he is traveling
at home he has more
believe me it is a great advantage
to have many wives
someday i hope to have one
one wife
one god that i can understand
but one wife that is not civilized
it is not generous
was the food not to your liking
indeed
thank you thank you
and take my advice my friend
buy yourself some wives
and now i must say good night
to my beauties
when ready for sleep
they get impatient and jealous
they wait to see which one
i will embrace first
ill make my farewells then
no no no stay
stay and see them
come my children come
strangers make them shy
come
come do not be afraid come
there my children
they are descended from
the arabians of the pharaohs
and i have named them
for the stars
come antares
you are the slowest and you can
run all day without tiring
what yes yes
yes i love you too
theres my good antares
come rigel
weve both supped well
and the world is good
theres my good rigel
yes you are ready for sleep
the days work done for you eh
yes well you can go
to sleep in a minute
good night good night my treasure
steady aldebaran
i havent forgotten you
no you are the swiftest
but you must be steady
never seen finer horses even in rome
you should see their mother mira
i dare not bring her
my people couldnt bear her absence
all right all right
you are their friend and they do
not give their affections readily
come antares rigel it is late
altair aldebaran go to sleep
you must be strong and swift
go my children go
at jerusalem theyll race
the worlds finest teams
and the champion of the east
messala with his black devils
he stops at nothing to win
messala in the circus
yes
you knew him
i know him
perhaps without much liking
my people are praying for a man
to drive their team
to victory over messala
you could be that man the one
to stamp his arrogance
into the sand
my horses need only a driver
who is worthy of them
one who will rule them with love
for him theyd outrace the wind
its not possible
that is a pity
think of it to break his pride
to humble this tribune before
the very people he has degraded
just think his defeat and humiliation
at the hands of a jew
i know it is not possible
does it not delight your imagination
does it not answer your purpose
i must deal with messala
in my own way
and your way is to kill him
i see this terrible thing
in your eyes
but no matter what this man has done
you have no right to kill him
he will be punished inevitably
i dont believe in miracles
but all life is a miracle
why will you not
accept gods judgment
you do not believe in miracles
yet god once spoke to me
out of the darkness
and a star led me
to a village called bethlehem
where i found a newborn child
in a manger
and god lived in this child
by now he is a grown man
and must be ready to begin his work
that is why i have returned here
so that i may be at hand
when he comes among us
he is near
he saw the sun set this evening
as we did
perhaps hes standing in a doorway
somewhere or on a hilltop
perhaps he is a shepherd
a merchant a fisherman
but he lives
and all our lives from now on
will carry his mark
there are many paths to god my son
i hope yours will not
be too difficult
im ready for sleep
balthasar is a good man
but until all men are like him
we must keep our swords bright
and our intention true
so i must leave you
one last thought
there is no law in the arena
many are killed
i hope to see you again
fine damascus silk
fine damascus silk
esther
its judah
you are alive
you are alive
what are you doing here
what has happened
im here
im with you
wheres your father
the day they took you away
they imprisoned him
they tortured him
when they were sure he was hiding
nothing they let him go
ever since then we have been
living here in hiding
you never went back to antioch
no
the romans took everything
there was nothing left for us there
where are my mother and sister
let me tell him first
father
father something wonderful
has happened
judah benhur is alive
he has come home he is here
judah
judah benhur
my dear old friend
let me look at you
let me see you
yes yes it is true
praise god for his mercy
where are they
since that terrible day
there has been no word of them
you should have been less loyal
do not pity me master judah
in fact im twice the man i was
there is malluch my other half
we met in the dungeons of the citadel
we were released on the same day
malluch without a tongue
and i without life in my legs
since then i have been his tongue
and he has been my legs
together we make a considerable man
old friend
she always said you would return
she never gave up hope
though i hoped it
i didnt believe it
i see that your one thought is
to save your mother and sister
but suppose that isnt possible
if one purpose fails
it is good to have another
much of your fortune is safe judah
they could not make me
tell them where it is
it is there still
to put power into our hands
and buy death for the romans
thats not why i came back
judah they are dead
four years no one could live
so long in the dungeons
who lives more than one year
in the galleys
yes it is true
judah benhur
you have come back to us
like a returning faith
judah i should like to laugh again
let us laugh
we will
there will be joy again
in this house
we will celebrate among the dust
i will take him
we stood here before
a long while ago
four years
but now it seems as if
only yesterday
i was saying
if you were not a bride
i should kiss you goodbye
if i were not a bride
there would be
no goodbyes to be said
i am not a bride
why did you never marry
my father needed me
and also
its still on my finger
i said i should wear it
till i met a woman i would marry
its become a part of my hand
if messala once knew you were here
as he must
he will know where they are
and if you should find
if he says theyre dead
messala will wish they were living
ive seen too much
of what hate can do
my father is burned up with it
but ive heard of a young rabbi who
says that forgiveness is greater
and love more powerful than hatred
i believe it
esther
judah
stay alive
keep away from messala
only if i can give up
thinking and feeling
that time isnt yet come
the stone that fell from this roof
so long ago is still falling
only this time you wont be sent
to the galleys
this time you will be destroyed
youll die

four victories in the circus
in all truth
just a moment

against a jew a galley slave
perhaps i made a mistake
in coming here
you tribune
will you give me four to one
four to one

four to one sheik the difference
between a roman and a jew
or an arab
bravely spoken
now we will settle the amount
of our wager i will venture
a thousand talents

a thousand talents it will be
agreed

the first time around
you win the last time around
and you cannot win alone
you must wait for the others
steady antares

you will be our anchor
i thought theyd never love
another as they love me
they have taken me into their family
rest well my stars
tomorrow we go up to the city
then if you defeat messala and
the new governor there to see it
the news will scorch the streets
of the roman world
pontius pilate here

his heel into us
you will make him see
what men are born in this land
i only know that
i race against messala
look for the yoke
ease that strap
god forgive me for seeking vengeance
but my path is set
into your hands i commit my life
do with me as you will
the star of david
to shine out for your people
and my people together
and blind the eyes of rome

we cannot wait tribune

ive sent for him and he will come
if you wish us to keep you alive
we have to go to work now tribune
do you understand
to hack the legs off me
not yet not till ive seen him
i dont receive him with half a body
no
i told you drusus i told you
here he is
triumph complete judah
the race won the enemy destroyed
i see no enemy
what do you think you see
the smashed body of a wretched animal
theres enough of a man
still left here for you to hate
let me help you
you think theyre dead
your mother and sister
dead and the race over
it isnt over judah
theyre not dead
where are they
where are they
where are they
look for them
in the valley of the lepers
if you can recognize them
it goes on
it goes on judah
the race
the race is not over
is there a way down here
are you a madman
keep well out of this place
man
im searching for two women
a mother and daughter
there are many women
of the family of hur
we have no names here
for them
why did you say they were dead
it was what they wanted
you must not betray this faith
would you do this for them
not to see them
they are coming
love them in the way they must need
to be loved not to look at them
let them be as if you had
never come here please
is judah well
is he happy
yes he is well
your mind can be at rest for him
he is well miriam
god be with you
they have gone
we can go back
go back to what
judah they have one blessing left
to think you remember them
as they were
and live your own life
forget what is here
forget
its as though
theyre alive in a grave
but what can you do
undo what youve done
how could you have suffered them
to come here i must see them
no judah please judah
think judah think it would
tear them apart if they see you
he is here i have found him
the child has become a man
and the man i know it now
is the son of god
the promise is true
happy balthasar
life has answered you
life has been answered
god has answered it
come come with me
when the romans were marching me
to the galleys
thirst had nearly killed me
a man gave me water to drink
i went on living
i should have done better
if i had poured it into the sand
no
i am thirsty still
come and listen
i have business with rome
you insist on death
goodbye judah
you sent for me
i hope i bring you
a good conclusion to your victory
i have a message for you
from the consul your father
i honor him
as you may honor yourself
you have been made a citizen of rome
do you say nothing to this
i have just come
from the valley of stone
where my mother and sister live
whats left of their lives
by romes will
lepers outcasts without hope
i have heard this there was great
blame there very deeply regretted
their flesh is mine lord pilate
it already carries romes mark
messala is dead
what he did has had its way with him
the deed was not messalas
i knew him well
before the cruelty of rome
spread in his blood
rome destroyed messala as surely
as rome has destroyed my family
where there is greatness
great government or power
even great feeling or compassion
error also is great
we progress and mature by fault
rome has said she is ready to join
your life to hers in a great future
there are other voices
the voice for instance of arrius
waiting for you in rome
he would tell you
if i may speak in his place
not to crucify yourself
on a shadow such as old resentment
or impossible loyalties
perfect freedom has no existence
a grown man knows the world
he lives in
and for the present the world is rome
young arrius i am sure
will choose it
i am judah benhur
i cross this floor
in spoken friendship
as i would speak to arrius
but when i go up those stairs
i become the hand of caesar
ready to crush those
who challenge his authority
there are too many men
of envy and ambition
who try to disrupt
the government of rome
you have become the victor
and hero to those people
they look to you
their one true god as i call you
if you stay here you will find
yourself part of this tragedy
i am already part of this tragedy
return this to arrius
i honor him too well
to wear it any longer
even for arrius sake
i cannot protect you
from personal disaster
if you stay here
you are too great a danger
leave judea
you have my word
i was afraid
you would never come back
afraid of what would happen to you
but i see you again
your fathers waiting for me
where is he
what do you mean to do
rest sleep
for a few hours of the night
let your mind be at peace
peace
love and peace
do you think i dont long for them
as much as you do
where do you see them
if you had heard this man
from nazareth
balthasars word
he is more than balthasars word
his voiced traveled
with such a still purpose
it was more than a voice
a man more than a man
he said blessed are the merciful
for they shall obtain mercy
blessed are the peacemakers
for they shall be called
the children of god
children of god
in that dead valley
where we left them
i tell you every man of judea is
unclean and will stay unclean
until we have scoured off
our bodies the crust and filth
of being at the mercy of tyranny
no other life is possible
except to wash this land clean
in blood
yes in blood
i know there is a law in life
that blood begets more blood
as dog begets dog
death generates death
as the vulture breeds the vulture
but the voice i heard today
on the hill said
love your enemy
do good to those who
despitefully use you
all who are born in this land
hereafter can suffer as we have done
as you make us do now
are we to bear nothing together
even love
i can hardly draw breath
without feeling you in my heart
but i know
that everything i do
from this moment
bears greater pain
than you have ever suffered
it is better not to love me
it was judah benhur i loved
what has become of him
you seem to be now the very thing
you set out to destroy
giving evil for evil
hatred is turning you to stone
its as though
you had become messala
ive lost you judah
no further
what are you doing here
i was here last evening
waiting for you
i have waited all night
what has happened
where is tirzah
leave the food
i am coming closer dont be afraid
what are you doing
dont be afraid
ive heard him again
the man from nazareth
if ever words were from god
they are in everything he says
i cannot bear that
you should have never known
this hand of quiet
reaching towards us
he is going to jerusalem
we can find him there
bring tirzah
and we can go together to find him
tirzah is dying
leave the food and go
its judah
why did you tell him
yes judah yes
no nearer please god no nearer
mother
wait mother wait
let me talk with you
please
no no further please
no judah son no
mother let me see tirzah
tirzah is dying
judah if they would see jesus
of nazareth they will know
that life is everlasting
and death is nothing to fear
if you have faith
i will take them to him
no
god no
no no dear son
mother
where is tirzah
judah no
judah no
you must not go to her dear son
please
dear son
i am afraid
no cause
the world is more than we know
tirzah its judah
no judah
alms for the blind
alms for the blind
alms for the blind
why are the streets deserted
they have gone to the trial
trial whose trial
the young rabbi from nazareth
they are wanting his death
this cannot be true
alms
what has he done
nothing i know of
for the blind for the blind
help for the blind
look lepers
lepers
get away stay away
go away
lepers lepers
how can this be
i know this man
will someone help him
take pity on him
have mercy
in his pain
this look of peace
watch over them esther
we must go back
i brought you here to this
when i hoped
you havent failed esther
hail king of the jews
this is where your search
has brought you balthasar
he gave me water
and a heart to live
what has he done to merit this
he has taken the world
of our sins onto himself
to this end he said he was born
in that stable
where i first saw him
for this cause
he came into the world
for this death
this beginning
i have lived too long
as though he were carrying
in that cross
the pain of the world
so fearful and yet why is it
im not afraid anymore
the shadow of a storm
a strange darkness
but still day
his life is over
what is it
this tearing
i am in pain
i feel it too
do you see your hand
almost at the moment he died
i heard him say
father forgive them
