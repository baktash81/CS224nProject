what month is it 
april  spring in tomainia 
hilda will be in the garden 
tending the daffodils 
how she loves daffodils 
she d never cut them
for fear of hurting them 
it was like taking a life
to cut a daffodil 
sweet  gentle hilda 
a beautiful soul 
she loved animals 
and little children  too 
we ve landed  dispatches 
comrade  where are you 
the dispatches    where are they 
  are you hurt 
  take me to general schmelloffel 
if we don t deliver these 
we re defeated 
  the war s over 
  what 
we lost 
hynkel takes power 
the jewish soldier
suffered a loss of memory
and remained in hospital for years 
ignorant of the change in tomainia 
hynkel ruled the nation
with an iron fist 
under the double cross emblem
liberty was banished 
only the voice of hynkel
was heard 
adenoid hynkel said 
 tomainia was down
but today has risen  
 democracy is fragrant  
 liberty is odious  
 freedom of speech
is objectionable  
 tomainia has the greatest army  
 the greatest navy  
 but to remain great
we must sacrifice  
 we must tighten our belts  
he now speaks to field marshal
herring  minister of war 
now herr garbitsch 
minister of the interior 
he remembers his early struggles 
shared by his two loyal comrades 
a reference to the jewish people 
the phooey remarks
that for the world
he has peace in his heart 
we now pause
for station identification 
this is the pari mutual network 
bringing you
hynkel s address to the children
of the double cross 
the interpreter
is hynkel s personal translator 
reading from a prepared manuscript 
stand by for further commentary 
go ahead  tomainia 
his excellency
is about to descend the stairs 
your excellency  are you hurt 
ride in the other car 
his excellency
seems pleased as he is greeted
by tomainian children 
he pauses before a woman
with a child 
camera 
even the baby is thrilled
and seems all smiles
at the attention 
his excellency leaves the scene
and will return
along hynkelstrasse 
where he ll pass tomainia s
modern masterpieces 
the venus of today
and the thinker of tomorrow 
  how was it 
  the speech 
very good 
your reference to the jews
might have been more violent 
what 
to arouse the people s anger 
violence against the jews might make
the people forget their stomach 
you re right  things have been quiet
in the ghetto lately 
good morning  mr  jaeckel 
what s good about it 
conditions could be worse 
if you think so 
you have a great imagination 
you heard hynkel s speech 
i heard nothing 
i ve got my own troubles 
you re better off
than a lot of people 
what about the barber 
still in hospital 
he s been there since the war 
why not rent
his barbershop for him 
he won t let me  every few weeks
he writes to say he s coming back 
a pity it should be idle
all these years 
why worry 
the government
will soon take it from him 
perhaps you re right

jewish soldier

seems to be in his barbershop 
which he believes he left
a few weeks ago 
he ll have many surprises 
i m afraid so 
  yes 
  number 33 is gone 
he was to be examined 
but he s disappeared 
disappeared

wait a minute  boys 
i ve got a bright idea 
commander schultz

second in command 
oh  never mind  you

to hang people from lampposts 
what was the trouble 
a jew attacking storm troopers 
  where is he 
  there 
break ranks 
so there you are  stand him up 
get up 
you 
don t you remember me 
  you saved my life 
  me

of you as an aryan 
i m a vegetarian 
don t you remember 
we got away in my plane 
plane 
then we crashed 
now i remember 
well  how are you 
what s my friend done 
he resisted my men
painting his windows 
any brave man would resist 
i m sorry for this 
no harm 
in future you will not
be molested again 
if you or your friends
ever need help   
who did that 
one of my friends 
hynkel s palace was the centre
of the world s
greatest war machine 
behind it
was the dynamic adenoid hynkel 
whose genius ran the nation 
whose ceaseless activity kept him
occupied every moment of the day 
marshal herring is waiting 
enough 
i believe we ve got something now 
a bulletproof uniform 
the material is as light as silk 
where 
i ve arranged for a demonstration 
it will only take two minutes 
i can spare one 
professor herr kibitzen 
actions speak louder than words 
a bulletproof uniform 
one hundred percent perfect 
shoot 
far from perfect 
  where s my secretary 
  in the outer office 
call her 
take a letter 
herring here in the tower room 
we ve got something marvelous 
i shall be up 
a parachute 
the most compact in the world 
worn like a hat 
it will open in 25 feet 
demonstrate  professor 
herring 
why do you waste my time like this 
send garbitsch here 
herr garbitsch is waiting 
enough 
what s the meaning of this 
25 million for prison camps 
we need to manufacture munitions 
  we ve made a few arrests 
  how many 
five or ten thousand   
a day 
  a day 
  just a few dissenters 
dissenting about 
working hours  wage cuts 
the synthetic food  the quality
of the sawdust in the bread 
what more do they want 
it s from the finest lumber 
nevertheless  the people
are overworked  they need diversion 
the people  bah 
we might go further with the jews 
burn some of their houses 
an assault on the ghetto 
something more dramatic  when can
we be ready to invade osterlich 
three months 
i can t wait 
napaloni s army might invade first 
we must strike now 
we ll require foreign capital 
borrow it 
the bankers have refused 
one man
might make us a loan  epstein 
  epstein  he s a jew  isn t he 
  yes 
well  let s be big about it 
we ll borrow from epstein 
it might be difficult in view
of our policy towards his people 
then we ll change our policy 
tell schultz all persecution
of the jews must cease 
at least
till we ve negotiated this loan 
i don t understand it 
the whole ghetto is so quiet 
you can t imagine
what was going on 
this hynkel business 
you weren t here  you were
in the hospital  unconscious 
you don t appreciate
what a good time you were having 
if things get worse
we can go to osterlich 
that s still free 
sooner or later we ll have to go 
anyway  it s nice to see you back 
it s like the old days again  eh 
how s business 
very slow 
the men are in concentration camp 
you should fix up the women 
the beauty parlor business 
know anything about it 
you can learn 
you can practice on hannah 
hannah  get in that chair 
we ll make you look beautiful 
what for 
he s going to practice on you 
not with mud on my face 
no  we ll take some off 
make me look beautiful

he can t make you look any worse 
mrs  shoemaker s laundry 
i ll give it to her 
you sit here and enjoy yourself 
i know 
i ve seen you making eyes 
don t pay any attention to him 
i like your shop
since it s fixed up 
i wish i had a business like this 
there s no future in housework 
maybe if i save my money
i can have a barbershop some day 
but i can never save 
money slips through my fingers 
i ve always lived
up to every penny i ve earned 
why shouldn t i  you re here today
and gone tomorrow 
do you believe in god 
i do  but if there wasn t one 
would you live any different 
i wouldn t 
life could be wonderful
if people d leave you alone 
things are looking brighter now 
maybe because of you saving schultz 
funny how they ve left us alone 
too good to be true 
do you ever daydream 
i do 
that s the only time
i m really happy  dreaming 
sometimes i get so carried away
i don t know what i m doing 
aren t you like that 
we re very much alike 
  both absent minded 
  you think so 
i like absent minded people 
like the man who put his watch
in boiling water and held the egg 
all great men are absent minded 
it s a sign you re smart 
my folks didn t think so 
you have an excuse 
you were injured in the war 
i was born that way 
i wonder
why women never grow whiskers 
isn t that foolish of me 
i could kick myself in the shins 
i could   
i ll give you a shampoo 
ain t i cute 
how did you do it 
you should try it on yourself 
fixed up  you d look handsome 
four pecks a pound  new potatoes 
the potato man  i have to go 
take it easy there 
did you hurt yourself 
  careful next time 
  here s another one 
how do you do 
something s happened 
the storm troopers helped me up 
how wonderful
if they stopped hating us 
if they let us go about our business
like we used to 
how wonderful if we didn t have
to go to another country 
i don t want to go 
with all the persecution 
i still love it here 
perhaps we don t have to go 
wouldn t it be wonderful if they d
let us live and be happy again 
full stop 
nothing works 
not even a sharp pencil 
i m surrounded by incompetent 
stupid  sterile stenographers 
i ll get you a pen 
don t bother  i won t send it 
get out  get out 
we ve just discovered
the most wonderful poison gas 
it will kill everybody   
all right  later

  they were 
how many were going to strike 
three thousand of them

i don t want dissatisfied workers 
these men are skilled craftsmen 
let s train others first 
then shoot them 
cannot afford to be lenient 
the rhythm of production
will be affected 
rhythm   
all right  have your rhythm 
spare the strikers and permit them
to return to work 
but mark them for future reference 
that s my department 
i ll attend to that  this way 
the strike leaders are all
brunettes  not one blond 
troublemakers 
worse than jews 
  then wipe them out 
   doucement  
we ll get rid of the jews first 
then concentrate on the brunettes 
we shall never have peace
till we have a pure aryan race 
how wonderful  tomainia 
a nation of blue eyed blonds 
why not
a blond europe  asia  america 
  and a brunette dictator 
  of the world 
why not 
aut caesar aut nullus  the world s
effete  worn out  afraid 
no nation would dare oppose you 
dictator of the world 
it s your destiny  we ll kill off
the jews  wipe out the brunettes 
then will come forth
a pure aryan race 
beautiful blond aryans 
they will love you 
they will worship you as a god 
no  you mustn t say it 
you make me afraid of myself 
dictator of the world 
we ll invade osterlich first 
after that we can bluff 
the nations will capitulate 
the world will be under your thumb 
leave me  i want to be alone

the children of the double cross 
it seems like the old days again 
how long is it going to last

maybe

bad news  the invasion of osterlich
will have to be delayed 
  what 
  epstein refuses to lend the money 
epstein refuses  eh 
send for schultz 
epstein refuses 
what did he say 
he complained of the persecution
and said he wouldn t have any
dealings with a mediaeval maniac 
he ll deal with a mediaeval maniac
more than he thinks 
first i shall deal with his people 
  your excellency 
  call out the storm troopers 
a little mediaeval entertainment
in the ghetto 
at such a time
i think it ill advised 
such demonstrations
demoralize the country 
indeed 
since when
do you care about the ghetto 
i speak in the interests of our party
and the cause of humanity 
you need a holiday 
fresh air 
a little outdoor exercise 
i ll send you
to a concentration camp 
place schultz under arrest 
very well  but remember my words 
your cause is doomed to failure
because it is built on the stupid
persecution of innocent people 
your policy is worse than a crime 
it s a tragic blunder 
traitor  traitor 
you re a double dyed democrat 
schultz  why have you forsaken me 
excellency 
here are the notes for your speech 
i ll not need them 
what i say will not be directed
to the children of the double cross
but to the children of israel 
that hynkel isn t such a bad fellow
after all 
most amusing 
get a hynkel badge 
a hynkel badge 
a fine photo on each 
  we d better go home 
  yeah 
let s hurry 
wait a minute

lock all the doors 
you men  stay right here 
we ve got to make a stand 
we might as well die
as live like this 
wait a minute 
we have a social call to make here 
wait a minute 
schultz gave strict orders
not to molest anyone in this court 
these jews attacked us 
i don t care 
orders were to keep out 
you saw that 
i can t help it  schultz s orders 
let s get going 
orders or not 
i m going to get that girl

schultz arrested

mr  jaeckel says it s beautiful 
wonderful green fields 
and they grow apples and grapes 
his brother s got a vineyard 
mr  jaeckel
said he d take me with him 
now we can all go together 
it ll be wonderful
living in the country 
much better than a smoky old city 
and if we work hard and
don t eat much  we can save money
and buy a chicken farm 
there s money
to be made in chickens 
look at that star 
isn t it beautiful 
hynkel with all his power
can never touch that 
all right  the coast is clear 
commander schultz escaped 
he s hiding in my cellar 
he s holding a meeting at midnight
and he wants you to be there 
hannah  you come and help
mrs  jaeckel with the supper 
all right  i ll be down 
i don t understand it 
this crazy midnight supper   
what does this schultz want of us 
  he wants us to blow up the palace 
  what 
we jewish people shouldn t
get mixed up in such a business 
i know it but schultz
has them all hypnotized 
  i knew he was up to some mischief 
  sure he is 
i found him putting a coin
in one of your puddings 
don t worry  i ve fixed everything 
wait and see 
gentlemen  may i claim
your indulgence for a moment 
we are here tonight
to rid the country of a tyrant 
in order to carry this out
one of us must die 
in ancient times the aryan tribe
of the langobardians
made human sacrifice
to the god thor 
at a feast
by lottery the victim was chosen 
tonight  at this feast 
one of you will be chosen 
each man will receive a pudding 
concealed in one of these is a coin 
whoever gets it
must give up his life
but he will join the long line
of history s noble martyrs
and will rid his country
of a tyrant 
i know that it is the wish
of all of us
to be chosen this night
to die for tomainia 
much as i should like to participate
in this ordeal  i cannot   
why 
don t you understand 
he s too well known 
it must be somebody like us 
i can t see it like that 
it is a question of my honor 
it is very embarrassing 
commander schultz 
i apologize for my friend 
let me say  on behalf
of myself and the others 
that we consider it a great
privilege to die for our country 
very well  then 
gentlemen  i shall now retire
until fate has chosen the liberator 
until then    hail hynk   
what am i saying 
gentlemen 
we have pledged our honor 
proceed 
gentlemen  the coin is here 
what s the meaning of this 
somebody made a fool of us 
  i did 
  what 
i put a coin in every pudding 
blowing up palaces
and wanting to kill people 
we re in enough trouble 
hannah s right 
we ve all been foolish 
our place is at home 
looking after our own affairs 
the papers say
schultz may be in the ghetto 
here  read it for yourself 
hannah  read that 
 mystery surrounds the disappearance
of ex commander schultz  
 at police hq it was believed
he may be hiding in the ghetto  
 a certain jewish barber 
reported to be a friend of schultz

questioning  we never saw him again

napaloni will leave
the invasion of osterlich to me 
and this 
  what is it 
  your declaration of war 
peace is declared 
2 975 000 eager citizens
are massed in the station square
awaiting benzino napaloni 
entering the station is our phooey 
ready to greet his guest 
this will cement the friendship
between our phooey
and the dictator of bacteria 
his excellency is about to greet
the bacterian ambassador 
how do you do 
garbitsch   
see about the photography 
tell the press to see that
our phooey is well photographed 
  not the back of his head 
  yes  sir 
napaloni s train

from a pink and white carriage
napaloni and his wife will step out
and adenoid hynkel will deliver
his address of welcome

your clock is a slow 
this way 
it s a very nice people 
the people are very nice 
thank you 
he s my husband 
you make a mistake 
you make a big a mistake 
napaloni s army shall not invade
osterlich  it belongs to me 
we shall not discuss
the osterlich situation 
this interview is to impress on him
the force of your personality 
to make him feel your superiority 
napaloni
is aggressive  domineering 
we must put him in his place 
but how 
by means of psychology 
by making him feel inferior 
this can be done subtly 
for instance 
i have arranged
that he ll be looking up at you 
you looking down at him 
his position will be inferior 
then again we shall seat him
here beside your bust
so that if you relax
that will always be glaring at him 
where is he now 
resting 
i have arranged that he will enter
from the far end of the room 
another psychological triumph 
he will have the embarrassment
of walking the entire floor 
signor napaloni
is now leaving his room 
he s coming 
quick  give me a flower 
at all times
be above him  before him 
entering or leaving
you must be first 
hello  hynky

in modern warfare 
where s the propellers 
for going under the water

and cross over into osterlich 
herring and i
will be waiting at the capital

  my dear adenoid 
  benzino 
i ve been looking for you 
let s go to some quiet place
where we can talk a things over 
  as you wish 
  an excellent idea  to the buffet 
of course  this way 
there s a tomainian proverb   
funny  i wish i understand it 
now about the border 
yes  no problem 
it should be no trouble 
  what s the matter 
  wait 
you  too  out 
out 
  so    the border question 
  yes 
it s just a matter of detail 
formalities 
strawberries 
  have you any english mustard 
  english mustard 
  that s da hot a stuff 
  very hot 
good shape 
cream 
hynky  i m going to make this
very simple 
you agree not to invade osterlich 
i agree not to invade osterlich 
we sign  then i remove
my troops from the border 
when your troops
are gone  i sign 
that s a right 
just a minute 
you don t understand 
first we sign 
then i remove a da troops 
  precisely  i sign after 
  just a minute 
hey  spook  treaty 
hold a dis 
now  look  you sign a
dis treaty first 
then i remove my troops after 
why are we arguing 
you said i remove first 
i can t sign while they re there 
  i won t remove them till you sign 
  why not 
  why should i 
  osterlich is a free country 
your soldiers are there 
and they ll stay until you sign 
i ll blow them off 
this won t get us anywhere 
to quote an old latin phrase   
strawberries 
where s a my sandwich 
another one 
i don t get this treatment
in my own joint 
can t we discuss this
without passion 
i m not a passionate  i m just   
i want him to sign the treaty 
what would my people think 
signing such a treaty
when your soldiers
are on the border 
i won t move until you sign 
not until you clear the border
will i sign 
then they remain 
then i kick them off 
one move from you and my artillery
will blow you to pieces 
and my aeroplanes will bomb
your artillery like that 
you want a start a world war 
you and the world
i ll throw in the ocean 
strawberries 
your excellency  we have   
i got a my guns here in the pass
and i ll blow him to pieces 
what s the matter  what ails you 
this isn t like you 
hey  garbitsch  come here

mustard on his strawberries 
what else can you expect
from hynky 
my little bambino

tomainia   
you cannot treat bacteria this way 
i ll take the bacterian people
and tear them apart  like this 
look what he s doing

there are minor details
to be cleaned up

  so what 
  can t we come to an agreement 
when he signs 
i sign nothing 
i must speak to you alone 
do you mind 
mind  i don t mind 
sign  sign 
he ll have the advantage 
it s a mere scrap of paper 
when his troops are off the border 
we can move in 
i ll sign 
what  hold a this 
ah  my little hynky 
my dictator brother 
i knew we have a no trouble

and 500 machine guns 
  good 
  good 
are we ready to start 
  yes 
  yes 
gentlemen 
schultz 
i m happy you re with us again 
thank you 
where are we going 
you re invading osterlich 
they re coming 
your excellency 
the world awaits your words 
what s happened 
he looks strange 
what s schultz doing here 
pardoned  i suppose 
his excellency herr garbitsch 
secretary of the interior 
minister of propaganda   
corona veniet delectis 
victory shall come to the worthy 
today  democracy  liberty
and equality
are words to fool the people 
no nation
can progress with such ideas 
they stand in the way of action 
therefore  we abolish them 
in the future  each man will serve
the state with absolute obedience 
let him who refuses beware 
citizenship will be taken away
from all jews and non aryans 
they are inferior and therefore
enemies of the state 
it is the duty of all true aryans
to hate and despise them 
this nation
is annexed to the tomainian empire 
and the people will obey the laws
bestowed on us by our great leader 
the dictator of tomainia 
the conqueror of osterlich 
the future emperor of the world 
you must speak 
i can t 
you must  it s our only hope 
hope   
i m sorry
but i don t want to be an emperor 
that s not my business 
i don t want to rule
or conquer anyone 
i should like to help everyone 
jew  gentile  black man  white 
we all want to help one another 
human beings are like that 
we want to live by each other s
happiness  not misery 
we don t want to hate one another 
in this world 
the good earth is rich
and can provide for everyone 
the way of life can be free
and beautiful
but we have lost the way 
greed has poisoned men s souls 
has barricaded the world with hate 
has goose stepped us into bloodshed 
we have developed speed
but have shut ourselves in 
machinery has left us in want 
our knowledge has made us cynical 
our cleverness  hard and unkind 
we think too much
and feel too little 
more than machinery
we need humanity 
more than cleverness
we need kindness and gentleness 
without these qualities  life will
be violent and all will be lost   
the aeroplane and radio
have brought us closer 
these inventions cry out
for the goodness in man 
cry out for universal brotherhood 
for the unity of us all 
even now
my voice is reaching millions 
millions of despairing men 
women and children 
victims of a system
that makes men torture
and imprison innocent people 
to those who can hear me i say 
do not despair 
the misery upon us
is but the passing of greed 
the bitterness of men who fear
the way of human progress 
the hate of men will pass 
and dictators die 
and the power they took
will return to the people 
so long as men die
liberty will never perish 
soldiers 
don t give yourselves to brutes 
men who despise you  enslave you 
regiment your lives 
tell you what to think and feel 
who drill you  treat you like cattle
and use you as cannon fodder 
don t give yourselves to these men 
machine men with machine minds
and machine hearts 
you are not machines 
you are not cattle  you are men 
you have
the love of humanity in you 
don t hate  only the unloved
and the unnatural hate 
soldiers  don t fight for slavery 
fight for liberty 
st luke says   the kingdom of god
is within man  
not in one man nor a group of men 
but in all men  in you 
you have the power
to create machines 
the power to create happiness 
you have the power to make
this life free and beautiful 
to make this life
a wonderful adventure 
in the name of democracy 
let us use that power 
let us all unite 
let us fight for a new world 
a world
that will give men a chance to work 
that will give youth a future
and old age security 
promising these things 
brutes have risen 
but they lie  they do not fulfill
that promise  they never will 
dictators free themselves
but they enslave the people 
now let us fight
to fulfill that promise 
let us fight to free the world 
to do away with national barriers 
to do away with greed 
with hate and intolerance 
let us fight for a world of reason 
a world where science and progress
will lead to the happiness of all 
soldiers  in the name of democracy 
let us unite 
hannah 
can you hear me 
wherever you are  look up  hannah 
the clouds are lifting 
the sun is breaking through 
we are coming out of the darkness
into a new world 
a kindlier world 
where men will rise
above their hate  their greed
and their brutality 
look up  hannah 
the soul of man
has been given wings 
he is flying into the rainbow 
into the light of hope 
into the future 
the glorious future
