weve landed dispatches
comrade where are you
the dispatches where are they
are you hurt
take me to general schmelloffel
if we dont deliver these
were defeated
the wars over
what
we lost
hynkel takes power
the jewish soldier
suffered a loss of memory
and remained in hospital for years
ignorant of the change in tomainia
hynkel ruled the nation
with an iron fist
under the doublecross emblem
liberty was banished
only the voice of hynkel
was heard
adenoid hynkel said
tomainia was down
but today has risen
democracy is fragrant
liberty is odious
freedom of speech
is objectionable
tomainia has the greatest army
the greatest navy
but to remain great
we must sacrifice
we must tighten our belts
he now speaks to field marshal
herring minister of war
now herr garbitsch
minister of the interior
he remembers his early struggles
shared by his two loyal comrades
a reference to the jewish people
the phooey remarks
that for the world
he has peace in his heart
we now pause
for station identification
this is the parimutual network
bringing you
hynkels address to the children
of the doublecross
the interpreter
is hynkels personal translator
reading from a prepared manuscript
stand by for further commentary
go ahead tomainia
his excellency
is about to descend the stairs
your excellency are you hurt
ride in the other car
his excellency
seems pleased as he is greeted
by tomainian children
he pauses before a woman
with a child
camera
even the baby is thrilled
and seems all smiles
at the attention
his excellency leaves the scene
and will return
along hynkelstrasse
where hell pass tomainias
modern masterpieces
the venus of today
and the thinker of tomorrow
how was it
the speech
very good
your reference to the jews
might have been more violent
what
to arouse the peoples anger
violence against the jews might make
the people forget their stomach
youre right things have been quiet
in the ghetto lately
good morning mr jaeckel
whats good about it
conditions could be worse
if you think so
you have a great imagination
you heard hynkels speech
i heard nothing
ive got my own troubles
youre better off
than a lot of people
what about the barber
still in hospital
hes been there since the war
why not rent
his barbershop for him
he wont let me every few weeks
he writes to say hes coming back
a pity it should be idle
all these years
why worry
the government
will soon take it from him
perhaps youre right
not such a good morning after all
now you said it
hannah
on the mantelpiece is my tobacco

whats my friend done
he resisted my men
painting his windows
any brave man would resist
im sorry for this
no harm
in future you will not
be molested again
if you or your friends
ever need help
who did that
one of my friends
hynkels palace was the centre
of the worlds
greatest war machine
behind it
was the dynamic adenoid hynkel
whose genius ran the nation
whose ceaseless activity kept him
occupied every moment of the day
marshal herring is waiting
enough
i believe weve got something now
a bulletproof uniform
the material is as light as silk
where
ive arranged for a demonstration
it will only take two minutes
i can spare one
professor herr kibitzen
actions speak louder than words
a bulletproof uniform
one hundred percent perfect
shoot
far from perfect
wheres my secretary
in the outer office
call her
take a letter
herring here in the tower room
weve got something marvelous
i shall be up
a parachute
the most compact in the world
worn like a hat
it will open in 25 feet
demonstrate professor
herring
why do you waste my time like this
send garbitsch here
herr garbitsch is waiting
enough
whats the meaning of this
25 million for prison camps
we need to manufacture munitions
weve made a few arrests
how many
five or ten thousand
a day
a day
just a few dissenters
dissenting about
working hours wage cuts
the synthetic food the quality
of the sawdust in the bread
what more do they want
its from the finest lumber
nevertheless the people
are overworked they need diversion
the people bah
we might go further with the jews
burn some of their houses
an assault on the ghetto
something more dramatic when can
we be ready to invade osterlich
three months
i cant wait
napalonis army might invade first
we must strike now
well require foreign capital
borrow it
the bankers have refused
one man
might make us a loan epstein
epstein hes a jew isnt he
yes
well lets be big about it
well borrow from epstein
it might be difficult in view
of our policy towards his people
then well change our policy
tell schultz all persecution
of the jews must cease
at least
till weve negotiated this loan
i dont understand it
the whole ghetto is so quiet
you cant imagine
what was going on
this hynkel business
you werent here you were
in the hospital unconscious
you dont appreciate
what a good time you were having
if things get worse
we can go to osterlich
thats still free
sooner or later well have to go
anyway its nice to see you back
its like the old days again eh
hows business
very slow
the men are in concentration camp
you should fix up the women
the beauty parlor business

i wish i had a business like this
theres no future in housework
maybe if i save my money
i can have a barbershop some day
but i can never save
money slips through my fingers
ive always lived
up to every penny ive earned
why shouldnt i youre here today
and gone tomorrow
do you believe in god
i do but if there wasnt one
would you live any different
i wouldnt
life could be wonderful
if peopled leave you alone
things are looking brighter now
maybe because of you saving schultz
funny how theyve left us alone
too good to be true
do you ever daydream
i do
thats the only time
im really happy dreaming
sometimes i get so carried away
i dont know what im doing
arent you like that
were very much alike
both absentminded
you think so
i like absentminded people
like the man who put his watch
in boiling water and held the egg
all great men are absentminded
its a sign youre smart
my folks didnt think so
you have an excuse
you were injured in the war
i was born that way
i wonder
why women never grow whiskers
isnt that foolish of me
i could kick myself in the shins
i could
ill give you a shampoo
aint i cute
how did you do it
you should try it on yourself
fixed up youd look handsome
four pecks a pound new potatoes
the potato man i have to go
take it easy there
did you hurt yourself
careful next time
heres another one
how do you do
somethings happened
the storm troopers helped me up
how wonderful
if they stopped hating us
if they let us go about our business
like we used to
how wonderful if we didnt have
to go to another country
i dont want to go
with all the persecution
i still love it here
perhaps we dont have to go
wouldnt it be wonderful if theyd
let us live and be happy again
full stop
nothing works
not even a sharp pencil
im surrounded by incompetent
stupid sterile stenographers
ill get you a pen

ill attend to that this way
the strike leaders are all

bad news the invasion of osterlich
will have to be delayed
what
epstein refuses to lend the money
epstein refuses eh
send for schultz
epstein refuses
what did he say
he complained of the persecution
and said he wouldnt have any
dealings with a mediaeval maniac
hell deal with a mediaeval maniac
more than he thinks
first i shall deal with his people
your excellency
call out the storm troopers
a little mediaeval entertainment
in the ghetto
at such a time
i think it illadvised
such demonstrations
demoralize the country
indeed
since when
do you care about the ghetto
i speak in the interests of our party
and the cause of humanity
you need a holiday
fresh air
a little outdoor exercise
ill send you
to a concentration camp
place schultz under arrest
very well but remember my words
your cause is doomed to failure
because it is built on the stupid
persecution of innocent people
your policy is worse than a crime
its a tragic blunder
traitor traitor
youre a doubledyed democrat
schultz why have you forsaken me
excellency
here are the notes for your speech
ill not need them
what i say will not be directed
to the children of the doublecross
but to the children of israel
that hynkel isnt such a bad fellow
after all
most amusing
get a hynkel badge
a hynkel badge
a fine photo on each
wed better go home

his brothers got a vineyard
mr jaeckel

itll be wonderful
living in the country
much better than a smoky old city
and if we work hard and
dont eat much we can save money
and buy a chicken farm
theres money
to be made in chickens
look at that star
isnt it beautiful
hynkel with all his power
can never touch that
all right the coast is clear
commander schultz escaped
hes hiding in my cellar
hes holding a meeting at midnight
and he wants you to be there
hannah you come and help
mrs jaeckel with the supper
all right ill be down
i dont understand it
this crazy midnight supper
what does this schultz want of us
he wants us to blow up the palace
what
we jewish people shouldnt
get mixed up in such a business
i know it but schultz
has them all hypnotized
i knew he was up to some mischief
sure he is
i found him putting a coin
in one of your puddings
dont worry ive fixed everything
wait and see
gentlemen may i claim
your indulgence for a moment
we are here tonight
to rid the country of a tyrant
in order to carry this out
one of us must die
in ancient times the aryan tribe
of the langobardians
made human sacrifice
to the god thor
at a feast
by lottery the victim was chosen
tonight at this feast
one of you will be chosen
each man will receive a pudding
concealed in one of these is a coin
whoever gets it
must give up his life
but he will join the long line
of historys noble martyrs
and will rid his country
of a tyrant
i know that it is the wish
of all of us
to be chosen this night
to die for tomainia
much as i should like to participate
in this ordeal i cannot
why
dont you understand
hes too well known
it must be somebody like us
i cant see it like that
it is a question of my honor
it is very embarrassing
commander schultz
i apologize for my friend
let me say on behalf
of myself and the others
that we consider it a great
privilege to die for our country
very well then
gentlemen i shall now retire
until fate has chosen the liberator
until then hail hynk
what am i saying
gentlemen
we have pledged our honor
proceed
gentlemen the coin is here
whats the meaning of this
somebody made a fool of us
i did
what
i put a coin in every pudding
blowing up palaces
and wanting to kill people
were in enough trouble
hannahs right
weve all been foolish
our place is at home
looking after our own affairs
the papers say
schultz may be in the ghetto
here read it for yourself
hannah read that
mystery surrounds the disappearance
of excommander schultz

you make a mistake
you make a biga mistake
napalonis army shall not invade
osterlich it belongs to me
we shall not discuss
the osterlich situation
this interview is to impress on him
the force of your personality
to make him feel your superiority
napaloni
is aggressive domineering
we must put him in his place
but how
by means of psychology
by making him feel inferior
this can be done subtly
for instance
i have arranged
that hell be looking up at you
you looking down at him
his position will be inferior
then again we shall seat him
here beside your bust
so that if you relax
that will always be glaring at him
where is he now
resting
i have arranged that he will enter
from the far end of the room
another psychological triumph
he will have the embarrassment
of walking the entire floor
signor napaloni
is now leaving his room
hes coming
quick give me a flower
at all times
be above him before him
entering or leaving
you must be first
hello hynky

thank you
where are we going

your excellency
the world awaits your words
whats happened
he looks strange
whats schultz doing here
pardoned i suppose
his excellency herr garbitsch
secretary of the interior
minister of propaganda
corona veniet delectis
victory shall come to the worthy
today democracy liberty
and equality
are words to fool the people
no nation
can progress with such ideas
they stand in the way of action
therefore we abolish them
in the future each man will serve
the state with absolute obedience
let him who refuses beware
citizenship will be taken away
from all jews and nonaryans
they are inferior and therefore
enemies of the state
it is the duty of all true aryans
to hate and despise them
this nation
is annexed to the tomainian empire
and the people will obey the laws
bestowed on us by our great leader
the dictator of tomainia
the conqueror of osterlich
the future emperor of the world
you must speak
i cant
you must its our only hope
hope
im sorry
but i dont want to be an emperor
thats not my business
i dont want to rule
or conquer anyone
i should like to help everyone
jew gentile black man white
we all want to help one another
human beings are like that
we want to live by each others
happiness not misery
we dont want to hate one another
in this world
the good earth is rich
and can provide for everyone
the way of life can be free
and beautiful
but we have lost the way
greed has poisoned mens souls
has barricaded the world with hate
has goosestepped us into bloodshed
we have developed speed
but have shut ourselves in
machinery has left us in want
our knowledge has made us cynical
our cleverness hard and unkind
we think too much
and feel too little
more than machinery
we need humanity
more than cleverness
we need kindness and gentleness
without these qualities life will
be violent and all will be lost
the aeroplane and radio
have brought us closer
these inventions cry out
for the goodness in man
cry out for universal brotherhood
for the unity of us all
even now
my voice is reaching millions
millions of despairing men
women and children
victims of a system
that makes men torture
and imprison innocent people
to those who can hear me i say
do not despair
the misery upon us
is but the passing of greed
the bitterness of men who fear
the way of human progress
the hate of men will pass
and dictators die
and the power they took
will return to the people
so long as men die
liberty will never perish
soldiers
dont give yourselves to brutes
men who despise you enslave you
regiment your lives
tell you what to think and feel
who drill you treat you like cattle
and use you as cannon fodder
dont give yourselves to these men
machine men with machine minds
and machine hearts
you are not machines
you are not cattle you are men
you have
the love of humanity in you
dont hate only the unloved
and the unnatural hate
soldiers dont fight for slavery
fight for liberty
st luke says the kingdom of god
is within man
not in one man nor a group of men
but in all men in you
you have the power
to create machines
the power to create happiness
you have the power to make
this life free and beautiful
to make this life
a wonderful adventure
in the name of democracy
let us use that power
let us all unite
let us fight for a new world
a world
that will give men a chance to work
that will give youth a future
and old age security
promising these things
brutes have risen
but they lie they do not fulfill
that promise they never will
dictators free themselves
but they enslave the people
now let us fight
to fulfill that promise
let us fight to free the world
to do away with national barriers
to do away with greed
with hate and intolerance
let us fight for a world of reason
a world where science and progress
will lead to the happiness of all
soldiers in the name of democracy
let us unite
hannah
can you hear me
wherever you are look up hannah
the clouds are lifting
the sun is breaking through
we are coming out of the darkness
into a new world
a kindlier world
where men will rise
above their hate their greed
and their brutality
look up hannah
the soul of man
has been given wings
he is flying into the rainbow
into the light of hope
into the future
the glorious future
