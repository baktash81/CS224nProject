i ll do the rest of my yelling
while i m taking you back 
look  the guy
could have pressed charges 
you sold him a rock in a box
for 20 bucks 
oh  that s funny 
it s not funny  it s anything but funny 
what if they d called carl and lois
instead of me 
i guess you d have to find us
new foster parents  then 
is that what you re trying to do 
you guys  that s
a very dangerous game  i m telling you 
one and   
no 
you know  the word  harmonizing 
comes from the word  harmony   
  so 
  so i m saying you re still half a step off 
oh  really  well  that s funny
because my vocal instructor 
who is a paid vocal instructor 
didn t notice that  but you did 
here s the note 
you re late 
and you interrupted rehearsal 
i m very sorry 
get in there  hurry up 
babe  maybe we should skip this one
and just play the hit 
  they re all hits  baby 
  you re right 
  hey  bernie 
  carl 
your food s on your trays 
yummy  it s too bad we already ate 
fine  it ll be lunch tomorrow 
all right  could we just get back
to the issue at hand  okay 
i m a kind woman  okay 
in fact  everyone s always asking 
 lois  why are you so kind  
but we have rules  okay 
we serve dinner at a certain time  so
we can finish dinner at a certain time 
so we can drop our rock manifesto
on the world at a certain time 
okay  but those times have come
and gone  so   
oh  where were they 
look  this whole thing is my fault  okay 
we were just getting caught up
and we were having so much fun   
whoa  yeah 
   that i just lost track of time 
i m sorry  really  my apologies 
now  why don t we just
get them to their room
and you guys can continue
making that magic 
  thanks for covering for us 
  andi  andi  listen 
you cannot afford to screw this up 
you ve only been here
two months  okay 
this is your fifth set
of foster parents in three years 
the johnsons don t count 
we were there for two hours 
do you know the reaction i get
when i tell people
i m trying to place
11 and 16 year old siblings 
it ain t a good one  okay 
you guys mess this up  that s it 
i don t have any more favors
i can call in 
i m gonna have to
place you two separately 
no  you know i won t
let that happen  bernie 
we stay together 
all right  then
take a little advice from me  okay 
a technique that i ve learned 
when somebody who i   
   who i don t particularly like is saying
something that i don t want to hear 
i just nod and i go   mmm hmm   
it works wonders 
mmm hmm 
okay  i m through with you guys 
i ll tell you what  i better not get
any more phone calls
about a trick with a brick
or a scam with a ham   
okay  it was a good talk  bernie 
thank you very much for stopping by 
what are you guys   
good boy  somebody s tired today  huh 
i am 
friday 
  andi 
  yeah 
  friday s gone 
  what 
  friday  come here 
  where d he go 
good god 
you two are just a bundle of energy 
good morning 
stop shouting 
my vocal instructor said getting
frightened is bad for my pitch 
what are you doing up so early 
  just thought we d get some   
  breakfast 
all right  so  i unlocked the pantry 
your cereal s in there 
you know how to get it 
i m not your servant  all right 
i am obliged to prepare two meals
a day  that s lunch and dinner 
friday 
what 
i said 
 bruce  what is the day after thursday  
  friday 
  thanks 
fine  get weird on me 
i can handle weird 
okay  i don t need your attitude
about setting the table  okay 
don t be lazy 
it needs cinnamon 
or is it cinnamon that carl s allergic to 
well  one way to find out  i guess 
let s see him harmonize
with a tongue the size of a beehive 
wait  you just reminded me
of this really funny story 
i was walking and i stepped on a bee
and it stung me 
so then  i went and took care of my foot 
then i went back for the bee
to throw it outside and i thought 
 you know  i d be safe because
bees can t sting you more than once   
right  i mean  right  it was crazy 
i mean  isn t that crazy 
excuse me 
you owe me 30 seconds of my life 
and i will collect 
thanks for the heart attack 
of course i checked in there 
maybe they re in the kids  room 
carl  did you eat the bacon 
stay close  friday 
did i leave my whitening strips in here 
he d usually be here by now 
you know  maybe he can t hear it 
it s mealtime 
he could hear it on the moon 
he s probably just wandering around 
friday  friday 
  what are we gonna do 
  come on  friday 
friday  come on 
maybe he ran down this alley 
friday 
you don t think he went in there 
do you 
no  why would he go in there 
he s probably just out looking for food 
friday 
how cute  i want one 
nice haircut 
thanks  dave 
i was hoping you d notice 
oh  i was actually
talking about the pomeranian 
but yours is  yours is really nice  too 
  you did something new to it 
  i did 
and i m pretty sure you could tell
when i first got it done
because you kind of looked at me
and then looked away 
and then looked back like 
 hey  something s different   
but then you didn t say anything
and i was like   men   
so then the next day i tried
to compliment you on your hair 
you know 
giving you a little hint here but   
no  absolutely  i totally remember that 
anyways  it looks great 
can i help you 
no  no  we re just looking for our dog 
i don t suppose you ve seen him 
have you 
no 
friday  that s a funny name 
i bet when you find him  you ll say 
 thank god it s friday   
right  it s a joke  so   
i don t think
i ve ever seen you around here before 
  do you go to thomas jefferson 
  i will actually  in the fall  andi 
dave 
my family just moved here
a couple of months ago 
that s cool  how do you like it so far 
what s not to like 
  we have to go 
  no problem 
you know  if he doesn t show up soon 
you might want to check the pound 
  friday  friday  there he is 
  there he is 
  there he is 
  there he is  friday  friday 
  your dog 
  yeah  that s our dog 
yeah  he just got in 
yeah  i know  we just saw him 
well  i m always glad
when these things have a happy ending 
we re open till 6 00  get your parents 
come back  we ll figure it out 
wait  wait   
come on  we re already here 
it s our dog 
yeah  well  there s a lot of paperwork 
grown up paperwork 
there s always a guy
who screws up the paperwork 
but you see this guy  i m not that guy 
we can t let him out alone anymore 
i mean  if he gets picked up again 
we might not get him back 
and things are gonna get
so much harder when school starts 
look  bruce  i think we need
to find friday a new home 
  well  you know  i ve got a few ideas 
  no 
we ve been hiding him
in alleys and garages 
in the woods for three years 
don t you think he deserves
a real home with a real family 
but we are a real family 
let s get out of here 
  you kids  hold it right there 
  we can t get in trouble again 
  but we didn t do anything wrong 
  you want to tell them that 
oh  my god 
  friday  no  get back here 
  bruce 
come on 
  you got anything 
  no 
forget it 
let s just find friday
and get out of here 
friday 
circuits are fried 
friday 
bruce  stay close 
wow  andi  look at all this stuff 
careful 
friday 
friday  where are you  boy 
  what s that 
  it s just an old hotel 
hotels don t make footsteps 
people make footsteps when they walk
through hotels with their feet 
good point  come on 
go  go  go 
friday  stay back 
do you think they belong to anyone 
if they did  would they be here 
better here than the pound 
friday  wait 
  look at that 
  okay 
what about just  you know 
leaving friday with them tonight 
one night 
good night  guys  sleep tight 
so i mean it s supposed to be
a teacher appreciation lunch  right 
but then it ends up
being more work for us
if we have to set it up
and then clean it up 
i mean  sometimes  you know 
i could appreciate
a little less appreciation  you know 
don t nod and  mmm hmm  me 
i taught you the nod and  mmm hmm   
yeah  that s true 
but i d like to think i ve made it my own 
oh  really 
  what s wrong 
  it s these kids  the other night 
  andi and bruce 
  yeah 
  are they okay 
  i don t know 
i mean  it s bad enough
they lost their parents 
if they can t work this situation out 
i don t know if we re gonna be able
to find a family
that s gonna take the both of them 
you do everything you can for them 
you know 
you can t bring home
your work and let it make you crazy 
  you re right 
  yeah 
  love you 
  love you  too 
it s too bad 
you know  they really are good kids 
it s three hungry dogs 
grab as much as you can 
that s quite a load there 
yeah  just getting some breakfast 
what  are you feeding
the whole neighborhood 
okay  you wouldn t even touch this
the first time 
i don t eat  you re angry 
i eat  you re angry 
okay  fine  people  eat 
lucky for you i saved your dinners 
you can start with those 
come on

you know  if you would eat
the meals i make 
you wouldn t be so hungry
in the morning 
you re right  thank you so much  lois

i m hearing something 
what 
  what s his problem 
  i don t know  why are you asking me 
stop howling  please 
yes  i d like to call in a complaint
about a howling dog 
that s it 
all that just so
you could look out a window 
never mind 
wow  even lenny
and georgia won t touch it 
we need to go get
some real dog food for them 
wait  who 
lenny and georgia 
that s what i named the new dogs

bruce  i m not kidding  okay 
i m glad
that friday s getting along well with
dog number one and dog number two 
but we re barely keeping our dog safe 
i mean  do you know what happens
if we get caught in here 
trespassing  breaking and entering 
you heard what bernie said 
they d split us up and ship us off 
are you even listening 
so i ll stay here and keep them quiet
while you go out
and get some real food  okay 
okay  fine  but just for now 
and i ll be back 
stay  friday  stay  georgia 
you better keep them quiet 
you like to fetch 
  hey  i see you found your dog 
  yeah  he s fine 
that s great 
  can i help you find anything 
  no  just getting some dog food 
  that s 40 pounds  by the way 
  yeah  that s probably right 
for that little dog on the flier 
40 pounds 
well  the thing is  i actually   
i have three dogs 
two of them are strays 
  my parents  they just love animals 
  that s great 
yeah  you know  they re the best 
i m really lucky 
we have this big yard
and we just rescue dogs all the time 
  all the time 
  well  yeah  whenever 
you know what  here  come with me 
  they re so cute 
  yeah 
we adopt out dogs here 
but we can t get anybody
to take these guys 
they re not puppies anymore 
and everybody always wants puppies 
tell me about it 
they re also kind of   
well  they re loveably defective 
cooper  he s my favorite 
i think he s actually half goat 
there s not a substance on earth
he can t chew through 
he s been through pocketbooks 
cell phones  shoes  handbags 
even ate through a license plate once 
this is shep 
yeah  she s got some herding issues 
  pushy 
  i like pushy 
so  they ve got quirks 
i mean  they re still adorable 
good  i m glad you think so 
because you re taking them 
what  no 
the owner says
we can t keep them forever
and if i can t find a place to put them 
then they re going to the pound 
look  i m sorry 
but there s no way that i can just   
you re already taking care
of a few strays  what s three more 
  three 
  oh  yeah  you re gonna love this guy 
romeo  romeo  romeo 
whoa 
what if you just took them
for a little while 
until i can figure something out 
i ll pay for food 
i get an employee discount 
it s the least i can do 
georgia  i m sorry  but i can t stand here
all day playing fetch with you 
georgia  zip it 
no 
guys  come on  please  oh  no 
what s it gonna take for me
to get you guys to   
sweet ride 
yeah  it s pretty much a chick magnet 
i m not gonna lie to you 
getting close  right there  that s it 
this is where you live 
actually  my parents are out of town 
so i kind of had to make
other arrangements 
this place looks condemned 
what are we doing here 
it s where we keep the dogs 
  well  are you allowed to be in there 
  no  so let s move it 
all right  guys  watch this 
ready 
are you sure it s safe in here 
yeah  we ve been poking around here
for a couple of days  actually 
okay  that hurt 
hold your fire  hold your fire 
bruce  you remember dave  right 
dave from the pet store 
hi  dave 
he just needed a place
to keep a couple of dogs
and i thought  you know 
 hey  we have a place   
so you made this 
yeah  it s a work in progress 
and how did you learn
how to make that 
my dad 
wouldn t it be easier
just to throw it  though 
yeah  but that s not really the point 
the point is when i get it working 
she should be able to play fetch
even when we re not here 
can you give me free pay per view 
oh  poop 
literally 
what is going on here 
i mean  who poops on the floor 
  sorry  i need to work on that 
  how did you find us 
i followed the van
with the ears and the tail 
you re not gonna tell anyone  are you 
why would i tell 
i m gonna help you guys 
  really 
  yeah 
i love dogs  and there s a lot more
to taking care of them
than throwing a stick and feeding them 
you guys need me 
i say she s in 
okay  i mean 
how much trouble can they be 
come on  guys 
do you really think we can do this 
like  every day

  oh  so you think this is funny 
  no  no  not at all

for reminding me to watch where i   
   step 
you know  i think we might
be in a little over our heads 
it s 4 6  we re outdogged 
guys  it s really not that bad 
i mean  if you look at it 
dogs have three basic needs 
that s eating  sleeping
and then peeing and pooping 
  that s four 
  no  i think peeing and pooping s one 
i ve stepped in both 
and i d have to disagree 
look  guys  i m serious 
i really think i can make this work 
how
