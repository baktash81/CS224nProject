this great city of ours 
that word was all but meaningless 
an ideal as elusive as a dream 
now  200 years later 
we are  all of us  living proof
that peace is indeed attainable 
the reason for this is 
of course  our faction system 
erudite  dauntless 
amity  candor  abnegation 
in dividing people according
to personality and aptitude 
we ve created a society in which
each faction plays a critical role
in maintaining the social order 
but this harmony we ve achieved
is now under attack
from a small but extremely
dangerous group of individuals
we call them  divergents  
they are  in essence  the worst
of what humanity used to be 
rebellious  defiant  and uncontrollable 
five days ago 
a rogue group of divergents
posing as dauntless brutally
invaded abnegation 
an obvious attempt
to cripple the faction system
by attacking its
most vulnerable members 
these divergents despise our system because
they are incapable of conforming to it 
these latest rumours 
for example 
that i was somehow behind the
attack on abnegation 
nothing more than divergent propaganda 
i am devoting myself to bringing
these fugitives to justice 
i ve exercised my right as acting
council leader to declare martial law
until i m confident that any threat
to our security has been eliminated 
tell jeanine we got it 
we are all that is left of humanity 
the vast wall that encloses this city
may protect us from our toxic surroundings 
but it is up to us to confront any element
that could poison us from within 
because when you are
civilization s last hope 
peace is not merely an ideal 
it is an obligation 
and it is up to all us to take a stand
against its one true enemy 
divergents 
 labored panting 
 crows cawing loudly 
amity 
we need to make sure it s clear 
tris 
help us  please  help us  please 
please  help us  you have to help us 
sorry  you have to leave 
  you just don t belong here 
  it s all her fault 
you killed will 
no   
 crowd whispers  repeatedly  she killed   
mom 
you ve killed us all 
will 
  and    three 
  higher 
hey 
  higher  higher 
  you want to go higher 
  alright  everyone 
back to class  let s go 
  okay  here we go 
see you 
i just wanted to do something different 
yeah 
well  that s definitely different 
  you don t like it 
  no  i like it  i like it a lot 
i m just surprised  that s all 
  what s going on  tris 
  nothing  i m fine 
just   
still having nightmares 
no 
we re good 
you and me 
i know nothing else
is  but we are 
time for chores 
how much longer do we
have to stay here  four 
until we know it s safe to leave 
  hey 
  hey 
son 
you can t ignore me forever 
i know you re thinking
about your next move 
but there are things
you don t know 
marcus  please just leave us alone 
your mother didn t come back to
abnegation just to save you 
she died trying to hide
something from jeanine 
something that was entrusted
to abnegation
  a long time ago 
  marcus  stop 
whatever you want from us 
you re not going to get it 
i m not the enemy here 
you found it   
it was in the home of natalie
and andrew prior  like you said 
you mind telling me what s inside 
a message from the founders
that will ensure the future
our people deserve 
divergents will destroy our society 
unless we destroy them 
and now we can 
however  only a divergent
can open this box 
find them 
every last one of them 
go with happiness 
go with happiness 
  go with happiness 
  thank you 
go with happiness 
go with happiness 
i really don t know how much longer i
can do this whole peace and love thing 
it s the amity way  alright 
just try to blend in 
i m trying to blend in 
it s just not working 
coming through  on your right 
hey  here we go 
hey  look  a rainbow  it s pretty 
virtual pathological friendliness
with unquestioned pacifism 
i love this place 
thank you  go with happiness 
oops  excuse me 
hey  tris  i really like
your hair by the way 
did you try to cut it
all short and weird like that 
peter  why don t you take your food and sit down  huh 
or what 
besides  i think we all should all
stick together now that we re
all officially fugitives 
wait what do you mean
 officially fugitives  
ah  you don t know 
you didn t tell caleb 
yeah  so now jeanine is saying
that the attack on abnegation
was orchestrated by a group of
renegade divergents and their sympathizers 
  so they re blaming this
whole thing on us 
  yeah 
jeanine needed a reason
to petition to the
council to institute martial law 
now she has one 
staying here at amity is still
our best option for now 
we need to keep an ear to the ground 
find out where the rest of
the dauntless are   
then we can make a move 
we need to kill jeanine 
i know  we re not ready yet 
beatrice  you re not
being serious  right 
no  i am being serious   
i m not going to stop until she s dead 
tris  you can t just go
around killing people 
no  she s right  listen to your sister 
tris  i think you should go to erudite
and kill jeanine yourself 
i ll stay with caleb so
that you don t get him killed too 
what 
come on  you know 
like you did your parents 
stop 
what do you think you re doing 
  my office  now 
enjoy your meal  everyone  enjoy your meal 
calm down  just calm down  alright 
was i not clear that the
terms of your sanctuary
here included non violence 
well  i can guarantee you
nothing like this will ever
happen again 
well  be that as it may 
you can no longer stay here with us 
your presence is just too disruptive 
the truth is that our sanctuary was never
going to last very long here anyway   
was it 
with you not standing up to jeanine 
  you don t understand us at all 
  no  i do understand you 
i understand that you think you can
stay out of this  but you can t 
one day  she s going to show up
and jeanine is going to take
whatever power you think
you have away from you 
tris  tris 
look  johanna  we need a little more time 
i need to find out where the rest of
the dauntless are  then we can leave 
and then what  attack erudite 
  i will not be a party to violence 
  and no one is asking you to 
we just need a few more days 
one 
one  what 
one more chance 
see  to be amity
is to forgive others   
and yourself 
you re hurting  tris 
and my heart goes out to you 
i know what it s like to stand helpless
while you lose the ones you love 
but killing jeanine is not
going to bring your mother back 
i know you re angry  but
you re letting it consume you 
 persistent knocking  downstairs 
what is it 
stay here and keep quiet 
gentlemen  amity welcomes you 
to what do we
owe the pleasure 
this isn t really a
social call  johanna 
  we re looking for divergents 
  i see 
well  of course  anything
we can do to help 
we need you to volunteer
your faction to be tested 
  new screening technology from erudite 
  amity 
now that jeanine is heading up the council 
the approval process
just got a little easier 
  you re exceeding your jurisdiction 
  now  johanna 
what happened to that amity politeness 
the easy way or the hard way 
it s up to you 
alright  but under protest 
okay  we re good to go 
  move it out 
  round them up 
give it a go 
all amity report to the dome
for new mandatory testing 
please proceed to the dome
for mandatory testing 
in the building  let s go 
get inside  line up 
  let s go  move it 
  this way

oh  you stand like dauntless 
well  i have no idea what this one is 
  look  we just need to get
to the city  that s all 
  well  too bad  train s taken 
and you damaged our cargo 
these are abnegation fabric bolts
and you are factionless  right 
  caleb 
  i used to be abnegation 
we used to use those same bolts
to make clothes for you 
are you saying that
we re stealing from you 
no  no  i m no longer abnegation 
so technically you re not stealing from me 
but    no  you re not stealing at all 
it s    i mean   
maybe it s a question of
semantics  i suppose 
whether it s stealing or charity 
  but it s all really the same 
  that s enough 
everybody  relax  alright 
you ve made your point 
  we ll get off your train  alright 
  guys  would everybody just relax 
okay  why don t we  uh    take a seat 
caleb 
  i m sorry  i was just trying to help 
  don t 
oh  yeah  this is going
to be fun  isn t it 
everybody just calm down  alright 
caleb   
get off  get    off 
  you alright 
  yeah 
okay 
tobias eaton 
you say that again 
tobias eaton 
what  you know him 
i am him 
we have been looking for you 
what  what are they talking about 
four 
follow me 
tris  i m sorry  i wanted to help  i   
four  four  why are they looking for you 
how do they know your your name 
this is factionless 
this is insane 
tobias 
mother 
i thought she was dead 
me  too 
will someone please tell me
what s going on here 
tobias  father was very abusive 
i knew the only way i could ever
truly escape him would be to   
disappear completely 
abnegation helped me fake my death 
anything to protect marcus  image 
but you just left him there
alone with marcus 
i was very young 
i reached out to him about a year ago 
i felt it was finally time to reconnect 
  i m still your mother 
  no  my mother is dead 
i went to her funeral when i was six 
and she wasn t trying to reconnect with me 
she was trying to use me 
like you are now 
why 
she wants an army 
  an army 
  i want an alliance 
  no  what you want is revenge 
this isn t about me 
it s about putting an end to a system that
says one group is more
deserving than another 
this city may be surrounded by a wall 
but it doesn t have to be a prison 
i think that s a bit extreme 
i mean  the faction system isn t meant
to be perfect  but it s hardly a prison 
let me guess  erudite 
i was erudite 
  you willing to kill jeanine 
  absolutely 
when i was married to marcus 
i knew her well 
and believe me 
there s nothing she is incapable of 
  but i think you already know that 
  tris  we can t trust her 
  maybe she knows   
  we re on the same side  tris 
i m factionless because
i don t fit in any one faction 
and you re divergent because
you belong to too many   
but we are both a threat to jeanine 
my people are ready for war 
if that s what it takes 
and then what 
  we depose those in power 
  and once you ve done that 
once you ve killed jeanine 
who s in power then 
you see  that s the part that
she always conveniently leaves out 
don t you tell me this isn t about you 
this is only about you 
i know where the remaining
dauntless are hiding 
  where 
  they took shelter in candor 
as far as i know they re still there 
think about it  if we were
to combine forces 
dauntless and factionless 
we d be unstoppable 
that s not going to happen 
thank you for your hospitality 
but we will be leaving in the morning 
four  maybe this is   
tobias  please reconsider 
don t you call me that 
my name is four 
you want to tuck him in  or should i 
well    this    this meal looks lovely 
thank you 
i m sorry 
i should have told you about her 
no more secrets 
okay 
i m sorry  i didn t mean to wake you 
i always loved watching him sleep 
i take it you re setting out for
candor in the morning 
yeah 
listen  i only want what s best for him 
you hardly even know him 
you d like to think
that wouldn t you 
but deep down  i think you re
scared i know him all to well 
  i m not scared 
  of course you are 
you re scared he ll finally
see you for what you really are 
deadly 
you don t believe me 
ask him 
you okay 
yeah 
  you sure 
  yeah 
  i m not going with you guys 
  what 
to candor 
i m not going with you guys 
  what are you talking about 
  what s your plan 
you guys are going to find
the rest of the dauntless  then what 
you attack erudite 
assassinate jeanine  start a civil war 
i m sorry  i m just not cut out for that 
i m not like you guys 
i need to go back to abnegation  maybe   
sort out what our parents left behind   
at least i ll be useful there 
caleb  there s nothing left at abnegation 
yeah 
  you okay 
  we just need to get to candor 
tris 
i know you think caleb is
your responsibility 
but he made his own choice 
you can t protect everyone 
  i can t protect anyone 
  nobody can 
him leaving isn t your fault 
none of this is your fault 
johanna was right 
you have to forgive yourself 
thank you 
 loudspeaker  all factions have been instructed
to maintain a strict curfew until further notice  
  we ve got to move 
 repeat  all factions have been
instructed to maintain a strict
curfew until further notice  
  we found them 
  yeah 
four 
damn  is it good to see you guys 
  how are you  uriah 
  i m better now  i m not
exactly good for laying low 
  tris 
  christina 
  it s so good to see you 
  you too 
have you heard anything about will 
  no 
  nothing 
no 
something must have happened to him 
he would ve found me by now  you know 
  hey 
  hey 
how are you holding up 
  how many dauntless do we have 
  175 total 
  175  that s it 
  the rest followed max 
  not near the numbers we need 
  no   
hold it  drop your guns 
  woah  hey  they re with us 
  we know who you are 
last warning  drop your guns 
alright 
easy 
  i m jack kang  i m leadership here 
  yeah  we know who you are 
we are not a threat to candor 
that might be your truth 
it s not necessarily mine 
all i know for certain is 
you are both wanted for
criminal insurgency and conspiring
in the attack on abnegation 
those are lies 
if you were candor 
i would take you at your word 
unfortunately given the circumstances 
i m obliged to hand you over to the council 
you can make your case there 
you might as well just kill us now 
if jeanine finds us  we re not going to live to stand trial 
i doubt that very much 
she would never supercede the council 
you sure about that 
who s going to stop her  you 
factional law must be upheld 
no  wait  wait  wait 
can i ask you one question 
can i ask you one question 
jeanine believes that erudite are most fit
to govern because they are the smartest 
do you believe that candor is most fit
to judge because you are so honest 
i admit  i do hold that belief 
then  would you say that a trial
held here at candor
would be inherently more fair than
a trial held by erudite 
the answer is yes 
in my opinion  a candor trial
would have the greatest chance
of achieving true justice 
so you are asking me to petition a council
to grant candor sole judiciary power 
no  as part of candor s initiation 
you administer a truth serum   
correct 
we don t typically discuss such matters
out of faction 
  that s a pretty evasive answer 
  evasion is not dishonesty 
but it s not exactly honesty  either 
  yes  we possess such a serum 
  then use it on us 
four 
if we are guilty  we ll surrender
to the council  alright 
if not  you ve just saved two lives 
  and made some loyal allies 
  alright 
but you should know that
the serum can be quite brutal 
it was designed for candor applicants  who
are already predisposed to honesty 
not everyone finds it so easy
to share their secrets 
  i don t want to do this 
  we have to 
neither of us have secrets worth dying for 
may the truth set you free 
tobias eaton 
you are accused of conspiring
with your fellow dauntless
in the attack on abnegation 
is this true 
conspiring  no 
but i did attack 
i was in simulation controlled by jeanine
and the rest of the dauntless
that she recruited 
tris found me 
she managed to break me free
from the simulation and together  we   
together  fought our way out 
so you are saying that jeanine
orchestrated this attack 
yes 
one last thing 
if you suspected that
jeanine had corrupted dauntless 
why didn t you just leave 
why did you stay 
i wanted to leave 
but i fell in love with tris prior 
and i could not leave her 
thank you for your candor 
thank you for your candor 
tobias eaton  this trial
has concluded
and you are absolved of guilt
in the attack on abnegation 
miss prior  if you would 
may the truth set you free 
tris prior 
mr  eaton said you managed
to free him from the sim 
yes 
so you were never
under the simulation yourself 
no 
how is that possible 
because i m divergent 
 crowd gasps and whispers 
i see 
so you never harmed any of your fellow
dauntless or the abnegation 
i did 
who 
my mom 
um    i watched her die first
and then my dad 
they were killed
trying to save me 
and i   
miss prior  the more you resist 
the more painful the serum will be 
my friend    i killed my friend 
he was trying to shoot me  and i   
i shot him first 
what was his name 
i can t   
what was his name 
will 
i killed will 
this is what happens   
to people that get close to me 
they get hurt or they die 
i can t forgive myself 
thank you for your candor 
thank you for your candor 
tris 
tris 
i m sorry  alright 
  i told you that i didn t want to do that 
  i   
  christina 
  go 
go 
abnegation sim complete 
dauntless sim initiating 
ma am  the divergent s vitals are dropping 
if we don t pull her out of
the sim soon  we ll loose her 
you ll stop when i say so 
she s going to do it 
she s going to pass the sim 
dauntless sim failed 
divergent test subject six
is no longer viable 
alright  shut it down 
wasting our time   
i ve been assuming that all
divergents are the same 
but some are much stronger than others 
assign all non essential personnel
to the divergent detail 
we need to look harder 
we need to find that very special one 
where s your scary boyfriend 
probably off doing scary boyfriend things 
mind if i join you 
i love heights 
from up here  it all just seems
so much smaller  you know 
i know it sounds crazy  but   
sometimes i think i see lights   
out beyond the wall 
i know they say it s all just   
wasteland out there  but   
we can t be the only ones left 
can we 
 gunfire flares up 
let s go 
  closest weapons 
  rifle 
floor s clear  moving down 
  mommy  mommy 
  shh 
  shh 
  they hurt my mommy 
look  i got one too 
see  it s okay 
it s just the thing that
made everybody go to sleep 
okay  i need you
to do me a favor 
i need you to go to the top
of those stairs over there
and don t come down until
your mommy comes to get you 
  don t come down 
  don t come down  can you do that 
be brave  okay 
okay  go 
hey 
why are we the only ones awake 
because we re divergents 
come on  i need your help 
we have to open this 
uriah  i need your help 
hey 
look who decided to show up 
it s really good to see you again 
alright  folks 
nothing to be nervous about 
just a little routine inspection 
then we can all go back to our business 
hello 
divergent  10  
huh  shit 
you re almost normal 
that s boring 
that is not part of the mission 
so what 
as far as i m concerned 
the rest of them are still outlaws 
let s just wrap this up quickly 
the others are going to be awake soon 
  hi  sweetie 
  i should not   
  divergent  40  
  i m afraid it s not you either 
the lady said that i should not   
the lady said that i shouldn t
have come downstairs 
i guess you should have listened 
enough 
we still have to test her  eric 
jeanine told us that
we have to test everyone 
  divergent 100  
  i ll be damned 
  what 
  she s what we ve been looking for 
bullshit 
divergent 100  
get her in the vehicle 
i ll alert jeanine 
if you think you got lucky  you are wrong 
you re going to wish i killed you 
drop your weapons 
right there 
down where i can see them 
hey 
thank you 
it s lucky you got that gun  four 
we both know you re never much without one 
you think she s safe now 
you re wrong 
jeanine s never going to stop
searching for you 
why 
what does she want with her  tell me 
look  all i know is she s
exactly what jeanine needs 
she s the perfect subject 
was that supposed to scare me 
you re responsible for the
death of hundreds of people 
you know the
punishment for that 
listen    i found a way to live
with the blood on my hands 
but can you 
why won t they come out 
all i know is it put me in
a sleeping sim and then i woke up
to all hell breaking loose 
hack  don t play with it 
you all know what this means 
thank you 
  for helping us 
  i wish i could do more 
i had no idea jeanine was capable
of something like this 
it s time we fight back 
  we don t have the numbers 
  we will 
once we get to factionless 
you heard eric 
jeanine is never going to stop
coming after you 
it s our only option 
tris prior  of course 
it had to be her 
  is she still off the grid 
  yeah 
yeah  but i think i found a solution 
  it s peter  right 
  yeah 
and  jeanine  can i just say it is truly
an honor to finally meet you in person 
congratulations  mother 
you got your war 
  i know you wish there was another way 
  but there isn t 
i m the lesser of two evils  is that it 
  you d better be 
  tell me   
why did you surrender to erudite 
what do you want 
i would like a position in your regime 
ideally  i would like a position with
some advancement opportunities 
i may be dauntless 
but i m not just some meathead 
no offense  max 
prove your worth to us 
then we can discuss your ambitions 
great 
when do i start 
let s talk about your friend  tris prior 
  how do i flush her out 
  it s simple 
the girl is a walking bleeding heart 
she was born abnegation 
that s her weak spot 
you just have to know
how to press it 
  help  come quick 
  it s coming from up there 
christina  please  help 
somebody  do something 
  look  on the ledge 
  what are they doing 
the traitor  tris prior 
must be surrendered to erudite 
or every day more death will follow 
  go 
  hand over tris prior 
or every day more death will follow 
hand over tris prior 
  or every day more death will follow 
  get them down 
hunter  no 
hand over tris prior 
  or every day more death will follow 
  christina 
no 
christina    christina 
tris  help me 
tris 
we removed this from
the body of the suicide 
marlene  her name was marlene 
i m sorry  marlene 
it s a very sophisticated
sim serum injector 
it also has a radio transmitter
in its head 
  how do we get them out 
  i don t know 
this tech was built to defend itself 
this tendril   
wraps around the nearest major artery 
try to remove them and   
they kill the host 
 indistinct  worried chatter 
  that s insane 
  so what do we do 
tori has to find a way to neutralize the
disks before we do anything else 
or we could do the logical thing 
and we hand her over 
nobody knows about this alliance 
we have to protect that advantage 
if we hand tris over now 
it might buy us some time 
 the factionless
raise their voices in agreement 
  i think it s a good idea 
  get rid of her 
damn right 
except you ll have to go through me first 
  me too 
  and all of us 
 the dauntless rally behind four 
hey  hey  i ain t the one with
the time bomb in my arm 
  yeah  kick them out 
  you ve got to go 
i know what you re thinking   
but i m not going to let you do it 
i can t let anyone else die because of me 
no one else is going to die because of you 
tori s going to find a way to
disable the disks 
  and if she doesn t 
  then   
then if she doesn t  we figure it out 
together 
you know  i m just one person 
  i m not worth it 
  you are worth it 
you are more than worth it to me 
i love you 
 jeanine via loudspeaker 
    maintaining the social order 
but this harmony we ve achieved is now under attack  
 this city may be safely enclosed behind
a vast wall  but make no mistake 
that wall alone does not ensure our security  
 it s up to us  every one of us 
to remain vigilant in identifying and isolating
any potential threat to our stability  
 there are individuals hiding among
us who must be contained  
 so permit me to address the objections from
my fellow faction leaders   
 i am aware that there have been some
concerns about the unavoidable raid on candor  
 so let me be clear  
 the harbouring of divergents
by any faction 
 can not be tolerated  
 very soon  i will be presenting
what i believe to be 
 no less than a mandate from
the founders themselves  
 and this will  i have no doubt 
validate the measures
i am taking to keep the peace 
 and provide the instructions that
will allow us to eradicate
the divergent crisis  
 once and for all  
where are you going 
tris left  she s gone 
what  when 
  last night 
  wait 
tobias  people look to you for leadership 
you can t just abandon them 
tobias 
wow 
i have to admit  i m impressed 
i mean  i knew that you were dumb  but   
i didn t think you were dumb enough
to actually come down here   
and turn yourself in 
the killings have to stop 
well  that just shows that you can
take the girl out of abnegation
but you can t take the abnegation
out of the girl 
let s go 
once a stiff  always a stiff  right 
  what is this 
  what is this  this is the only
reason why you re alive  tris 
man  i love knowing stuff
that you don t 
i need you to open up that box  tris 
the only way to open that box is to
pass the sims of all five factions 
but the only people that have
tried to do it so far have died 
oops  i don t think
i was supposed to tell you that 
oh well   
no pressure 
remarkable 
the chances of it being you  of all people 
nearly defies the laws of probability 
as remarkable as the amount of people
you ve managed to murder 
dark times call for extreme measures 
you may find it hard to believe 
but i am serving the greater good 
step up on the disk  please 
 peter cocks his gun 
step up on the disk  please 
ma am 
hmm 
oh 
stop the suicides or i
swear i will shoot him 
that s okay  you can kill him if you want 
we have plenty of guards 
what 
i m guessing you need me alive
for this to work  right 
right 
beatrice 
caleb 
caleb 
don t engage the subject 
conditions are already less then optimal 
oh  my god 
if i do this  the suicides stop 
no 
the suicides will continue 
until you succeed and pass all five sims 
that should be incentive enough 
good luck 
let s begin 
initializing dauntless sim 
mom 
tris  help me 
mom 
  tris 
  mom 
her heart rate is rising 
keep her in play 
mom 
  tris 
  i m coming 
mom 
i m coming 
tris  help me 
hold on 
tris 
dauntless sim complete 
mom 
i miss you so much 
i know you do 
but i m still with you 
you need to be strong now 
tell me you re going to be strong 
  i m trying 
  you can do this 
i know you can 
you re brave 
braver than anyone 
i m not brave  mom 
i pretend that i am 
and i want people to think
that i am  but i m not 
i m really  really scared 
that maybe we are actually what s
wrong in this world 
divergents 
i never wanted any of this 
you  and dad  and caleb  and then four 
i can t help but think that
if i was normal  we would
all still be together 
mom  i don t want to be divergent anymore 
i just want to feel safe again 
candor sim complete 
four  you re here 
  yeah  yeah 
  you re here 
  are you okay 
  yeah 
secure the hallway 
okay  let s get you out of here 
  you good 
  yeah 
stop  let him go 
wait  you re not going to shoot me 
once a stiff  always a stiff 
go 
four  how did you get past security 
you know me  scary boyfriend skills 
what is it 
you weren t there 
you didn t even hear that 
tris  we need to leave now 
alright 
i m sorry  four 
  what 
  i m sorry i didn t tell you
that i was going to go 
i wanted to say goodbye 
and i just didn t know how 
i didn t know how 
what are you talking about 
so even though i didn t get to
say it in real life 
at least i get to say it now 
  even if it is just in a sim 
  tris  we re not in a sim 
don t you think i would
know if i was in a sim 
four    you re not in a sim 
  you are the sim 
  wait  wait 
erudite sim complete 
there s only amity now 
she hasn t passed
abnegation yet 
yes  she has  when she spared your life 
this girl is extraordinary 
she s tested positive for
four factions in one day 
no one has gotten that far 
we ve got a problem 
she s crashing  we have to rest her 
sure you re not letting familial
attachment cloud your judgement 
see for yourself 
very well 
detach the subject 
good work  everyone 
we will resume tomorrow 
you were never planing on going
back to abnegation  were you 
i had to do what i thought was right 
our parents would be ashamed of you 
well maybe not 
i mean  i am willing
to sacrifice you 
the only family i have left 
the only person i love 
in order to preserve what s
best for everyone else 
what s more selfless than that 
what does jeanine think
is in that box  caleb 
it s a message from the founders 
but the box was to be opened
only if the faction system broke down 
which is why it requires
someone like you to open it 
you are living proof
that the divergent problem
has grown beyond all control 
do you even hear what you
are saying right now 
no one thinks it s your fault
that you were born this way 
jeanine murdered
an entire faction  caleb 
that faction could no longer be trusted 
she killed our parents 
our parents brought that on themselves 
what are you talking about 
the box  it was in their house 
they were the ones hiding it 
all those lives could have been spared 
seems we didn t knew our parents
as well as we thought we did 
alright  family reunion is over 
it s time to go 
i got a little surprise for you  tris 
  four 
  tris 
  tris 
  four  four 
  tris 
  four  four 
four  four 
i gather your brother explained to you
how vital the work you re doing here is
to the future of the city 
please  just let four go 
if his well being is of such
concern  then you should focus
on the task at hand 
tell me    do you appreciate irony 
you tested positive for erudite 
so you must have the
intellectual capacity 
irony 
for instance  right now you are
filled with hate 
 but you need to pass an amity sim 
then there are other ironies at work too 
  such as the fact your cherished mother   
  don t 
who you so dauntlessly saved in the sim
is the reason you re in
this mess to begin with 
you are the reason i m in this mess 
  and then there the most
poignant irony of all   
  stop 
that nathalie prior not only died
trying to protect the data
  that i now have in my possession 
  because you stole it from her 
you killed her for it 
data that she so
selfishly withheld 
but her own daughter 
her beloved divergent  tris 
is going to be the one
to deliver it to me 
  i said stop 
  therefore   
your mother s death  just like
your boyfriend s death    
will mean absolutely nothing 
don t pull her out  not yet 
no  no 
bring her back 
bring    bring her back 
now 
bring her back 
come on 
come on  come on 
bring her back 
test subject seven
is no longer viable 
i really thought you were the one 
we ll just   
we ll just have to resume our search 
find solace in your faction  caleb 
we are your family now 
jeanine wanted me to show you this 
hey  four  maybe do that thing you do 
hey  four  come on 
that was pretty good  right 
first  i swiped a paralytic
from the infirmary 
then i shot her up when she was
all freaking out about you 
i mean  i told these guys
i was pretty smart 
guess they should have listened 
  you re real 
  yeah  i m real 
what are you doing here 
you die  i die 
oh    okay  guys  come on 
let s go  seriously 
we can    do that later

alright  come on  let s go 
  before jeanine realizes
you re still alive 
  no  no  no 
  what 
  the box  we have to get the box 
are you kidding me 
now is not the time for
a souvenir  tris 
four  you have to listen to me 
it s not what jeanine thinks it is 
i know it s not 
my mother would have destroyed it 
we have to get it 
peter  is there another way into the lab 
i mean  i d have into go
into the control room to
disable all the doors 
okay  good 
then do that 
  okay  right now 
  yeah 
you just chose our side 
whether you meant to or not 
if you want to survive  make sure we do 
let s go 
fuck 
no guns  it ll draw too much attention 
  hey 
  hold up 
  access denied

i know it doesn t make any sense
but you have to trust me  please

that s enough 
no one s going to love you  tris 
they re never even going to miss you 
this world will be
better off without you 
one less divergent ruining everything 
and no one will ever  ever
forgive you for what you ve done 
you re wrong 
because i will 
amity sim complete 
  wait 
  no  stop 
initializing message 
hello 
i come from outside the wall 
where we have all but destroyed each other 
we designed your city
as an experiment 
we believe it is the only way
to recover the humanity
we have lost 
and we created factions to ensure peace 
but we believe there will be
those among you who
will transcend these factions 
these will be the divergent 
they are the true purpose
of this experiment 
they are vital to humanity s survival 
if you re watching this now 
then at least one of you is proof
that our experiment
has succeeded 
the time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us 
we have allowed you to believe
that you re the last of us 
but you re not 
mankind waits for you  with hope 
beyond the wall 
you okay 
yeah 
yes 
you were wrong about us 
we were never the problem 
we re the solution 
  bury the box 
  what 
no one sees it 
ever 
kill them both 
no 
don t move 
down 
put your weapons down now 
stay 
  put it down 
  do not move 
hello  jeanine 
evelyn 
impressive 
i think we re going to like it here 
do you honestly think the other
factions will stand for this 
because you re so popular 
get her out of here 
when that message gets out 
it will be the end 
what message 
you ll see 
i m going to put it on
every monitor in the city 
 founder via loudspeaker 
we have separated you
from the rest of us  
 and we created factions to ensure peace  
 the time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us  
 we have allowed you to believe
that you re the last of us  
 but you re not  
 if you re watching this now 
then at least one of you is proof 
 that our experiment
has succeeded  
 mankind waits for you 
with hope  
 beyond the wall  
these will be the divergent 
they are the true purpose
of this experiment 
they are vital
to humanity s survival 
you did it 
yeah 
everyone s staring at me 
you changed everything 
what now
