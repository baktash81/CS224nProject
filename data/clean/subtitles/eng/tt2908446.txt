this great city of ours
that word was all but meaningless
an ideal as elusive as a dream
now 200 years later
we are all of us living proof
that peace is indeed attainable
the reason for this is
of course our faction system
erudite dauntless
amity candor abnegation
in dividing people according
to personality and aptitude
weve created a society in which
each faction plays a critical role
in maintaining the social order
but this harmony weve achieved
is now under attack
from a small but extremely
dangerous group of individuals
we call them divergents
they are in essence the worst
of what humanity used to be
rebellious defiant and uncontrollable
five days ago
a rogue group of divergents
posing as dauntless brutally
invaded abnegation
an obvious attempt
to cripple the faction system
by attacking its
most vulnerable members
these divergents despise our system because
they are incapable of conforming to it
these latest rumours
for example
that i was somehow behind the
attack on abnegation
nothing more than divergent propaganda
i am devoting myself to bringing
these fugitives to justice
ive exercised my right as acting
council leader to declare martial law
until im confident that any threat
to our security has been eliminated
tell jeanine we got it
we are all that is left of humanity
the vast wall that encloses this city
may protect us from our toxic surroundings
but it is up to us to confront any element
that could poison us from within
because when you are
civilizations last hope
peace is not merely an ideal
it is an obligation
and it is up to all us to take a stand
against its one true enemy
divergents
labored panting
crows cawing loudly
amity
we need to make sure its clear
tris
help us please help us please
please help us you have to help us
sorry you have to leave
you just dont belong here
its all her fault
you killed will
no
crowd whispers repeatedly she killed
mom
youve killed us all
will
and three
higher
hey
higher higher
you want to go higher
alright everyone
back to class lets go
okay here we go
see you
i just wanted to do something different
yeah
well thats definitely different
you dont like it
no i like it i like it a lot
im just surprised thats all
whats going on tris
nothing im fine
just
still having nightmares
no
were good
you and me
i know nothing else
is but we are
time for chores
how much longer do we
have to stay here four
until we know its safe to leave
hey
hey
son
you cant ignore me forever
i know youre thinking
about your next move
but there are things
you dont know
marcus please just leave us alone
your mother didnt come back to
abnegation just to save you
she died trying to hide
something from jeanine
something that was entrusted
to abnegation
a long time ago
marcus stop
whatever you want from us
youre not going to get it
im not the enemy here
you found it
it was in the home of natalie
and andrew prior like you said
you mind telling me whats inside
a message from the founders
that will ensure the future
our people deserve
divergents will destroy our society
unless we destroy them
and now we can
however only a divergent
can open this box
find them
every last one of them
go with happiness
go with happiness
go with happiness
thank you
go with happiness
go with happiness
i really dont know how much longer i
can do this whole peace and love thing
its the amity way alright
just try to blend in
im trying to blend in
its just not working
coming through on your right
hey here we go
hey look a rainbow its pretty
virtual pathological friendliness
with unquestioned pacifism
i love this place
thank you go with happiness
oops excuse me
hey tris i really like
your hair by the way
did you try to cut it
all short and weird like that
peter why dont you take your food and sit down huh
or what
besides i think we all should all
stick together now that were
all officially fugitives
wait what do you mean
officially fugitives
ah you dont know
you didnt tell caleb
yeah so now jeanine is saying
that the attack on abnegation
was orchestrated by a group of
renegade divergents and their sympathizers
so theyre blaming this
whole thing on us
yeah
jeanine needed a reason
to petition to the
council to institute martial law
now she has one
staying here at amity is still
our best option for now
we need to keep an ear to the ground
find out where the rest of
the dauntless are
then we can make a move
we need to kill jeanine
i know were not ready yet
beatrice youre not
being serious right
no i am being serious
im not going to stop until shes dead
tris you cant just go
around killing people
no shes right listen to your sister
tris i think you should go to erudite
and kill jeanine yourself
ill stay with caleb so
that you dont get him killed too
what
come on you know
like you did your parents
stop
what do you think youre doing
my office now
enjoy your meal everyone enjoy your meal
calm down just calm down alright
was i not clear that the
terms of your sanctuary
here included non violence
well i can guarantee you
nothing like this will ever
happen again
well be that as it may
you can no longer stay here with us
your presence is just too disruptive
the truth is that our sanctuary was never
going to last very long here anyway
was it
with you not standing up to jeanine
you dont understand us at all
no i do understand you
i understand that you think you can
stay out of this but you cant
one day shes going to show up
and jeanine is going to take
whatever power you think
you have away from you
tris tris
look johanna we need a little more time
i need to find out where the rest of
the dauntless are then we can leave
and then what attack erudite
i will not be a party to violence
and no one is asking you to
we just need a few more days
one
one what
one more chance
see to be amity
is to forgive others
and yourself
youre hurting tris
and my heart goes out to you
i know what its like to stand helpless
while you lose the ones you love
but killing jeanine is not
going to bring your mother back
i know youre angry but
youre letting it consume you
persistent knocking downstairs
what is it
stay here and keep quiet
gentlemen amity welcomes you
to what do we
owe the pleasure
this isnt really a
social call johanna
were looking for divergents
i see
well of course anything
we can do to help
we need you to volunteer
your faction to be tested
new screening technology from erudite
amity
now that jeanine is heading up the council
the approval process
just got a little easier
youre exceeding your jurisdiction
now johanna
what happened to that amity politeness
the easy way or the hard way
its up to you
alright but under protest
okay were good to go
move it out
round them up
give it a go
all amity report to the dome
for new mandatory testing
please proceed to the dome
for mandatory testing
in the building lets go

caleb

caleb

oh you folks sure know
how to make an entrance
factionless
amity
oh you stand like dauntless
well i have no idea what this one is
look we just need to get
to the city thats all
well too bad trains taken
and you damaged our cargo
these are abnegation fabric bolts
and you are factionless right
caleb
i used to be abnegation
we used to use those same bolts
to make clothes for you
are you saying that
were stealing from you
no no im no longer abnegation
so technically youre not stealing from me
but no youre not stealing at all
its i mean
maybe its a question of
semantics i suppose
whether its stealing or charity
but its all really the same
thats enough
everybody relax alright
youve made your point
well get off your train alright
guys would everybody just relax
okay why dont we uh take a seat
caleb
im sorry i was just trying to help
dont
oh yeah this is going
to be fun isnt it
everybody just calm down alright
caleb
get off get off
you alright
yeah
okay
tobias eaton
you say that again
tobias eaton
what you know him
i am him
we have been looking for you
what what are they talking about
four
follow me
tris im sorry i wanted to help i
four four why are they looking for you
how do they know your your name
this is factionless
this is insane
tobias
mother
i thought she was dead
me too
will someone please tell me
whats going on here
tobias father was very abusive
i knew the only way i could ever
truly escape him would be to
disappear completely
abnegation helped me fake my death
anything to protect marcus image
but you just left him there
alone with marcus
i was very young
i reached out to him about a year ago
i felt it was finally time to reconnect
im still your mother
no my mother is dead
i went to her funeral when i was six
and she wasnt trying to reconnect with me
she was trying to use me
like you are now
why
she wants an army
an army
i want an alliance
no what you want is revenge
this isnt about me
its about putting an end to a system that
says one group is more
deserving than another
this city may be surrounded by a wall
but it doesnt have to be a prison
i think thats a bit extreme
i mean the faction system isnt meant
to be perfect but its hardly a prison
let me guess erudite
i was erudite
you willing to kill jeanine
absolutely
when i was married to marcus
i knew her well
and believe me
theres nothing she is incapable of
but i think you already know that
tris we cant trust her
maybe she knows
were on the same side tris
im factionless because
i dont fit in any one faction
and youre divergent because
you belong to too many
but we are both a threat to jeanine
my people are ready for war
if thats what it takes
and then what
we depose those in power
and once youve done that
once youve killed jeanine
whos in power then
you see thats the part that
she always conveniently leaves out
dont you tell me this isnt about you
this is only about you
i know where the remaining
dauntless are hiding
where
they took shelter in candor
as far as i know theyre still there
think about it if we were
to combine forces
dauntless and factionless
wed be unstoppable
thats not going to happen
thank you for your hospitality
but we will be leaving in the morning
four maybe this is
tobias please reconsider
dont you call me that
my name is four
you want to tuck him in or should i
well this this meal looks lovely
thank you
im sorry
i should have told you about her
no more secrets
okay
im sorry i didnt mean to wake you
i always loved watching him sleep
i take it youre setting out for
candor in the morning
yeah
listen i only want whats best for him
you hardly even know him
youd like to think
that wouldnt you
but deep down i think youre
scared i know him all to well
im not scared
of course you are
youre scared hell finally
see you for what you really are
deadly
you dont believe me
ask him
you okay
yeah
you sure
yeah
im not going with you guys
what
to candor
im not going with you guys
what are you talking about
whats your plan
you guys are going to find
the rest of the dauntless then what
you attack erudite
assassinate jeanine start a civil war
im sorry im just not cut out for that
im not like you guys
i need to go back to abnegation maybe
sort out what our parents left behind
at least ill be useful there
caleb theres nothing left at abnegation
yeah
you okay
we just need to get to candor
tris
i know you think caleb is
your responsibility
but he made his own choice
you cant protect everyone
i cant protect anyone
nobody can
him leaving isnt your fault
none of this is your fault
johanna was right
you have to forgive yourself
thank you
loudspeaker all factions have been instructed
to maintain a strict curfew until further notice
weve got to move
repeat all factions have been
instructed to maintain a strict
curfew until further notice
we found them
yeah
four
damn is it good to see you guys
how are you uriah
im better now im not
exactly good for laying low
tris
christina
its so good to see you
you too
have you heard anything about will
no
nothing
no
something must have happened to him
he wouldve found me by now you know
hey
hey
how are you holding up
how many dauntless do we have
175 total
175 thats it
the rest followed max
not near the numbers we need
no
hold it drop your guns
woah hey theyre with us
we know who you are
last warning drop your guns
alright
easy
im jack kang im leadership here
yeah we know who you are
we are not a threat to candor
that might be your truth
its not necessarily mine
all i know for certain is
you are both wanted for
criminal insurgency and conspiring
in the attack on abnegation
those are lies
if you were candor
i would take you at your word
unfortunately given the circumstances
im obliged to hand you over to the council
you can make your case there
you might as well just kill us now
if jeanine finds us were not going to live to stand trial
i doubt that very much
she would never supercede the council
you sure about that
whos going to stop her you
factional law must be upheld
no wait wait wait
can i ask you one question
can i ask you one question
jeanine believes that erudite are most fit
to govern because they are the smartest
do you believe that candor is most fit
to judge because you are so honest
i admit i do hold that belief
then would you say that a trial
held here at candor
would be inherently more fair than
a trial held by erudite
the answer is yes
in my opinion a candor trial
would have the greatest chance
of achieving true justice
so you are asking me to petition a council
to grant candor sole judiciary power
no as part of candors initiation
you administer a truth serum
correct
we dont typically discuss such matters
out of faction
thats a pretty evasive answer
evasion is not dishonesty
but its not exactly honesty either
yes we possess such a serum
then use it on us
four
if we are guilty well surrender
to the council alright
if not youve just saved two lives
and made some loyal allies
alright
but you should know that
the serum can be quite brutal
it was designed for candor applicants who
are already predisposed to honesty
not everyone finds it so easy
to share their secrets
i dont want to do this
we have to
neither of us have secrets worth dying for
may the truth set you free
tobias eaton
you are accused of conspiring
with your fellow dauntless
in the attack on abnegation
is this true
conspiring no
but i did attack
i was in simulation controlled by jeanine
and the rest of the dauntless
that she recruited
tris found me
she managed to break me free
from the simulation and together we
together fought our way out
so you are saying that jeanine
orchestrated this attack
yes
one last thing
if you suspected that
jeanine had corrupted dauntless
why didnt you just leave
why did you stay
i wanted to leave
but i fell in love with tris prior
and i could not leave her
thank you for your candor
thank you for your candor
tobias eaton this trial
has concluded
and you are absolved of guilt
in the attack on abnegation
miss prior if you would
may the truth set you free
tris prior
mr eaton said you managed
to free him from the sim
yes
so you were never
under the simulation yourself
no
how is that possible
because im divergent
crowd gasps and whispers
i see
so you never harmed any of your fellow
dauntless or the abnegation
i did
who
my mom
um i watched her die first
and then my dad
they were killed
trying to save me
and i
miss prior the more you resist
the more painful the serum will be
my friend i killed my friend
he was trying to shoot me and i
i shot him first
what was his name
i cant
what was his name
will
i killed will
this is what happens
to people that get close to me
they get hurt or they die
i cant forgive myself
thank you for your candor
thank you for your candor
tris
tris
im sorry alright
i told you that i didnt want to do that
i
christina
go
go
abnegation sim complete
dauntless sim initiating
maam the divergents vitals are dropping
if we dont pull her out of
the sim soon well loose her
youll stop when i say so
shes going to do it
shes going to pass the sim
dauntless sim failed
divergent test subject six
is no longer viable
alright shut it down
wasting our time
ive been assuming that all
divergents are the same
but some are much stronger than others
assign all nonessential personnel
to the divergent detail
we need to look harder
we need to find that very special one
wheres your scary boyfriend
probably off doing scary boyfriend things
mind if i join you
i love heights
from up here it all just seems
so much smaller you know
i know it sounds crazy but
sometimes i think i see lights
out beyond the wall
i know they say its all just
wasteland out there but
we cant be the only ones left
can we
gunfire flares up
lets go
closest weapons
rifle
floors clear moving down
mommy mommy
shh
shh
they hurt my mommy
look i got one too
see its okay
its just the thing that
made everybody go to sleep
okay i need you
to do me a favor
i need you to go to the top
of those stairs over there
and dont come down until
your mommy comes to get you
dont come down
dont come down can you do that
be brave okay
okay go
hey
why are we the only ones awake
because were divergents
come on i need your help
we have to open this
uriah i need your help
hey
look who decided to show up
its really good to see you again
alright folks
nothing to be nervous about
just a little routine inspection
then we can all go back to our business
hello
divergent 10
huh shit
youre almost normal
thats boring
that is not part of the mission
so what
as far as im concerned
the rest of them are still outlaws
lets just wrap this up quickly
the others are going to be awake soon
hi sweetie
i should not
divergent 40
im afraid its not you either
the lady said that i should not
the lady said that i shouldnt
have come downstairs
i guess you should have listened
enough
we still have to test her eric
jeanine told us that
we have to test everyone
divergent 100
ill be damned
what
shes what weve been looking for
bullshit
divergent 100
get her in the vehicle
ill alert jeanine
if you think you got lucky you are wrong
youre going to wish i killed you
drop your weapons
right there
down where i can see them
hey
thank you
its lucky you got that gun four
we both know youre never much without one
you think shes safe now
youre wrong
jeanines never going to stop
searching for you
why
what does she want with her tell me
look all i know is shes
exactly what jeanine needs
shes the perfect subject
was that supposed to scare me
youre responsible for the
death of hundreds of people
you know the
punishment for that
listen i found a way to live
with the blood on my hands
but can you
why wont they come out
all i know is it put me in
a sleeping sim and then i woke up
to all hell breaking loose
hack dont play with it
you all know what this means
thank you
for helping us
i wish i could do more
i had no idea jeanine was capable
of something like this
its time we fight back
we dont have the numbers
we will
once we get to factionless
you heard eric
jeanine is never going to stop
coming after you
its our only option
tris prior of course
it had to be her
is she still off the grid
yeah
yeah but i think i found a solution
its peter right
yeah
and jeanine can i just say it is truly
an honor to finally meet you in person
congratulations mother
you got your war
i know you wish there was another way
but there isnt
im the lesser of two evils is that it
youd better be
tell me
why did you surrender to erudite
what do you want
i would like a position in your regime
ideally i would like a position with
some advancement opportunities
i may be dauntless
but im not just some meathead
no offense max
prove your worth to us
then we can discuss your ambitions
great
when do i start
lets talk about your friend tris prior
how do i flush her out
its simple
the girl is a walking bleeding heart
she was born abnegation
thats her weak spot
you just have to know
how to press it
help come quick
its coming from up there
christina please help
somebody do something
look on the ledge
what are they doing
the traitor tris prior
must be surrendered to erudite
or every day more death will follow
go
hand over tris prior
or every day more death will follow
hand over tris prior
or every day more death will follow
get them down
hunter no
hand over tris prior
or every day more death will follow
christina
no
christina christina
tris help me
tris
we removed this from
the body of the suicide
marlene her name was marlene
im sorry marlene
its a very sophisticated
sim serum injector
it also has a radio transmitter
in its head
how do we get them out
i dont know
this tech was built to defend itself
this tendril
wraps around the nearest major artery
try to remove them and
they kill the host
indistinct worried chatter
thats insane
so what do we do
tori has to find a way to neutralize the
disks before we do anything else
or we could do the logical thing
and we hand her over
nobody knows about this alliance
we have to protect that advantage
if we hand tris over now
it might buy us some time
the factionless
raise their voices in agreement
i think its a good idea
get rid of her
damn right
except youll have to go through me first
me too
and all of us
the dauntless rally behind four
hey hey i aint the one with
the time bomb in my arm
yeah kick them out
youve got to go
i know what youre thinking
but im not going to let you do it
i cant let anyone else die because of me
no one else is going to die because of you
toris going to find a way to
disable the disks
and if she doesnt
then
then if she doesnt we figure it out
together
you know im just one person
im not worth it
you are worth it
you are more than worth it to me
i love you
jeanine via loudspeaker
maintaining the social order
but this harmony weve achieved is now under attack
this city may be safely enclosed behind
a vast wall but make no mistake
that wall alone does not ensure our security
its up to us every one of us
to remain vigilant in identifying and isolating
any potential threat to our stability
there are individuals hiding among
us who must be contained
so permit me to address the objections from
my fellow faction leaders
i am aware that there have been some
concerns about the unavoidable raid on candor
so let me be clear
the harbouring of divergents
by any faction
can not be tolerated
very soon i will be presenting
what i believe to be
no less than a mandate from
the founders themselves
and this will i have no doubt
validate the measures
i am taking to keep the peace
and provide the instructions that
will allow us to eradicate
the divergent crisis
once and for all
where are you going
tris left shes gone
what when
last night
wait
tobias people look to you for leadership
you cant just abandon them
tobias
wow
i have to admit im impressed
i mean i knew that you were dumb but
i didnt think you were dumb enough
to actually come down here
and turn yourself in
the killings have to stop
well that just shows that you can
take the girl out of abnegation
but you cant take the abnegation
out of the girl
lets go
once a stiff always a stiff right
what is this
what is this this is the only
reason why youre alive tris
man i love knowing stuff
that you dont
i need you to open up that box tris
the only way to open that box is to
pass the sims of all five factions
but the only people that have
tried to do it so far have died
oops i dont think
i was supposed to tell you that
oh well
no pressure
remarkable
the chances of it being you of all people
nearly defies the laws of probability
as remarkable as the amount of people
youve managed to murder
dark times call for extreme measures
you may find it hard to believe
but i am serving the greater good
step up on the disk please
peter cocks his gun
step up on the disk please
maam
hmm
oh
stop the suicides or i
swear i will shoot him
thats okay you can kill him if you want
we have plenty of guards
what
im guessing you need me alive
for this to work right
right
beatrice
caleb
caleb
dont engage the subject
conditions are already less then optimal
oh my god
if i do this the suicides stop
no
the suicides will continue
until you succeed and pass all five sims
that should be incentive enough
good luck
lets begin
initializing dauntless sim
mom
tris help me
mom
tris
mom
her heart rate is rising
keep her in play
mom
tris
im coming
mom
im coming
tris help me
hold on
tris
dauntless sim complete
mom
i miss you so much
i know you do
but im still with you
you need to be strong now
tell me youre going to be strong
im trying
you can do this
i know you can
youre brave
braver than anyone
im not brave mom
i pretend that i am
and i want people to think
that i am but im not
im really really scared
that maybe we are actually whats
wrong in this world
divergents
i never wanted any of this
you and dad and caleb and then four
i cant help but think that
if i was normal we would
all still be together
mom i dont want to be divergent anymore
i just want to feel safe again
candor sim complete
four youre here
yeah yeah
youre here
are you okay
yeah
secure the hallway
okay lets get you out of here
you good
yeah
stop let him go
wait youre not going to shoot me
once a stiff always a stiff
go
four how did you get past security
you know me scary boyfriend skills
what is it
you werent there
you didnt even hear that
tris we need to leave now
alright
im sorry four
what
im sorry i didnt tell you
that i was going to go
i wanted to say goodbye
and i just didnt know how
i didnt know how
what are you talking about
so even though i didnt get to
say it in real life
at least i get to say it now
even if it is just in a sim
tris were not in a sim
dont you think i would
know if i was in a sim
four youre not in a sim
you are the sim
wait wait
erudite sim complete
theres only amity now
she hasnt passed
abnegation yet
yes she has when she spared your life
this girl is extraordinary
shes tested positive for
four factions in one day
no one has gotten that far
weve got a problem
shes crashing we have to rest her
sure youre not letting familial
attachment cloud your judgement
see for yourself
very well
detach the subject
good work everyone
we will resume tomorrow
you were never planing on going
back to abnegation were you
i had to do what i thought was right
our parents would be ashamed of you
well maybe not
i mean i am willing
to sacrifice you
the only family i have left
the only person i love
in order to preserve whats
best for everyone else
whats more selfless than that
what does jeanine think
is in that box caleb
its a message from the founders
but the box was to be opened
only if the faction system broke down
which is why it requires
someone like you to open it
you are living proof
that the divergent problem
has grown beyond all control
do you even hear what you
are saying right now
no one thinks its your fault
that you were born this way
jeanine murdered
an entire faction caleb
that faction could no longer be trusted
she killed our parents
our parents brought that on themselves
what are you talking about
the box it was in their house
they were the ones hiding it
all those lives could have been spared
seems we didnt knew our parents
as well as we thought we did

to the future of the city

concern then you should focus
on the task at hand
tell me do you appreciate irony
you tested positive for erudite
so you must have the
intellectual capacity
irony
for instance right now you are
filled with hate
but you need to pass an amity sim
then there are other ironies at work too
such as the fact your cherished mother
dont
who you so dauntlessly saved in the sim
is the reason youre in
this mess to begin with
you are the reason im in this mess
and then there the most
poignant irony of all
stop
that nathalie prior not only died
trying to protect the data
that i now have in my possession
because you stole it from her
you killed her for it
data that she so
selfishly withheld
but her own daughter
her beloved divergent tris
is going to be the one
to deliver it to me
i said stop
therefore
your mothers death just like
your boyfriends death
will mean absolutely nothing

initializing message
hello
i come from outside the wall
where we have all but destroyed each other
we designed your city
as an experiment
we believe it is the only way
to recover the humanity
we have lost
and we created factions to ensure peace
but we believe there will be
those among you who
will transcend these factions
these will be the divergent
they are the true purpose
of this experiment
they are vital to humanitys survival
if youre watching this now
then at least one of you is proof
that our experiment
has succeeded
the time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us
we have allowed you to believe
that youre the last of us
but youre not
mankind waits for you with hope
beyond the wall
you okay
yeah
yes
you were wrong about us
we were never the problem
were the solution
bury the box
what
no one sees it
ever
kill them both
no
dont move
down
put your weapons down now
stay
put it down
do not move
hello jeanine
evelyn
impressive
i think were going to like it here
do you honestly think the other
factions will stand for this
because youre so popular
get her out of here
when that message gets out
it will be the end
what message
youll see
im going to put it on
every monitor in the city
founder via loudspeaker
we have separated you
from the rest of us
and we created factions to ensure peace
the time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us
we have allowed you to believe
that youre the last of us
but youre not
if youre watching this now
then at least one of you is proof
that our experiment
has succeeded
mankind waits for you
with hope
beyond the wall
these will be the divergent
they are the true purpose
of this experiment
they are vital
to humanitys survival
you did it
yeah
everyones staring at me
you changed everything
