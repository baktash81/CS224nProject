not all the way home 
the roads are dangerous 
 but i   
 forget your dress  yes 
come 
mom s wedding ring 
the only other woman who s ever
accompanied me was your mother 
you re old enough 
i thought you should
wear something of hers 
your uncle is downstairs 
wear your dress 
oh  my god 
no 
run 
jonna 
jonn
jo
go  go  find my brother 
jonna 
this is luka lesek 
he runs the largest human trafficking
operation in all of eastern europe 
it s women and children mostly 
used for forced labor 
prostitution  and so on 
and he runs the local police 
of course  with kickbacks 
and did i tell you 
just around the corner
from where you are now 
the most marvelous bar   
i don t know what it s like now 
but in the  90s 
the most beautiful women
in all of eastern europe 
you love the sound of your own voice 
don t you  old man 
morgan  dear boy  i m just trying to help 
you know 
there s more to life than just   
you know  i d love to take the travel tips
from an aging lothario like yourself 
but now really is not the time 
all right  well  i ll leave you to it 
and do me a favor 
try not to reduce the splendid city
of ljubljana to rubble 
i can t make any promises 
travel safe 
 nor dread nor hope attend a dying animal
 a man awaits his end
 dreading and hoping all  
fuck 
where are you  bastard 
fuck 
come on 
god 
i m glad i got you  morgan 
tell me all about it 
well  to say it didn t go well
would be a slight understatement 
i m sorry to hear that  care to explain 
digging a bullet out of my body  but   
somebody shot me as i targeted lesek 
you know  a little flesh wound
here and there 
that s pretty much
part of the job description 
it felt calculated  professional 
i think there was a third party involved 
another shooter 
well  thank god you re alive 
what about lesek 
the guy who shot me shot him 
clearly not too selective 
right  well  i ll dig around 
and see what i can find out 
another thing 
there s a new job  came in after you left 
i think it s about time that we let
some young guns take over  buddy 
people who don t mind getting shot 
no  no  no  no 
morgan  this isn t something
we just pass up 
this is big 
so travel safe 
we ll talk about it
when you get back  all right 
my day just got better 
are you hurt 
oh  no 
just tired  really long day 
i can hear it  video  please 
the signal s not that great  babe 
i don t think i m gonna get picture up 
come on  i miss seeing you 
i don t sleep well when you re not here 
and you know that 
i think you tie that robe too tight 
do i 
so maybe i should loosen it 
that does feel better 
sorry  connection s bad 
that s just cruel 
look  i got to    i gotta go 
you got a plane to catch 
good  love you 
i miss you 
oh  god 
the attack culminated
in the demise of luca lesek 
leader of the ljubljana crime ring 
a rival syndicate  perhaps 
a personal feud  it s possible 
but if you look at the autopsy reports 
it will indicate otherwise 
clearly this was done by a trained hand 
if we look at the wounds here 
they re way too precise
for what we expect
from a typical gang war 
the bullet s entry
and its pinpoint accuracy
would suggest an assassination 
personal belief  a contract killer
with a military background 
our best option at the moment
is to work with the local authorities 
so  ladies and gentlemen 
let s get to work 
we got a lot to do 
thank you 
what s been happening in the world today 
what are you up to 
to no good 
graffiti  okay 
well  you gotta practice more  buddy 
how about you 
come on  i know you re a good person 
buy him some water or something 
there we go 
there are still
some good people in this world 
there she is 
i missed you 
it s so good to see you 
got you something 
this one looks like it s had a rough life 
like you wouldn t believe 
one of these days you re gonna let me
get you something nice 
i prefer this 
 let s go home 
 i ll get you more of them 
you re a sight for sore eyes 
it s so good to have you back 
 hi 
 hi 
 what s this 
 it s nothing 
it s just a scratch 
you know how clumsy i am 
what the fuck  morgan 
what s this 
i didn t want to tell you 
but i know how much you hate motorcycles 
one of the guys had one 
next thing i know 
i m upside down in a ditch 
i m sorry  but it s nothing 
 it s fine 
 it s not fine 
every time you go away 
bruises  cuts  scratches   
now this 
 i m here now  aren t i 
 and what about tomorrow 
tomorrow i m gonna be here  too 
and the next day and the next day
and the day after that 
you can t get rid of me that easy 
promise 
if you can keep me down 
sure  i ll promise 
 i will 
 yeah 
shit 
 are you okay 
 i m fine 
just double broken ribs  but okay 
the instructions were very clear 
yeah  and i told you i m out 
morgan  it was a close thing 
i understand 
and you faced your own mortality  yes 
but look  it was an off day 
we all have off days 
gyoza  they re very good 
i don t think you re listening to me 
i m out 
i m out  too 
of soy sauce 
waiter 
 you re insufferable 
 morgan  sit down  come on 
don t be so dramatic  come on 
it s not that simple 
the client specifically requested you 
why 
because of your boyish good looks 
your devilish charm  who knows 
or maybe they re just fans of your work 
it doesn t matter 
the thing is  it s not one job 
it s six  six separate contracts 
and each one pays a million dollars 
now  that money would set you up for life 
 what kind of life would that be 
 whatever you want it to be 
it s  6 million 
i don t know if you re familiar
with that sort of concept 
but that can buy you
an awful lot of bottles of pinot noir 
we re doing good work 
 good 
 necessary work 
these are evil men 
now  i know they re supposed to pay
for their sins in the next life 
but why wait for that 
i don t know  this last job   
i know  but you survived 
 and you know why 
  cause that s what you trained me to do 
this is what you re meant to do 
now  these six contracts   
remember when
we first started working together 
i was just a kid 
i had no plan  no connections  no clue 
now i ve had my time  okay 
there comes a point when
you need to understand when to quit 
when you re still able to wake up
in the morning and enjoy a sunrise 
i fucking love my sunrises  caldwell 
i really do 
so if you want that money bad enough 
you re gonna have to squeeze
those triggers yourself 
what s this about  morgan 
there s three reasons
why people like us stop 
the first one is we find god 
now  in your case 
i think that s extremely unlikely 
the second one is 
and i do hope it s not this  a woman 
now  that s never a good enough reason 
trust me  i know 
 and the third one   
 we re dead 
yes  we die 
but not you  morgan 
no  not you 
now   
gyoza 
come on  they re really very good 
i fucking hate you sometimes 
you know that 
oh  my god  the amount of things
they put in mayonnaise 
hey  grab that pasta  it s my favorite 
this is my corner right here 
my favorite cereal 
it s got a secret decoder ring inside 
there is no prize  come on 
well  they wouldn t put it
on the front of the box 
i mean  that defeats the object
of it being a secret 
besides  i m gonna use it
to figure things out 
like why you deserve me 
well  i know the answer to that already 
that s easy 
i don t 
 for the kids 
 too much sugar 
 maybe something else 
 keep them for myself then 
it s fate 
 our first pet 
 it s a plant 
well  yeah  but you still gotta
feed it and things  right 
 water it 
 take it out 
 like for walks and things 
 sure  why not 
your responsibility 
think it will be us one day 
i bet they re out here every single night 
watch 
he s gonna take his jacket off
and put it around her shoulders 
and then she s gonna grab his hand again 
wow  four years  and i still don t know
how you do that 
you just have to predict 
all the threads are there 
you just piece them together
and figure it out  i guess 
what do you think about that couple 
i think he looks more interested
in the girl with the white boots than her 
yeah  and she knows it 
but she won t say she s upset 
well  her body language will give it away 
she s either gonna look away
or fold her arms 
so you always know what i m gonna do next 
no 
you should come home with me 
my parents are tired
of only hearing stories about you 
handsome  smart  kind photojournalist 
they think i made you up 
it does sound like you did make me up 
what do you think
about this guy on our left 
he s wondering why
you re avoiding the subject 
okay  i ll come home with you 
aren t you full of surprises these days 
and you know what 
you re not the only one 
 so you have some surprises  too 
 maybe 
and before you ask 
it s not about my art program 
somebody help me 
what are you doing 
you re photographing him 
it s all right  it s over 
you re safe  okay 
we need to call the police 
 we can t just   
 we gotta go  sophie 
you just killed a man 
left his body in the park 
we need to call the police 
it was self defense  i ll tell them you   
don t touch me 
the things you did to him 
how were you able to 
you searched his body for what 
for an id 
for foreign currency  some sort of lead 
you know  i need to find out who he was 
was he after you 
so this wasn t any kind of robbery or   
morgan  answer me 
i don t have the answers 
all i know is that
you are not safe with me 
i just need time 
give me time 
show me the contracts 
i want to see
the goddamn contracts  caldwell 
show me the fucking files
or you re going to be the job 
this is the second time this week
that there s been a targeted hit on me 
i want to know why 
the timing of those contracts
isn t a fucking coincidence 
well  i ll do some digging around 
see what i can find out 
who are they 
 oh  christ  don t you ever knock 
 who are they 
you know  there are certain civilities
when you enter a chap s place  you know 
the man who tried to kill me 
well  composition s nice 
subject matter s a touch macabre 
find out who he is and who sent him 
i can tell you who he is 
his name s alec drakos 
greek national  special ops 
couple of tours of afghanistan 
became a mercenary 
ultimately a gun for hire 
and i bet he s the chap
that shot you in slovenia 
look at this  better days 
now  on the plus side 
a million dollars
will be wired to your account 
plus my usual fee 
and i will take care
of the finger business 
mr  rossi  who has a liberal view
when it comes to bribery 
caldwell  what the fuck
are you talking about 
right  i forgot to tell you 
each kill must be confirmed
by the receipt of a finger
to a postal box in paris 
so  listen to me 
you are in now 
i have accepted the job 
i didn t accept anything 
drakos was one of your contracts 
good result  only five to go 
humor me  who are the others 
who are the others 
you know  the worst of the worst 
backgrounds in espionage
in the military  and crime  of course 
what s the thread 
 what do they have in common 
 which is 
their occupation 
they are assassins  morgan  like you 
just let me get this right 
i ve been hired to assassinate assassins 
and they ve been hired to kill me 
and each other 
fact is  morgan  they were coming for you 
whether you accepted or not 
but  on the plus side 
same odds  even playing field 
 this isn t a fucking game 
 yes  it is 
to the person who set this up 
this is a game 
and if you want to live  you have to play 
here 
morgan  you ve got this 
anselm ryder 
no  no 
a ruthless psychopath 
signature move 
collect a finger from the victim 
a souvenir of sorts 
pablo martinez 
mr  martinez is a poisoner 
yuko 
yuko is deadly with blades 
and in close combat 
the charming demir
is an opportunistic sociopath 
he s locked up in a maximum security
prison in bosnia 
finding him is simple 
but access will be tricky 
falk 
now  falk is a legend and problematic 
no positive ids  no photos  no patterns 
just a trail of bodies and cover ups
that are only possible
if falk s working   
   from within the intelligence community 
now  each kill must be confirmed
by the receipt of a finger
to a postal box in paris 
 demir 
 who are you 
what do you want 
good news 
you re being released today 
pierre  i have a gift for you 
thanks  inspector leon 
welcome  inspector leon 
taking precautions  i see 
aren t you 
maat  the egyptian goddess   
of justice 
my reminder to stay focused 
a penthouse in an empty building in paris 
 how did you manage   
 i bought the building 
drink 
and when we say drink  we mean vodka 
i m on duty 
don t trust a man
who won t drink with you 
that s what my uncle mariusz says 
but consider the source 
one assassin s been killed 
alec drakos 
the responding officer s bodycam 
how did you get this 
i hacked the video server
of the rome police 
who killed him 
we don t know 
 what about the others 
 still searching 
these are very skilled people 
aliases  no digital traces 
they avoid all patterns 
i handed you detailed files
on all of them  didn t i 
so stop telling me things i know 
and start telling me things i don t 
six million dollars 
your boss said that would lure them out 
 now where are they 
 her plan takes time 
and you re not the only one
who needs to protect his back 
 one mistake   
 then don t make any 
wake up 
where am i 
you received a package 
box number 115  what do you know about it 
who the fuck are you 
we re gonna play a very short game 
you don t answer my questions 
or you tell me some lies 
i ll blow your damn brains out 
who are you and who do you work for 
 answer me 
 my name is leon 
inspector  french police 
a finger arrives along with
the name of the person it was attached to 
we publish a fake obituary in le monde
just to confirm receipt 
within a few days 
we receive a file detailing every single
assassination this person committed 
and then
we open investigations into them 
how were you first contacted 
email  anonymous  untraceable 
we simply followed the directions
and posted the first fake obituary
just to say yes 
 under what name 
 maat 
maat  what is that 
maat  we found it was
an egyptian goddess of truth and justice 
she set the order of the universe right
after the chaos of its creation 
 and 
 and she weighs the hearts of the dead
just to see if they re too heavy with evil
to reach paradise 
what significance is that to you 
i believe the message in the name
is perhaps for you 
no 
morgan gaines 
we re alive  but not quite living 
dead 
but not yet in the grave 
stuck in this half life  until it ends 
when is that 
do you really think
the last surviving assassin will just be
free to enjoy his newfound riches 
no  he ll be hunted down  too 
unless   
unless we help each other
find the person who s holding our strings 
the puppet master
we re all dancing to now  and 
and 
kill him 
performance wasn t bad 
how long did you practice that for 
he speaks 
mr  gaines 
it s in our mutual interest
to communicate 
collaborate 
we should share what we know 
why don t you share first 
i m happy to 
just give me an address
and a time you ll be there 
and i ll tell you in person 
we can share electronically 
okey dokey  sweetie 
but you re taking all the fun out of it 
he bled out like a pig 
sure smelled like one  too 
so how about you send me
a photo of yourself now 
no 
but i m sure
you smell better than poor demir 
not gonna let you bleed out 
i wanna see you try 
we ll see out of the both of us
who bleeds out first 
 great man and his pride
confronting murderous men  
a great man 
as military snipers 
we were taught when we lock onto a target 
to whisper to ourselves 
steady our breathing 
release all consequence 
and then squeeze the trigger 
i used to recite this poem death
by william butler yeats 
catchy title 
i think we re being told something here 
the money was most likely
put up by a client
who had hired all of us in the past 
we re from different countries 
our hits spread all over the world 
exactly 
we took out our marks
using different methods 
i mean  nothing would point to one person
doing all of these hits 
now he wants to silence us 
maybe  but why not just hire
one of us to kill us all 
why now 
why go after assassins that aren t active 
demir 
he d been in prison
for the last four years 
i think they re trying to make a point 
we re meant to feel
the consequences of what we ve done 
what it s like to be targeted 
here s my number 
it s a secure line 
we make a great team 
in fact  here s a little
parting gift for you 
it s pablo martinez s location 
bye  morgan 
i can tell you who he is 
his name s alec drakos 
special ops  couple tours of afghanistan 
greek national 
they are assassins  morgan  like you 
christ  not again 
what would be so terribly wrong
with ringing the buzzer 
when i was targeting lesek in slovenia 
you knew those six contracts
were already running  didn t you 
my computer was hacked  was that you 
your phone records show that you called
alec drakos in slovenia
after you spoke to me 
again in turino 
you lied about his profile 
he was ex royal marines  like me 
sniper recon division  just like me 
no friends  no family 
grew up in foster care 
like me 
you lied about everything 
i think you ve got this terribly wrong 
you were his handler  too 
you fed him his intel 
you told him he could
pick up the lesek contract
if he got rid of me first  didn t you 
morgan  this only works
if we completely   
you told him my location 
you sent him to fucking kill me 
bullet came this close to my head 
this close to sophie s head 
bring back memories 
 better days   as you put it 
morgan  calm down 
okay  drakos worked for me as well 
but it was the game
that set you up against each other 
there was no other way 
and choosing between you 
it s like choosing between your children 
but you did choose 
and you chose him 
no  listen to me  listen to me 
of course i set this up between you 
i had to  there was no choice 
but i did so
in the full and certain knowledge
that you would win 
you were never going to lose to drakos 
you re the best  morgan 
you re the gold standard 
bullshit 
was it always about the money for you 
did any of my kills actually deserve it 
all of them  each one 
once you see the lies 
you see the liar  too 
the number to my burner phone
that only you knew
was compromised by falk 
 i gave her nothing 
 her 
so you re saying
you actually know this woman 
your arrogance made you careless 
you traitor 
she knows who you are 
she broke into your records just as i did 
up until now 
it s just been the means
to get close to me 
but once she runs out of her patience 
she s gonna come looking for you 
and have much more of a hands on approach 
you re gonna wish
i put a fucking bullet in your head 
morgan  i m sorry 
listen  you can do this 
we can do this 
we ve been through so much together 
you were like a father to me 
i taught you everything i know 
there s nothing fucking left 
welcome to the game 
mr  gaines 
tell me about your end 
 6 million for the contracts 
their money is in an offshore account
that traces to kyiv  ukraine 
now  if look at all our hits tied to kyiv 
you will find a common theme 
they are all linked to gas pipelines 
which is a billion dollar industry 
mariusz ilych 
his company has been awarded every major
construction project for the past decade 
because we got rid
of anyone standing in his way 
including his own brother  yakov 
now he considers us loose ends 
maybe his niece jonna
discovered what her uncle did 
now  if she traced her uncle s payments
to all of us   
but didn t know which assassin
killed her daddy 
she could have set us up
against each other 
pablo martinez  a bit of an anomaly 
never uses a gun  prefers poison 
 nor dread nor hope attend
a dying animal    
no kills for 10 years 
disappeared after that 
been off the grid ever since 
 a man awaits his end
 dreading and hoping all    
he s a lone wolf  no wife 
  many times he died    
 no kids 
 many times he rose again    
oh  my god  yes 
give me a kiss 
okay  now you can come with me  but  i   
fuck 
drop the ax 
drop the fucking ax  turn around 
slowly 
easy 
that girl in there  is that your daughter 
 where s the mother 
 breast cancer  two years ago 
just the two of you here  alone 
take anything 
do whatever you want to me 
but my daughter  she s only four  please 
were you offered contracts recently 
answer the fucking question 
i don t know what it is  i don t know 
tell me what date it is today 
today  may    5th 
you kill people for a living 
i know exactly who you are 
so you don t fucking lie to me 
otherwise may 5th is gonna
go down in your daughter s memory
as the last day she saw her daddy alive 
i killed one person 
eight years ago 
and the nightmares only left me
after my daughter was born 
what about that job  tell me about it 
daddy  you said 10 minutes for ice cream 
yes  honey  daddy s coming 
please 
 wanna color 
 i m fine 
maybe next picture  i do a lot 
you do 
whichever cup you want 
tell me about the last job of yours 
where was it 
in prague 
i botched it 
slipped thallium sulfate in his coffee 
but the dosage was too weak 
hospital for 18 days 
his hair fell out 
he lost almost 100 pounds 
and he got a hole in his throat
to help him breathe 
i went to the hospital 
sat in the chapel 
i m not sure
if i was praying for him or myself 
after that  i disappeared 
i was done 
daddy  why are you sad 
no  honey 
dad is just telling a sad story 
okay 
you just give me as many details
as you remember 
somebody s pit us against each other 
i want to find out why and who 
he must know
you ll come for him in the end 
yeah  you can bet on that 
do you mind 
blue s my favorite color 
but it s okay if you use it 
thank you 
it s my favorite color  too 
honey  do you want more milk 
 can i have more milk  please 
 yes 
you need to stay away from the windows 
you might not
have received those contracts 
but there s still
a million dollar bounty on your head 
do you have a gun 
i ve got a home phone 
less than 10 people have the number 
and they all live within 20 miles 
i don t use my real name 
i ve gone as far from my past as i can 
well  your past has caught up with you 
they re coming 
yuko 
yuko is a martial arts master
most feared for her blade work 
and she has
perhaps some lingering daddy issues 
now  if her mark is a woman 
she makes a clean strike to her heart 
but  if it s a man 
she prefers to cut him open 
evisceration 
her only weakness 
she dresses very light  no armor 
so  if you can manage it 
a single bullet to the chest
ought to put her to rest 
are you okay 
what took you so long 
thank you 
it s for your own good 
daddy  daddy  what s happening 
come here  come here  come here 
one bullet  my ass 
don t worry 
oh  shit 
death has come to call 
i m afraid so 
it s been a long time
since i heard your voice  falk 
 or should i call you vicky 
 don t call me that 
will my death be painful 
it s a warm feeling  like a soft blanket 
just let it pass over and you ll sleep 
how very kind 
how long do i have 
about an hour 
the fact that i m not already dead
leads me to believe
that you need something else from me 
what is it 
morgan gaines  i want his file and mine 
you already have his file 
you hacked my computer 
well  i have the official file 
i want the personal 
the one that you keep 
 vicky   
 don t call me that 
you seem to forget i m dying 
why should i give you anything 
because of this 
the antidote 
i don t believe that for a second 
believe it or not  i don t care 
but if you want to live   
all right  well  let me think about this 
meantime  i think
i ll fix myself a drink and   
perhaps you d like to join me 
we could have a good chat 
please sit 
sit down 
you ll take that seat  sit right here 
as you wish 
you can t blame me for trying 
i don t blame you 
i don t blame you for anything 
the past is the past 
now  give me what i need 
so  here it is  your file  encrypted 
who else has seen this 
no one 
not even morgan 
no 
as far as he s concerned 
you re an enigma and a mystery 
gone 
now   
morgan  please 
this girl  this woman   
she is bright  she is kind 
and she knows nothing 
and she s nothing to you 
so i should let her live 
a little bit sentimental for you 
i m dying  falk 
dying can bring out
the sentimental in a man 
morgan s my protégé just as you were 
and whatever you think 
i m not gonna betray him 
you betrayed him before 
not this time 
so  if you don t mind 
you might just let an old man
rest his tired eyes 
and enjoy what s left of the evening 
have it your way  old man 
look what you did 
you   
just lost the privilege
of a peaceful death 
pick up  caldwell 
can i speak to signor chivasso  please 
who s this 
morgan gaines 
mom killed at age four  dad gave you up 
foster care kind of unpleasant 
i don t need my fucking history 
i ve lived through it 
royal marine sniper
taken under the wing of ian caldwell 
who offered you the chance
to kill evil men for your government 
except it wasn t always
for your government 
and the men weren t always evil 
you re a monster  falk 
or should i call you agent vos 
well  caldwell  that snake 
did you know that he lied to you 
that he changed marks  background 
exaggerated their crimes 
omitted that they had children 
people that loved them 
just like i assumed you loved your mom 
time s running out 
after i kill ryder  you re next 
do you think that caldwell
was trying to ease your conscience 
you think you re a good man 
don t you  morgan 
you re just a slave to your emotions 
that s where we re different 
 cause i m free 
you want to get
to who s behind this or not 
my condolences  by the way  for caldwell 
we all hope for a death without suffering 
in his case 
it simply was impossible 
such a shame though 
i want to believe
that there s at least one person honest 
well  at least you still have sophie 
she s real cute 
ryder will take care of her 
you got good taste 
hey  you  i can t talk right now 
sophie  you need to do exactly what i say 
can i call you back  i was just   
there s someone coming for you 
you need to get to a safe house 
get rid of your phone 
that can be tracked 
the address is 105 via roma 
apartment 42d 
what do you mean someone s coming for   
sophie 
fuck 
there s an active shooter
at arcabaleno school 
 you need to hurry 
 okay  we re on our way 
sophie  sophie 
are you hurt 
tell me what the fuck is going on 
okay  you deserve the truth 
when i was younger  i joined the military 
i thought it was a just cause 
i thought i was doing my part for society 
well  it turns out there s
a lot of red tape behind saving lives 
i need to show you something 
after i left the royal marines 
i met a man named caldwell 
he became like a mentor to me 
introduced me to this world 
he acted like a mediator between clients 
these clients wanted people dead 
bad people 
murderers  rapists  corrupt officials 
over the years  i became numb 
it all became meaningless 
until you came into my life 
you changed everything 
you showed me a life
that i thought i didn t deserve 
now i need to fight to protect you 
because i love you  sophie 
i m pregnant 
i leave tomorrow 
go to my mother for a few weeks in lisbon 
then i ll be back to my job  to my life 
so whatever this is  you make it stop 
you leave tonight 
so 
there are two this time 
two from the same person 
nope there is a man s finger   
   and a woman s finger 
what did you get yourself into  old boy 
why is that you chose the hard way out 
jesus christ 
certainly wasn t loved as a kid 
everything clear  yeah 
we know who we re dealing with 
shoot to kill 
let s go 
we just got confirmation
from the satellite footage 
ryder and morgan are here 
don t worry  jonna 
the nightmare stops today 
 we re gonna get him 
 okay 
i will take you to the airport 
laced with strychnine 
very fatal and extremely fucking painful 
why don t you take a seat 
it s quite the collection you have here 
somewhat of a signature
for you now  isn t it 
i bet if i dig deep enough 
i m gonna find yakov ilych s finger 
i don t know that person 
don t fucking lie to me 
good thing about strychnine is
it doesn t fuck with your brain 
so you re gonna know
when every single muscle in your body
contracts simultaneously 
the pain only intensifying
with the slightest of stimulation 
that s where i come in 
now give my fucking answers
and i ll put you
out of your fucking misery 
because she got to you  too 
tell you it was in your common interest
to collaborate 
a little souvenir 
go  go  go  go  go

i ll call you back later 
the rules of that
little lying game we played 
you remember them  right 
is kidnapping me again
absolutely necessary 
just send me an email or call me 
the woman you re protecting 
you don t even know who the fuck she is 
agent vos and falk are the same person 
she s using you to kill people 
all right  let s go 
i have a plan to stop her 
but we need to move now 
you re going to help me
whether you like it or not 
come on  leon  i know you re a good man 
where would she be 
knowing her  waiting for your body 
inspector leon 
sorry to call you late  we found his body 
show me his face 
sorry to interrupt  falk  agent vos 
whatever your name is 
falk  agent vos  whatever your name is 
why don t you explain to leon
who you really are 
what a disappointment you are 
officer down  i need backup 
request some backup now 
the brigade was alerted to the incident
at around 12 30 a m 
it s not clear whether the incident
was an accident or deliberate 
construction mogul mariusz ilych
wins parliament bid 
the mogul s late brother  yakov ilych 
founded the gas production empire
before his untimely death 
yakov s daughter  jonna ilych 
supports her uncle  mariusz 
in his campaign 
there will be a formal celebration
tomorrow in prague 
thank you  maxim 
you are done for today  you can go 
you forgot something 
don t move 
nice to meet you  jonna 
or should i call you maat 
maat  i don t know this person 
of course you do 
you set up this game for vengeance 
but in fact  it was your uncle
who killed your father 
no  he paid someone like you to do that 
just like you paid a group of us
to kill each other 
six million dollars buys a lot of bodies 
i don t 
that money was to stop my uncle 
and to arrest all of you 
arrest us 
how 
my uncle kept me close to control me 
made me part of the machine helping him 
a mass murderer
seized power over an entire country 
he liked to parade me out 
the poor orphan he saved 
but if i questioned him 
he would have
taken out a contract on me  too 
that s how he solved problems 
i was helping them to end this 
 helping who 
 agents 
which agents 
jonna ilych  agent vos 
i m taking over the investigation 
inspector leon  you report directly to me 
so is everything on here 
yes  as much as i could gather
on my uncle s circle of assassins 
targets  money transfers 
he kept encrypted records of everything 
what about him  falk 
do you have anything else on him 
his real name or   
no  he covers his tracks really well 
we have nothing on him 
have you shown this to anyone else 
no 
i am really sorry about your father 
if we had enough money as bait 
we could offer a contract
to each of the assassins 
and then create some imaginary bait
for them to kill 
lure them out of the shadows
and capture them 
how much money would you need 
the lead investigator 
do you know who she was 
agent vos 
not the name she gave you  who she was 
you handed those files over to falk 
that s the woman that killed your father 
no 
no 
once you did that 
she couldn t risk being exposed 
so she had to get rid of the evidence 
that meant your uncle 
the assassins he hired  and you 
so she created a deadly game
that she could manipulate
from behind the agency 
even used leon 
fed him the exact lies to tell us 
but that s not   
my father s finger was cut off 
falk mirrors methods of other assassins 
she was mimicking ryder
to throw off the investigators 
everything she s done
has led to either trying to kill me 
or for me to stand here and kill you 
what about the money  where is it 
gone 
the agency has no record of it 
or any meeting we ever had 
so the money never went to anyone 
falk kept the money 
i got word from the agency
only an hour ago 
they told me agent vos is dead now 
she was on a mission in italy 
and apparently had a heart attack 
sophie 
it s just me  it s okay 
 is it over 
 i hope so 
i don t like that answer 
oh  god  what did they do to you 
it s okay  it s okay 
i ll heal 
listen  i can t stay for long 
where are you going 
i have to go back to the apartment 
i have to get some clothes 
i need you to do me a favor 
you keep the door closed 
if you re thinking about disappearing 
i don t want that 
we stay together 
you promised me 
 it s a girl 
 our daughter 
stupid kid 
morgan  you know your biggest mistake 
you want to live 
not just survive 
but live 
love  care 
it makes you vulnerable 
it makes you weak 
if you got a shot  you d better take it 
no 
you re gonna suffer first 
just like me 
how did you put it 
 feel the consequences
of what you ve done  
we have unfinished business 
one last contract unfulfilled 
you re going to kill yourself 
this conversation s over 
you and me know better than anyone
that every life has a price 
and i know yours 
you better run fast 
you don t want to miss this show 
leon  falk is still alive  she has sophie 
i need you now 
i m sending you an address  be there 
sophie 
sophie 
i d be still if i were you 
if you move your leg from that wire 
you re gonna blow up 
i guess we ve got
a little bit less than five minutes left 
give me your gun 
come on  give me your gun 
fuck 
good boy 
so  we got one last game to play 
the game s done  it s over  you ve won 
let her go  there s nothing more 
so here s the spin 
that s a countdown to disarm 
so in about four minutes you ll be safe 
but sophie would have drowned 
so you got a decision to make 
either you watch
the mother of your unborn child die
or you let the bomb go off 
and you all die together 
which is romantic 
whatever choice you make i win  you lose 
the game is mine 
so do you know if it s a boy or a girl 
have you thought about a name 
 cause i think falk is pretty cute 
hey 
come on  get up now 
get up  turn around  show me your face 
have fun  ciao 
sophie 
just stay calm 
stay calm  baby 
leon 
help us  please
