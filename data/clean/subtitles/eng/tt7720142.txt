not all the way home
the roads are dangerous
but i
forget your dress yes
come
moms wedding ring
the only other woman whos ever
accompanied me was your mother
youre old enough
i thought you should
wear something of hers
your uncle is downstairs
wear your dress
oh my god
no
run
jonna
jonn
jo
go go find my brother
jonna
this is luka lesek
he runs the largest human trafficking
operation in all of eastern europe
its women and children mostly
used for forced labor
prostitution and so on
and he runs the local police
of course with kickbacks
and did i tell you
just around the corner
from where you are now
the most marvelous bar
i dont know what its like now
but in the 90s
the most beautiful women
in all of eastern europe
you love the sound of your own voice
dont you old man
morgan dear boy im just trying to help
you know
theres more to life than just
you know id love to take the travel tips
from an aging lothario like yourself
but now really is not the time
all right well ill leave you to it
and do me a favor
try not to reduce the splendid city
of ljubljana to rubble
i cant make any promises
travel safe
nor dread nor hope attend a dying animal
a man awaits his end
dreading and hoping all
fuck
where are you bastard
fuck
come on
god
im glad i got you morgan
tell me all about it
well to say it didnt go well
would be a slight understatement
im sorry to hear that care to explain
digging a bullet out of my body but
somebody shot me as i targeted lesek
you know a little flesh wound
here and there
thats pretty much
part of the job description
it felt calculated professional
i think there was a third party involved
another shooter
well thank god youre alive
what about lesek
the guy who shot me shot him
clearly not too selective
right well ill dig around
and see what i can find out
another thing
theres a new job came in after you left
i think its about time that we let
some young guns take over buddy
people who dont mind getting shot
no no no no
morgan this isnt something
we just pass up
this is big
so travel safe
well talk about it
when you get back all right
my day just got better
are you hurt
oh no
just tired really long day
i can hear it video please
the signals not that great babe
i dont think im gonna get picture up
come on i miss seeing you
i dont sleep well when youre not here
and you know that
i think you tie that robe too tight
do i
so maybe i should loosen it
that does feel better
sorry connections bad
thats just cruel
look i got to i gotta go
you got a plane to catch
good love you
i miss you
oh god
the attack culminated
in the demise of luca lesek
leader of the ljubljana crime ring
a rival syndicate perhaps
a personal feud its possible
but if you look at the autopsy reports
it will indicate otherwise
clearly this was done by a trained hand
if we look at the wounds here
theyre way too precise
for what we expect
from a typical gang war
the bullets entry
and its pinpoint accuracy
would suggest an assassination
personal belief a contract killer
with a military background
our best option at the moment
is to work with the local authorities
so ladies and gentlemen
lets get to work
we got a lot to do
thank you
whats been happening in the world today
what are you up to
to no good
graffiti okay
well you gotta practice more buddy
how about you
come on i know youre a good person
buy him some water or something
there we go
there are still
some good people in this world
there she is
i missed you
its so good to see you
got you something
this one looks like its had a rough life
like you wouldnt believe
one of these days youre gonna let me
get you something nice
i prefer this
lets go home
ill get you more of them
youre a sight for sore eyes
its so good to have you back
hi
hi
whats this
its nothing
its just a scratch
you know how clumsy i am
what the fuck morgan
whats this
i didnt want to tell you
but i know how much you hate motorcycles
one of the guys had one
next thing i know
im upside down in a ditch
im sorry but its nothing
its fine
its not fine
every time you go away
bruises cuts scratches
now this
im here now arent i
and what about tomorrow
tomorrow im gonna be here too
and the next day and the next day
and the day after that
you cant get rid of me that easy
promise
if you can keep me down
sure ill promise
i will
yeah
shit
are you okay
im fine
just double broken ribs but okay
the instructions were very clear
yeah and i told you im out
morgan it was a close thing
i understand
and you faced your own mortality yes
but look it was an off day
we all have off days
gyoza theyre very good
i dont think youre listening to me
im out
im out too
of soy sauce
waiter
youre insufferable
morgan sit down come on
dont be so dramatic come on
its not that simple
the client specifically requested you
why
because of your boyish good looks
your devilish charm who knows
or maybe theyre just fans of your work
it doesnt matter
the thing is its not one job
its six six separate contracts
and each one pays a million dollars
now that money would set you up for life
what kind of life would that be
whatever you want it to be
its 6 million
i dont know if youre familiar
with that sort of concept
but that can buy you
an awful lot of bottles of pinot noir
were doing good work
good
necessary work
these are evil men
now i know theyre supposed to pay
for their sins in the next life
but why wait for that
i dont know this last job
i know but you survived
and you know why
cause thats what you trained me to do
this is what youre meant to do
now these six contracts
remember when
we first started working together
i was just a kid
i had no plan no connections no clue
now ive had my time okay
there comes a point when
you need to understand when to quit
when youre still able to wake up
in the morning and enjoy a sunrise
i fucking love my sunrises caldwell
i really do
so if you want that money bad enough
youre gonna have to squeeze
those triggers yourself
whats this about morgan
theres three reasons
why people like us stop
the first one is we find god
now in your case
i think thats extremely unlikely
the second one is
and i do hope its not this a woman
now thats never a good enough reason
trust me i know
and the third one
were dead
yes we die
but not you morgan
no not you
now
gyoza
come on theyre really very good
i fucking hate you sometimes
you know that
oh my god the amount of things
they put in mayonnaise
hey grab that pasta its my favorite
this is my corner right here
my favorite cereal
its got a secret decoder ring inside
there is no prize come on
well they wouldnt put it
on the front of the box
i mean that defeats the object
of it being a secret
besides im gonna use it
to figure things out
like why you deserve me
well i know the answer to that already
thats easy
i dont
for the kids
too much sugar
maybe something else
keep them for myself then
its fate
our first pet
its a plant
well yeah but you still gotta
feed it and things right
water it
take it out
like for walks and things
sure why not
your responsibility
think it will be us one day
i bet theyre out here every single night
watch
hes gonna take his jacket off
and put it around her shoulders
and then shes gonna grab his hand again
wow four years and i still dont know
how you do that
you just have to predict
all the threads are there
you just piece them together
and figure it out i guess
what do you think about that couple
i think he looks more interested
in the girl with the white boots than her
yeah and she knows it
but she wont say shes upset
well her body language will give it away
shes either gonna look away
or fold her arms
so you always know what im gonna do next
no
you should come home with me
my parents are tired
of only hearing stories about you
handsome smart kind photojournalist
they think i made you up
it does sound like you did make me up
what do you think
about this guy on our left
hes wondering why
youre avoiding the subject
okay ill come home with you
arent you full of surprises these days
and you know what
youre not the only one
so you have some surprises too
maybe
and before you ask
its not about my art program
somebody help me
what are you doing
youre photographing him
its all right its over
youre safe okay
we need to call the police
we cant just
we gotta go sophie
you just killed a man
left his body in the park
we need to call the police
it was selfdefense ill tell them you
dont touch me
the things you did to him
how were you able to
you searched his body for what
for an id
for foreign currency some sort of lead
you know i need to find out who he was
was he after you
so this wasnt any kind of robbery or
morgan answer me
i dont have the answers
all i know is that
you are not safe with me
i just need time
give me time
show me the contracts
i want to see
the goddamn contracts caldwell
show me the fucking files
or youre going to be the job
this is the second time this week
that theres been a targeted hit on me
i want to know why
the timing of those contracts
isnt a fucking coincidence
well ill do some digging around
see what i can find out
who are they
oh christ dont you ever knock
who are they
you know there are certain civilities
when you enter a chaps place you know
the man who tried to kill me
well compositions nice
subject matters a touch macabre
find out who he is and who sent him
i can tell you who he is
his names alec drakos
greek national special ops
couple of tours of afghanistan
became a mercenary
ultimately a gun for hire
and i bet hes the chap
that shot you in slovenia
look at this better days
now on the plus side
a million dollars
will be wired to your account
plus my usual fee
and i will take care
of the finger business
mr rossi who has a liberal view
when it comes to bribery
caldwell what the fuck
are you talking about
right i forgot to tell you
each kill must be confirmed
by the receipt of a finger
to a postal box in paris
so listen to me
you are in now
i have accepted the job
i didnt accept anything
drakos was one of your contracts
good result only five to go
humor me who are the others
who are the others
you know the worst of the worst
backgrounds in espionage
in the military and crime of course
whats the thread
what do they have in common
which is
their occupation
they are assassins morgan like you
just let me get this right
ive been hired to assassinate assassins
and theyve been hired to kill me
and each other
fact is morgan they were coming for you
whether you accepted or not
but on the plus side
same odds even playing field
this isnt a fucking game
yes it is
to the person who set this up
this is a game
and if you want to live you have to play
here
morgan youve got this
anselm ryder
no no
a ruthless psychopath
signature move
collect a finger from the victim
a souvenir of sorts
pablo martinez
mr martinez is a poisoner
yuko
yuko is deadly with blades
and in close combat
the charming demir
is an opportunistic sociopath
hes locked up in a maximum security
prison in bosnia
finding him is simple
but access will be tricky
falk
now falk is a legend and problematic
no positive ids no photos no patterns
just a trail of bodies and cover ups
that are only possible
if falks working
from within the intelligence community
now each kill must be confirmed
by the receipt of a finger
to a postal box in paris
demir
who are you
what do you want
good news
youre being released today
pierre i have a gift for you
thanks inspector leon
welcome inspector leon
taking precautions i see
arent you
maat the egyptian goddess
of justice
my reminder to stay focused
a penthouse in an empty building in paris
how did you manage
i bought the building
drink
and when we say drink we mean vodka
im on duty
dont trust a man
who wont drink with you
thats what my uncle mariusz says
but consider the source
one assassins been killed
alec drakos
the responding officers bodycam
how did you get this
i hacked the video server
of the rome police
who killed him
we dont know
what about the others
still searching
these are very skilled people
aliases no digital traces
they avoid all patterns
i handed you detailed files
on all of them didnt i
so stop telling me things i know
and start telling me things i dont
six million dollars
your boss said that would lure them out
now where are they
her plan takes time
and youre not the only one
who needs to protect his back
one mistake
then dont make any
wake up
where am i
you received a package
box number 115 what do you know about it
who the fuck are you
were gonna play a very short game
you dont answer my questions
or you tell me some lies
ill blow your damn brains out
who are you and who do you work for
answer me
my name is leon
inspector french police
a finger arrives along with
the name of the person it was attached to
we publish a fake obituary in le monde
just to confirm receipt
within a few days
we receive a file detailing every single
assassination this person committed
and then
we open investigations into them
how were you first contacted
email anonymous untraceable
we simply followed the directions
and posted the first fake obituary
just to say yes
under what name
maat
maat what is that
maat we found it was
an egyptian goddess of truth and justice
she set the order of the universe right
after the chaos of its creation
and
and she weighs the hearts of the dead
just to see if theyre too heavy with evil
to reach paradise
what significance is that to you
i believe the message in the name
is perhaps for you
no
morgan gaines
were alive but not quite living
dead
but not yet in the grave
stuck in this halflife until it ends
when is that
do you really think
the last surviving assassin will just be
free to enjoy his newfound riches
no hell be hunted down too
unless
unless we help each other
find the person whos holding our strings
the puppet master
were all dancing to now and
and
kill him
performance wasnt bad
how long did you practice that for
he speaks
mr gaines
its in our mutual interest
to communicate
collaborate
we should share what we know
why dont you share first
im happy to
just give me an address
and a time youll be there
and ill tell you in person
we can share electronically
okeydokey sweetie
but youre taking all the fun out of it
he bled out like a pig
sure smelled like one too
so how about you send me
a photo of yourself now
no
but im sure
you smell better than poor demir
not gonna let you bleed out
i wanna see you try
well see out of the both of us
who bleeds out first
great man and his pride
confronting murderous men
a great man
as military snipers
we were taught when we lock onto a target
to whisper to ourselves
steady our breathing
release all consequence
and then squeeze the trigger
i used to recite this poem death
by william butler yeats
catchy title
i think were being told something here
the money was most likely
put up by a client
who had hired all of us in the past
were from different countries
our hits spread all over the world
exactly
we took out our marks
using different methods
i mean nothing would point to one person
doing all of these hits
now he wants to silence us
maybe but why not just hire
one of us to kill us all
why now
why go after assassins that arent active
demir
hed been in prison
for the last four years
i think theyre trying to make a point
were meant to feel
the consequences of what weve done
what its like to be targeted
heres my number
its a secure line
we make a great team
in fact heres a little
parting gift for you
its pablo martinezs location
bye morgan
i can tell you who he is
his names alec drakos
special ops couple tours of afghanistan
greek national
they are assassins morgan like you
christ not again
what would be so terribly wrong
with ringing the buzzer
when i was targeting lesek in slovenia
you knew those six contracts
were already running didnt you
my computer was hacked was that you
your phone records show that you called
alec drakos in slovenia
after you spoke to me
again in turino
you lied about his profile
he was exroyal marines like me
sniper recon division just like me
no friends no family
grew up in foster care
like me
you lied about everything
i think youve got this terribly wrong
you were his handler too
you fed him his intel
you told him he could
pick up the lesek contract
if he got rid of me first didnt you
morgan this only works
if we completely
you told him my location
you sent him to fucking kill me
bullet came this close to my head
this close to sophies head
bring back memories
better days as you put it
morgan calm down
okay drakos worked for me as well
but it was the game
that set you up against each other
there was no other way
and choosing between you
its like choosing between your children
but you did choose
and you chose him
no listen to me listen to me
of course i set this up between you
i had to there was no choice
but i did so
in the full and certain knowledge
that you would win
you were never going to lose to drakos
youre the best morgan
youre the gold standard
bullshit
was it always about the money for you
did any of my kills actually deserve it
all of them each one
once you see the lies
you see the liar too
the number to my burner phone
that only you knew
was compromised by falk
i gave her nothing
her
so youre saying
you actually know this woman
your arrogance made you careless
you traitor
she knows who you are
she broke into your records just as i did
up until now
its just been the means
to get close to me
but once she runs out of her patience
shes gonna come looking for you
and have much more of a handson approach
youre gonna wish
i put a fucking bullet in your head
morgan im sorry
listen you can do this
we can do this
weve been through so much together
you were like a father to me
i taught you everything i know
theres nothing fucking left
welcome to the game
mr gaines
tell me about your end
6 million for the contracts
their money is in an offshore account
that traces to kyiv ukraine
now if look at all our hits tied to kyiv
you will find a common theme
they are all linked to gas pipelines
which is a billiondollar industry
mariusz ilych
his company has been awarded every major
construction project for the past decade
because we got rid
of anyone standing in his way
including his own brother yakov
now he considers us loose ends
maybe his niece jonna
discovered what her uncle did
now if she traced her uncles payments
to all of us
but didnt know which assassin
killed her daddy
she could have set us up
against each other
pablo martinez a bit of an anomaly
never uses a gun prefers poison
nor dread nor hope attend
a dying animal
no kills for 10 years
disappeared after that
been off the grid ever since
a man awaits his end
dreading and hoping all
hes a lone wolf no wife
many times he died
no kids
many times he rose again
oh my god yes
give me a kiss
okay now you can come with me but i
fuck
drop the ax
drop the fucking ax turn around
slowly
easy
that girl in there is that your daughter
wheres the mother
breast cancer two years ago
just the two of you here alone
take anything
do whatever you want to me
but my daughter shes only four please
were you offered contracts recently
answer the fucking question
i dont know what it is i dont know
tell me what date it is today
today may 5th
you kill people for a living
i know exactly who you are
so you dont fucking lie to me
otherwise may 5th is gonna
go down in your daughters memory
as the last day she saw her daddy alive
i killed one person
eight years ago
and the nightmares only left me
after my daughter was born
what about that job tell me about it
daddy you said 10 minutes for ice cream
yes honey daddys coming
please
wanna color
im fine
maybe next picture i do a lot
you do
whichever cup you want
tell me about the last job of yours
where was it
in prague
i botched it
slipped thallium sulfate in his coffee
but the dosage was too weak
hospital for 18 days
his hair fell out
he lost almost 100 pounds
and he got a hole in his throat
to help him breathe
i went to the hospital
sat in the chapel
im not sure
if i was praying for him or myself
after that i disappeared
i was done
daddy why are you sad
no honey
dad is just telling a sad story
okay
you just give me as many details
as you remember
somebodys pit us against each other
i want to find out why and who
he must know
youll come for him in the end
yeah you can bet on that
do you mind
blues my favorite color
but its okay if you use it
thank you
its my favorite color too
honey do you want more milk
can i have more milk please
yes
you need to stay away from the windows
you might not
have received those contracts
but theres still
a milliondollar bounty on your head
do you have a gun
ive got a home phone
less than 10 people have the number
and they all live within 20 miles
i dont use my real name
ive gone as far from my past as i can
well your past has caught up with you
theyre coming
yuko
yuko is a martial arts master
most feared for her blade work
and she has
perhaps some lingering daddy issues
now if her mark is a woman
she makes a clean strike to her heart
but if its a man
she prefers to cut him open
evisceration
her only weakness
she dresses very light no armor
so if you can manage it
a single bullet to the chest
ought to put her to rest
are you okay
what took you so long
thank you
its for your own good
daddy daddy whats happening
come here come here come here
one bullet my ass
dont worry
oh shit
death has come to call
im afraid so
its been a long time
since i heard your voice falk
or should i call you vicky
dont call me that
will my death be painful
its a warm feeling like a soft blanket
just let it pass over and youll sleep
how very kind
how long do i have
about an hour
the fact that im not already dead
leads me to believe
that you need something else from me
what is it
morgan gaines i want his file and mine
you already have his file
you hacked my computer
well i have the official file
i want the personal
the one that you keep
vicky
dont call me that
you seem to forget im dying
why should i give you anything
because of this
the antidote
i dont believe that for a second
believe it or not i dont care
but if you want to live
all right well let me think about this
meantime i think
ill fix myself a drink and
perhaps youd like to join me
we could have a good chat
please sit
sit down
youll take that seat sit right here
as you wish
you cant blame me for trying
i dont blame you
i dont blame you for anything
the past is the past
now give me what i need
so here it is your file encrypted
who else has seen this
no one
not even morgan
no
as far as hes concerned
youre an enigma and a mystery
gone
now
morgan please
this girl this woman
she is bright she is kind
and she knows nothing
and shes nothing to you
so i should let her live
a little bit sentimental for you
im dying falk
dying can bring out
the sentimental in a man
morgans my protégé just as you were
and whatever you think
im not gonna betray him
you betrayed him before
not this time
so if you dont mind
you might just let an old man
rest his tired eyes
and enjoy whats left of the evening
have it your way old man
look what you did
you
just lost the privilege
of a peaceful death
pick up caldwell
can i speak to signor chivasso please
whos this
morgan gaines
mom killed at age four dad gave you up
foster care kind of unpleasant
i dont need my fucking history
ive lived through it
royal marine sniper
taken under the wing of ian caldwell
who offered you the chance
to kill evil men for your government
except it wasnt always
for your government
and the men werent always evil
youre a monster falk
or should i call you agent vos
well caldwell that snake
did you know that he lied to you
that he changed marks background
exaggerated their crimes
omitted that they had children
people that loved them
just like i assumed you loved your mom
times running out
after i kill ryder youre next
do you think that caldwell
was trying to ease your conscience
you think youre a good man
dont you morgan
youre just a slave to your emotions
thats where were different
cause im free
you want to get
to whos behind this or not
my condolences by the way for caldwell
we all hope for a death without suffering
in his case
it simply was impossible
such a shame though
i want to believe
that theres at least one person honest
well at least you still have sophie
shes real cute
ryder will take care of her
you got good taste
hey you i cant talk right now
sophie you need to do exactly what i say
can i call you back i was just
theres someone coming for you
you need to get to a safe house
get rid of your phone
that can be tracked
the address is 105 via roma
apartment 42d
what do you mean someones coming for
sophie
fuck
theres an active shooter
at arcabaleno school
you need to hurry
okay were on our way
sophie sophie
are you hurt
tell me what the fuck is going on
okay you deserve the truth
when i was younger i joined the military
i thought it was a just cause
i thought i was doing my part for society
well it turns out theres
a lot of red tape behind saving lives
i need to show you something
after i left the royal marines
i met a man named caldwell
he became like a mentor to me
introduced me to this world
he acted like a mediator between clients
these clients wanted people dead
bad people
murderers rapists corrupt officials
over the years i became numb
it all became meaningless
until you came into my life
you changed everything
you showed me a life
that i thought i didnt deserve
now i need to fight to protect you
because i love you sophie
im pregnant
i leave tomorrow
go to my mother for a few weeks in lisbon
then ill be back to my job to my life
so whatever this is you make it stop
you leave tonight
so
there are two this time
two from the same person
nope there is a mans finger
and a womans finger
what did you get yourself into old boy
why is that you chose the hard way out
jesus christ
certainly wasnt loved as a kid
everything clear yeah
we know who were dealing with
shoot to kill
lets go
we just got confirmation
from the satellite footage
ryder and morgan are here
dont worry jonna
the nightmare stops today
were gonna get him
okay
i will take you to the airport
laced with strychnine
very fatal and extremely fucking painful
why dont you take a seat
its quite the collection you have here
somewhat of a signature
for you now isnt it
i bet if i dig deep enough
im gonna find yakov ilychs finger
i dont know that person
dont fucking lie to me
good thing about strychnine is
it doesnt fuck with your brain
so youre gonna know
when every single muscle in your body
contracts simultaneously
the pain only intensifying
with the slightest of stimulation
thats where i come in
now give my fucking answers
and ill put you
out of your fucking misery
because she got to you too

yakovs daughter jonna ilych
supports her uncle mariusz
in his campaign
there will be a formal celebration
tomorrow in prague
thank you maxim
you are done for today you can go
you forgot something
dont move
nice to meet you jonna
or should i call you maat
maat i dont know this person
of course you do
you set up this game for vengeance
but in fact it was your uncle
who killed your father
no he paid someone like you to do that
just like you paid a group of us
to kill each other
six million dollars buys a lot of bodies
i dont
that money was to stop my uncle
and to arrest all of you
arrest us
how
my uncle kept me close to control me
made me part of the machine helping him
a mass murderer
seized power over an entire country
he liked to parade me out
the poor orphan he saved
but if i questioned him
he would have
taken out a contract on me too
thats how he solved problems
i was helping them to end this
helping who
agents
which agents
jonna ilych agent vos
im taking over the investigation
inspector leon you report directly to me
so is everything on here
yes as much as i could gather
on my uncles circle of assassins
targets money transfers
he kept encrypted records of everything
what about him falk
do you have anything else on him
his real name or
no he covers his tracks really well
we have nothing on him
have you shown this to anyone else
no
i am really sorry about your father
if we had enough money as bait
we could offer a contract
to each of the assassins
and then create some imaginary bait
for them to kill
lure them out of the shadows
and capture them
how much money would you need
the lead investigator
do you know who she was
agent vos
not the name she gave you who she was
you handed those files over to falk
thats the woman that killed your father
no
no
once you did that
she couldnt risk being exposed
so she had to get rid of the evidence
that meant your uncle
the assassins he hired and you
so she created a deadly game
that she could manipulate
from behind the agency
even used leon
fed him the exact lies to tell us
but thats not
my fathers finger was cut off
falk mirrors methods of other assassins
she was mimicking ryder
to throw off the investigators
everything shes done
has led to either trying to kill me
or for me to stand here and kill you
what about the money where is it
gone
the agency has no record of it
or any meeting we ever had
so the money never went to anyone
falk kept the money
i got word from the agency
only an hour ago
they told me agent vos is dead now
she was on a mission in italy
and apparently had a heart attack
sophie
its just me its okay
is it over
i hope so
i dont like that answer
oh god what did they do to you
its okay its okay
ill heal
listen i cant stay for long
where are you going
i have to go back to the apartment
i have to get some clothes
i need you to do me a favor
you keep the door closed
if youre thinking about disappearing
i dont want that
we stay together
you promised me
its a girl
our daughter
stupid kid
morgan you know your biggest mistake
you want to live
not just survive
but live
love care
it makes you vulnerable
it makes you weak
if you got a shot youd better take it
no
youre gonna suffer first
just like me
how did you put it
feel the consequences
of what youve done
we have unfinished business
one last contract unfulfilled
youre going to kill yourself
this conversations over
you and me know better than anyone
that every life has a price
and i know yours
you better run fast
you dont want to miss this show
leon falk is still alive she has sophie
i need you now
im sending you an address be there
sophie
sophie
id be still if i were you
if you move your leg from that wire
youre gonna blow up
i guess weve got
a little bit less than five minutes left
give me your gun
come on give me your gun
fuck
good boy
so we got one last game to play
the games done its over youve won
let her go theres nothing more
so heres the spin
thats a countdown to disarm
so in about four minutes youll be safe
but sophie would have drowned
so you got a decision to make
either you watch
the mother of your unborn child die
or you let the bomb go off
and you all die together
which is romantic
whatever choice you make i win you lose
the game is mine
so do you know if its a boy or a girl
have you thought about a name
cause i think falk is pretty cute
