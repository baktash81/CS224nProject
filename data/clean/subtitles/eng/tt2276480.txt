as so many do  in a doctor s office 
  you re 100  sure  doc 
  well  in my line of work 
nothing s 100   but i m sure 
oh  we re having a boy 
   narrator  which led to
one name being settled on 
a very popular name  as it turned out 
max 
i didn t do it 
not you 
max 
he bit me first 
no  max kuftinec 
coming  ms  winter 
and in china  it s considered
polite to burp when you eat 
it shows you like the food 
cool 
gross 
max  your father is
picking you up early today 
get your things ready 
yes  ms  winter 
max  it s been nice
having you in my class 
i ll be back tomorrow  ms  winter 
hey  we re just checking it out  okay 
no decisions yet 
obviously max is very bright 
what can you tell me about her
that her test scores can t  hmm 
well  uh  max has always been   
she s been a self starter ever since   
   narrator  sarah felt
foolish reducing their daughter
to a bunch of words that
a thousand other parents
must have said about their kids 
we can t describe what s
so great about max 
you know  any more than i can tell you
what s great about the color blue 
but you would be lucky to have her 
what do we do 
i don t know 
she s happy now 
i know 
and even with the scholarship 
we would still have to come up
with at least another couple thousand 
that s just this year 
well  i could ask for a raise 
they just gave you one 
i could ask for a raise 
they owe me one 
i guess my first question is why 
i mean  i like ps 41 
and you always tell me how lucky we are
to have a great local public school 
yes  and that s true 
but you re the smartest kid
in your class right now  right 
maybe 
well  maybe it would
be good to be somewhere
where you weren t the smartest kid 
someone s gotta be 
i know  max 
i know 
who knows how far you could go in life 
we just want to give you
every opportunity to do that 
right  and ultimately 
this is your decision 
mm hmm 
but papa and i think this
would be very good for you 
and if you don t like it  you
can always go back to ps 41 
that s right 
okay 
so how would i get there 
okay  well  you would take the subway 
and papa would go with you 
when i can 
hang on a sec 
what do you mean   when i can  
i can t be late to the
restaurant every day 
no  i m not talking every day 
i m talking a couple times a week 
well  how    this is not
what we talked about 
it is what   
i told you   
look  look  look 
i ll just go alone when
papa can t take me 
it s fine 
it s fine 
i walk to ps 41 by myself 
i take care of jez by myself 
i m not a baby anymore 
   narrator  tom lay in bed that night
wondering if they d
made the right decision 
sarah wondered if she
was a good parent or not 
max wondered what the
library would be like
at the blackstone academy 
jez slept 
i m going to a new school today 
really 
yes 
i m not a baby anymore 
if i don t see my daughter 
at least i get to see
my granddaughter  huh 
it s your fault  yaya 
fault  how 
you were such a good cook that
you made mama into a chef 
you re a tricky one  matia mou 
your brains you get from your
mother  not from that one 
go round and round 
yaya s got no energy today 
come on  tea 
let s get some tea 
so  this new school  it s better  right 
you know   
they re smart  they take you 
i don t know 
i think it ll be good  but   
 speaking in foreign language

cold  tea ice cold 
i m sorry 
i ll heat it up for you 
in greece  never serve
tea like that  never 
but it was steaming in your   
maxine  you don t contradict yayas 
maybe they teach you
that in your new school 
but i didn t   
eh 
what i tell you all your life 
if you make a mistake  admit it 
right  so 
i apologize  yaya 
good 
you re not a baby anymore  matia mou 
you must make your own decisions 
like my yaya said 
 you don t let life happen to you 
you happen to life  
sounds better in greek 
hi 
hey 
they re all freaked out about something 
they said the last thing they
could do is give me a raise 
so what do we do 
i don t know 
we could take out a loan 
not with our credit 
well  we could borrow money from somebody 
from who 
you want to go door to door
in the building 
ask people to loan money to the super 
you gotta get real here  tom 
i m gonna take extra shifts 
no 
there s no other option 
i love you so much 
there s nobody who s loved more than you
in this whole world 
you hear me 
i mean  there might be some
people loved as much as you 
but nobody is loved   
i know  dad 
now go away 
i hate it when you need them
more than they need you 
laura langer 
you re new here 
tom kuftinec 
you ll be happy here 
it s a great place 
and 40  of graduates go
to ivy league schools 
not that we re thinking
about that kind of thing yet 
heh 
   narrator  a new routine was soon set 
tom would drop max off in the morning 
and she would come home
by herself after school 
can t let things get you down 
listen  things will get better 
no  but i m telling you it s    watch it 
no  it s a totally great show 
you have to watch it

the chess club then 
there are other girls
there with your skills 
but i don t know how to play chess 
that s okay

i was the third best math
student in the class 
now i m the fourth 
and who might you be

let s see how smart you are now 
go ahead  you re white 
oh  my god

one day  i m going to come back here 
and i m going to teach you some manners 
yeah  well  good luck with that 
what happened 
why did she leave 
to be honest  mr  eckhard 
i don t think she liked you very much 
i m sorry 
hey  kids

becky langer 
sophie glass 
isabella diaz 
max kuftinec 
she s has a boy s first
name and a stupid last name 
i know it s hard to do 
but sometimes you gotta
take a chance  man 
yeah  i know 
no  you should go for it 
it can t take too long to learn  can it 
i ve always wanted to
learn another language 
just find the right guy 
pick the one you want to learn from 
all the little league coaches are good 
go away 
you re still here 
fine  let s play 
i ll let you win 
for a while 
costs five bucks 
i don t know how to play chess 
and i don t usually talk to strangers 
not talking to strangers is smart 
but not playing chess  that s just stupid 
what s 25 times 14 
something tells me i m about to find out 
350  i m not stupid 
fine 
but you re  like  what  six years old 
and you don t know how to play chess yet 
what kind of crappy school you go to 
i want to learn how to play 
and i m not 6  i m 10 
when i was 10  i was
carrying blocks of ice
up 5 flights of stairs 
i don t think that s possible
unless you re  like  90 
fine  my father did that  not me 
but i certainly knew how to
play chess when i was 10 
hell  i won the city
tournament when i was 10 
why don t you use that google 
i hear it can teach you anything 
i don t know 
i just had a feeling you
might be able to teach me 
plus you re two blocks from my house 
and you seem to have some free time 
well  kid  you gotta play for something 
any city kid knows that 
and these days  i play for money 
hmph 
fashion show

fine 
hey  how s that new
fancy pants school of yours 
no way it s better than ps 41 
i don t think it s better 
but it s different 
are the kids smarter 
no  but they re more the same 
of course they are 
they re all girls 
yeah  but   
they re all the same kind of girls 
hey  look  it s little orphan annie 
annie  i d like you to meet my friend mel 
except he s not really a friend of mine 
and his name s not really mel 
i got my allowance early 
scram 
i was winning 
bull oney  you were winning 
i was six moves from checkmating you 
i was four moves from checkmating you 
oh  you couldn t beat me
if i gave you a bullwhip and jake lamotta 
i ve been beating that guy
since before you were born 
that s not very long 
okay  since before your father was born 
you got an answer for everything 
most things 
great 
lucky for you i love kids so much 
okay 
let s get started 
what do you know about chess 
not much 
do you know how the different pieces move 
not really 
do you know what each piece is called 
not precisely 
not precisely 
do you know anything about chess 
i know it s a good game for smart people 
now that is the first sensible
thing i ve heard you say 
okay 
this is called a pawn 
it s barely worth the space it occupies 
a lot like a kid 
like a kid  a pawn can t move very fast 
only one space at a time 
except for its first move 
when it can go two 
like a kid  excited at first  then lazy 
lucky for me you love kids so much 
you re a cocky kid 
where d you say you re from 
over there  in the village 
i grew up in brooklyn 
now brooklyn s a place yuppies move to 
i didn t think there
were any city kids left 
what are you talking about 
there are lots of city 
just living in the city
doesn t make you a city kid 
these kids might as
well be in westchester 
their nannies take  em everywhere 
a city kid  he s cocky 
but not too cocky 
knows how to play things 
and a city kid sees the
way it all goes together 
you know what i m talking about 
i think so 
well  we ll find out 
you know why all the best players
are city kids 
no 
because they re used to
different kinds of people
bumping into each other every day
in different ways  always changing 
just like a chessboard 
what do you mean 
for instance  i already told
you pawns are like kids 
so this pawn is you 
you just started a new school 
so you move forward 
how d you know i started a new school 
your fancy new duds 
and you don t look very
comfortable in  em 
only  you re not sure
about this new school 
so you only go one square
forward instead of two 
once you take your hand off
the piece  your move is done 
it s my turn 
i m playing against you 
you re not playing yet 
you re just moving the pieces 
come back tomorrow 
one move a day is plenty 
one move a day 
come on 
go 
okay  class  open to page 41  geography 
today we re talking about
the united states of america 
but we re talking about
all of the americas 
which includes 
hold on just one second 
hi 
hi  yes 
go away  go away 
go away  go away 
go away  go away 
go away 
thank god 
max  your father wants you to
wait for him here after class 
class 
girls  enough 
let s get back to the lesson  okay 
you know  my bedroom window s stuck 
maybe your dad can come
over later and fix it 
maxie 
it s yaya 
hi 
listen  honey  i know
you re having a tough time 
but it ll get better 
i promise 
i was just thinking about
how things always change  you know 
i was thinking about how we re all born 
and then we get older and older  until   
i can t stop thinking about it 
i see 
well  you know i m always
gonna be here for you 
and mama s always gonna be here for you 
not always 
as long as you need us  we ll be here 
i m gonna sit over there for a bit
if that s okay with you 
all right 
that s right 
another kid s coming at you 
what do you mean 
this is you  right 
you ve stepped out on your own 
out onto an island a little bit 
and you could move further on your own 
but that d be stupid  right 
even you can see that 
so you take your best friend 
bring her up next to you 
i don t have a best friend 
then any friend you
have at that new school 
i don t have any 
you don t have any 
then you better get some 
you can t win a chess
game with just one piece 
well  there s my little sister 
that s pathetic 
but you gotta move something 
not that your little sis can
help you much over there 
look  your board is your city 
and your city is your board 
you understand 
no 
never mind 
that s enough for today 
get out of here 
you can t just keep
moving your little sister 
well  i m thinking about
going back to my old school 
i have friends there 
they kicking you out of
that fancy new place 
no  i just don t know if
it s the right school for me 
so you re just gonna quit
before you give it a fair chance 
right 
that s a great idea 
you re behind  so you should quit now 
i didn t say i was quitting 
thinking about quitting
is the same as quitting 
maybe you should just go
play checkers instead 
they play a lot of
checkers in westchester 
did you ever notice that miss
bailes looks like a walrus 
heh  not before 
but now i won t be able to
observe her without laughing 
thanks a lot 
that s becky 
she s got my back 
one final thing about pawns 
if a pawn manages to do something great 
if it gets all the way to the other side 
then it changes  turns into a queen 
so a worthless little kid
can turn into a queen 
interesting 
don t get too excited 
it almost never happens 
okay  now that you re actually
moving more than one piece 
you gotta think strategically 
strategically 
yeah  you need a plan 
when you walk out the door 
you have a plan  right 
you don t just walk outside
and wander around  do you 
uh  no 
no 
so  what s your plan 
um   
to move me and my friends forward 
all right 
i guess that s a plan  barely 
but you gotta keep an eye on the board 
come up with a new plan if things change 
but things always change 
that s right 
things always change 
so what do you do about that 
i mean  what if you don t
want things to change 
tough 
forget it 
i don t know why i would ask you 
hey  listen 
change isn t a bad thing 
sometimes it is 
man  when was the last
time we had a date night 
i don t know  1998 
oh  it feels that way  doesn t it 
it probably has been a year 
that s so bad 
no  it s not bad 
we re busy 
yeah  everybody s busy  but you make time
for the things that are important 
and  you know  i can certainly
take a night off every six months 
you re not worried about
the babysitter  are you 
no  no  no  no 
she s fine 
come on 
okay 
i told you not to move 
you re a closet 
closets don t move 
she s right 
closets don t move 
dad 
mom 
are you asleep 
why don t you answer 
yaya 
shh 
don t wake up your sister 
go back to sleep 
but you re dead 
tell me something i don t know 
what are you doing here 
sitting with you 
what  that s a problem 
uh  no  no 
i got no other plans 
and i gotta keep an eye
on that lazy father of yours 
he s not lazy 
well    heh 
go back to sleep 
yaya 
still here 
you know  if you were
anyone else sitting there 
i d be pretty scared right now 
i mean  you re dead 
that would be really scary 
to have a dead person sitting in my room 
mm  yes  that would be really scary 
so are you a ghost 
no  no  no 
you know better than that 
i m just a pigment of your imagination 
i always thought the word was  figment  
maxine  you don t correct yayas 
okay 
well  good night  yaya 
good night  matia mou 
  tic  tac  toe  
  gimme an x  gimme an o  
  gimme a three in a row  
  row  ship  boat  
hey  that s weird 
look at olive 
yeah 
why isn t she with the rest
of her catastrophic friends 
go over and talk to her 
why 
you go over and talk to her if you want 
no  you do it 
you re prettier than me 
she ll like you better 
okay 
tell her you like her drawings 
she s proud of them 
cool 
cool animals 
so  any ideas on your move 
why do you seem so excited today 
you re never excited 
because i see a piece
that s been left out
alone to fend for itself 
so what are you gonna do 
becky s gonna take it
like she took olive 
wow 
downtown 
i ve been downtown 
like  twice in my life 
what s it like down there 
it must be mesmerizing 
it s nice 
i mean  it s a little
busier than it is up here 
i wish i lived downtown 
and i cannot believe your parents
let you ride home on
the subway by yourself 
that is totally scintillating 
i guess 
there s no way my mom
would let me do that 
i m not allowed on the
streets without a grown up 
and she won t let me
ride the subway at all 
you ve never been on the subway 
nobody i know gets to ride the subway 
so do you want to come over to my place
with your nanny on friday 
uh  why don t we go somewhere fun instead 
home is so boring 
yeah  that s a stunning idea 
your nanny can take us
and drop me off at home
when we re done 
uh  my nanny s no fun 
she doesn t do anything 
it s got to be your nanny 
okay 
becky 
gotta go 
your dad has a nice car 
dad 
you re funny 
the rook 
also known as a castle 
cool 
a good piece  useful piece 
now go learn about it 
what are you talking about 
go out there 
find a castle 
learn how the piece moves 
let me get this straight 
to learn how this piece
moves on a chessboard 
i m supposed to go look around
new york city for a castle 
right 
and somehow that s going
to teach me something 
yeah  if you got your eyes open 
look  you can learn my way 
or you can learn from somebody else 
well  can you at least give me a hint
about what i m looking for 
a hint 
you mean  like  is it
bigger than a bread box 
bigger than an xbox 
what s an xbox 
what s a bread box 
oh  get out of here 
xbox 
it s gonna take a little imagination 
do you have a little imagination 
i m a 10 year old girl 
what do you think 
then stop being so literal 
chess player needs to think creatively 
and don t come back till you find it 
you need to be inspired 
inspired 
sweetie  i am sorry 
but we just can t do it 
and i gotta get back to work  so kiss 
come on 
just one day 
honey  we can t afford a nanny 
we just can t 
don t you want me to have playdates 
or would you rather i just be a hermit
for the rest of my life 
of course we want you to have playdates 
well  other parents don t let their kids
walk the streets alone 
look  it s great that you trust me 
this isn t about you 
i can t have a playdate without a nanny 
okay  here s an idea 
what if my sister picked you up one day 
she said she d be happy to
do it if we ever needed her 
no  no one has their aunt pick them up 
that s so uncool 
what do you care what people think 
that doesn t matter 
dad  i m 10 years old 
it matters 
i need a nanny to pick me up 
not my aunt diane 
why can t aunt diane be your nanny 
are you sure your nanny
is coming today  max 
you could always just
come over to our house 
oh  no  she s definitely coming 
she s very reliable 
mom  you don t have to remain here 
i m sorry  honey 
i know it s embarrassing to you 
but i don t let my
daughter walk the streets
with someone i haven t met 
hey  max 
come on 
you have to be my nanny 
oh  yeah  i heard  so i m not your aunt 
i m just your nanny 
got it 
and you can t be american 
nannies are never american 
unless they re young dancers 
i ve got a dancer s body 
they re in their 20s 
i ve got a dancer s body  okay 
this is my nanny  diane 
hi  diane

um    ahem 
so  diane 
where do you take the girls today 
uh  i take girls 
eh  wherever they want to go 
except if it not safe 
then i do not take them 
excuse me one second

call me at the first sign of trouble 
 upbeat music 
i mean  can you believe it 
you know  i can t believe he d do it 
i still have to throw things out 
he s watching the
decluttering show  i guess 
oh  i gotta refill my metrocard 
i forgot my wallet

jeez 
your mom s going to kill me 
okay 
my student metrocard can be
used once every 17 minutes 
so we ll just wait for that 
no  i m not gonna use your
student metrocard  okay 
that s illegal 
come on 
no one s watching 
they have cameras everywhere 
there aren t any cameras here 
no  they disguise them  see 
you can t trust  em 
you don t realize that 
you didn t live through the  60s 
neither did you 
come on already 
no  put that away 
okay  then ask for some money 
excuse me 
this is ridiculous 
excuse me 
my aunt needs to borrow a couple dollars 
you should be ashamed of yourself 
bringing your little girl out here to beg 
disgraceful 
i could ve taken the subway by myself 
i do it every day 
no  not when i m supposed
to be watching you 
i d never hear the end of it 
 diane  just  cause you
decided not to have kids
doesn t mean you can just    
what 
inspired 
what 
it s a castle 
heh 
no  that s a church 
you don t have much of an imagination 
this is strange 
yeah 
i m going to move him to here 
then next turn  i can capture the pawn 
good 
now i want you to learn
how to move the knight 
listen  norman  this has been 
uh  interesting 
but you could save us both some time
by just telling me how 
i could teach you all the
rules of chess in two minutes 
but the rules are nothing 
what s important is how you see the board 
now tell me about the rook 
it sweeps across the
board in straight lines 
see  i m teaching you how
to see the whole board 
not just a single piece 
anybody can move a piece 
takes a city kid to make sense
of what seems like chaos 
and i could tell you
that this is a good move 
but you would learn absolutely nothing 
is it better to earn five bucks
or to find it in the street 
finding it in the street would be okay 
especially if it kept
me from running around
like a crazy person 
you re not a crazy person 
you re a weird person 
like most good chess players 
i m not a good chess player 
not yet  but you might be someday
if you learn my way 
i gotta admit that was a pretty cool way
to learn about the rook 
how did you do that  anyway 
eh 
so tell me about the knight 
an unusual piece 
moves very strangely 
how 
your board  your city 
so what am i supposed to do 
go look for a knight or a horse 
figure it out yourself 
that s the whole point 
don t let life happen to you 
you happen to life 
now get out of here 
scram 
 upbeat music 
you look like a knight 
okay 
can i ask you a question 
yeah  her name s andromeda 
who 
it s the horse 
that s what you were gonna ask me  right 
um  no 
i wanted to ask how you  uh  move 
how i move 
yeah 
do you have a special way you move 
i don t know what you re
talking about  kid 
right 
well  sorry 
max  that would ve been too easy 
but here s a clue 
you look for horses that really move 
hey  bug  stop running back and forth 
you know how much mr 
shawn downstairs hates it 
hey  bug 
do you want us all to go to jail 
kids don t go to jail 
papa  they go to juvie 
30 000 
what s that  a math problem 
sort of 
how long do you think it would take
to count to 30 000  papa 
i don t know 
couple hours  maybe  why 
because that s how many days
an average person lives 30 000 
that s it 
and i ve already used up 
like 4 000 days  almost 
maxie  i   
i don t know what to tell you  honey 
nothing  papa 
nothing 
papa 
yeah  maxie 
where are those horses racing 
oh  that s from today s races at aqueduct 
where s aqueduct 
it s in queens 
this is ridiculous 
look  i asked you because i thought
you wouldn t be scared to do this 
if you want to go back 
please  don t play your
fourth grade mind games on me 
let s go 
so what s happening at ps 41 these days 
same as usual 
oh  uh  there s a new gym teacher 
coach z left 
yeah 
and  uh  the new gym teacher s a girl 
wow  that s cool 
no  it s lame 
whoever heard of a girl gym teacher 
oh  and the chess team
just finished second
at city championships 
really 
maybe i ll play against them someday 
heh 
they ll kick your butt 
they re good 
i said i was sorry 
could have made us some fake ids 
i m sorry 
i didn t realize you
had to be 18 to get in 
well  will you at least tell
me now why we came here 
we came to watch the horses 
of course we came here
to watch the horses 
why 
to see how they move 
what direction 
they move around the track in a circle 
well  it s not exactly a circle 
okay  an oval 
please don t tell me that s
all you needed to know 
only  1 00 
get it here 
get it now 
get it while it s still on
ice  ladies and gentlemen 
so  moving in an oval 
you know  some people might
think it was a bad idea
to send a 10 year old kid to a racetrack 
i didn t send you to a racetrack 
you sent yourself 
it s a small horse 
you have to make a small oval 
think of a horse in the city 
it can t cut through a block 
it s gotta make turns at the corner 
try going a different way 
okay  i got it 
what s next 
i want to see your diarrhea 
you mean diary 
mmm  macaroni and dirt  my favorite 
not macaroni and dirt 
papa  macaroni and cheese 
mm mm mm  i saw mama
cooking it this morning 
and this is definitely macaroni and dirt 
you re silly  papa 
papa  why doesn t mama eat
dinner with us anymore 
because mama s gotta work  bug 
what s mama s work 
i ve told you before 
bug  she cooks for people 
she cooks for us 
why does she have to cook
for other people  too 
well  it s complicated  honey 
it s not that complicated 
jez  other people give her
money to cook for them 
unless you have any money to give her 
she can t just cook for you 
i have some money 
no  you don t 
yes  i do 
i have a nickel and a penny and a dollar 
that s not real money 
that s just like 
jesus  max  stop 
yeah  max  cheeses 
hey  hey  both of you 
the important thing is
that both of you girls know
that your mama loves you more
than anything in the world  okay 
and when you eat the food
that she cooks for you 
it s like you re eating her love 
that s kinda gross 
i m not hungry anymore 
okay 
you re ready 
make your own move  any piece you like 
are we going to play 
no  we re just going to work on openings 
just the first five moves 
but i m ready to play a real game 
i know how to move all the pieces 
fine  if you re ready to play a real game 
then you don t need me anymore 
i know how to drive a car 
doesn t mean i m ready for the indy 500 
what do i move first 
what are you  two years old 
pick a piece  and move it 
brilliant move 
people will be talking
about it for decades 
now  we already talked about
the earth and the moon  right 
the sun is 4 5 billion years old 
know what else is 4 5 billion years old 
what 
those shoes 
hey  do you want do some
more exploring today 
well  i kinda have to play chess today 
i can play chess 
for real 
like  can you play well 
no  but i can play a little 
great  will your mom let you come 
i told her your ludicrous
nanny was picking us up 
i don t think that word means
what you think it means 
you ever think about
how random things are 
i mean  isabella could
have been my best friend
instead of you 
i doubt that 
what i m saying is that everything in life
is just   
i don t know  luck 
those people could have been my parents 
that could have been my grandmother 
or i might have had two dads
and maybe lived somewhere else 
for that matter  i could have been a boy 
eww 
i mean  why is your name becky 
because rebecca is too long and boring 
what s your point 
nothing  come on 
great 
two six year olds 
that should equal one 12 year old 
we re not six years 
don t bother 
here s how i m starting today 
pawn to e3 
almost as earthshaking
as your last opening 
e3 
that s how you describe moves 
the squares go across from a to h 
and the squares up and
down go from 1 to 8 
so that square is e3 
hey  i m impressed 
you can count to eight 
just ignore him 
not terrible 
actually  not terrible 
papa 
max 
max 
hey 
come on  maxie 
talk to me 
did you know that the sun
is 4 5 billion years old
and that in another 5 billion
years  it ll burn out 
i don t think we need to
worry about that  honey 
why not 
because we won t be here 
but where will i be  dad 
where will i be in 5 billion years 
i don t know  honey 
but i can promise you one thing 
wherever you are  i m gonna be there  too 
huh 
how  bout a little beard scratch 
heh 
dad 
yeah  honey 
i wish i didn t think about these things 
i know  honey 
i think about  em sometimes  too 
but you know when i never do 
when i m with you and your sister 
that must mean something  right 
good night  sweetie 
hey 
hey 
what s going on 
i told him we could only
play the first five moves 
but he wouldn t stop 
we ll stop when i m ahead 
it doesn t look like that
is ever gonna happen 
scram 
scram 
come on 
all right 
we re gonna play the first 20 moves each 
try not to lose before then 
hello 
hey 
how were the girls 
oh  fine 
do you remember when max was born 
like five minutes ago 
i remember three minutes
ago  when jez was born 
they re closing the restaurant 
when 
it s already done 
you know  apparently
they ve been losing money 
but they offered me a
job at their other place 
in boston 
no  no  no  you could get a
job at another restaurant here 
there s nothing out there 
you know how many people
were coming in every day
looking for work 
it s just 
we are really lucky they
offered me this boston gig 
well  then you could not
work for a while  then 
yeah  so we can not pay
max s tuition for a while 
i know how to rotate my schedule 
i can come back twice a month 
the chinese bus is only  15 
they need me to start next week 
well  you thought of everything then 
are you mad at me 
you think i want to do this 
you know  i think you don t
want to talk about it 
is what i think 
what is the point of
going round and round 
you re gonna change your mind five times
when we both know this
is the right thing to do 
great  fine 
fine  it s not like the kids
see you around here anyway  so fine 
oh 
if you had a decent job 
i wouldn t have to do this 
mama 
who s awake down there 
what are you doing 
you have tiger scratches 
i also have a secret i want to tell you 
i love somebody in this room 
is it me 
you guessed it 
actually  i love two people in this room 
i love you  and i love max 
you also love yourself 
so that s three people 
right  but i love you and max
and papa even more than i love myself 
me  too  mama 
i can t stop loving you 
ohh 
how d i get so lucky 
tell me a story  mama 
okay  what about 
about cinderella  ariel 
spider man  and max 
and max  okay 
well  one day  cinderella  ariel  and max
were walking through the park 
and all of a sudden 
spider man went swinging by 
and spider man stopped
as soon as he saw max 
because he knew he needed her
for a very important mission 
i wouldn t have done that 
so you ve learned how to move the pieces 
i ve been taking lessons 
i m ready to play you 
who ve you been studying with 
he can t be better than my teacher 
vadim alexeyevich 
i m sure you know who that is 
he teaches me in russian 
you speak russian 
not really 
but he s such a genius 
it doesn t even matter 
anyway  why should i play you 
what s in it for me 
at this school  i m here  and you re here 
you re scared 
please 
okay 
if you win  i ll leave the school 
and if you win 
which could only happen
if i go into a coma 
then you have to leave the school 
not a chance 
okay 
then you have to stop bothering me 
that s pretty broad 
i ll stop insulting you in public 
that s acceptable 
okay 
today i m gonna go first 
listen  norman  i need
to tell you something 
tell me later 
move first 
i m going to play a real chess match 
the hell you are 
no  i am 
i m going to play against someone else 
what 
i m going to play a real chess match
against someone else 
i told you you weren t ready 
well  i thought i was 
then i guess we re done 
hey  maxie 
how was school today 
it was fine 
yeah  what d you do 
the usual 
nothing 
i see 
hey  maxie  do you like your new school 
you re not supposed to like school  papa 
oh  really 
at best  you re supposed to tolerate it 
okay  then 
do you tolerate your new school 
i tolerate it 
that s good 
i guess 
you know  parents  they always think
they know better than their kids 
duh 
and they do for a while 
but pretty soon you re
gonna be coming home
with math homework that
i don t understand 
that you re gonna know the
right answer way before i do 
you know what i mean 
i m only doing multiplication 
it s a metaphor 
oh 
i don t like metaphors 
all right  listen 
i ll be back in a few
minutes  okay  honey 
you call me if you need me 
sleep 
sleep  matia mou 
i might have made a mistake  yaya 
everybody makes mistakes 
your mother married your father 
why do you keep doing that 
habit 
don t worry about it 
make the best choice you can 
that s what your mother did
when she went to boston 
she made her best 
you make a choice  then go on 
life s too short 
compared to what 
what do you mean 
i mean  compare our lives
to the life of a spider 
they must think we live forever 
huh  you re right  matia mou 
life is also very  very long 
so what should i do 
you know what i m gonna say 
yes 
now go to sleep  matia mou 
karaniecta  matia mou 
look  it s my life  not yours 
i m entitled to play
against somebody else 
seriously  the silent treatment 
now who s the six year old 
i need to start making my own decisions 
but i m sorry that i didn t
tell you in advance  norman 
that was a mistake 
this is not what i expected 
this is your great teacher 
she called you norman 
what s your last name 
it doesn t speak 
why am i not surprised 
his name is norman wallach 
 speaking in foreign language 
that s my tibetan nanny  tashi 
my parents insist i only
speak mandarin with her 
i have tae kwon do class now 
let s play tomorrow here 
i want norman to see me beat you 
i ll bring the clocks 
she s the one you re gonna play against 
you gotta beat her 
tell me about it 
she said she s bringing clocks 
what does that mean 
chess clocks 
you only get a certain
amount of time to make all your moves 
it makes the game move faster 
i always liked that you can control
how fast the game changed 
hey  look  chess is change 
it d be pretty boring if
the pieces never moved 
but sometimes you want
things to stay the same 
you know that great
pizza place on west 11th 
sure 
i been there a hundred times 
seems like that place
has been around forever 
yeah  it has been 
but sooner or later  it ll close 
every place has to  eventually 
you just have to enjoy it while it s here 
enough with the metaphors 
then listen 
you can t just use the
same pieces you always use 
find new ones 
look for one that could be
more valuable than you think it is 
you can t lose 
you think you re gonna lose 
give me a signal  and
i ll knock the board over 
i m serious 
back in a sec 
here s the plan 
i m going to pretend to
be blind  and you ask 
no 
come on  i ll go 50 50 with you 
you re underutilized 
huh 
come with me 
all right  6 to 1 1 2 
that can t be right 
all right  164 to 41 
what 
ooh 
what s the count 
it s  uh  10 016 to 2 504 
or it s eight to two 
it s about as simple as i m gonna make it 
this is b ball  after all 
i don t get it 
the city is going to help me beat her 
go ahead  you re first 
it s eight to two 
this is b ball  after all 
so  b4 
you know  that pawn is you 
what 
 speaking in foreign language 
he s not allowed to coach you 
it doesn t matter 
i have no idea what he s saying 
remember  your board  your city 
that s the stupidest
thing i ve ever heard 
you re a sucky teacher 
go back to the suburbs where you belong 
i m from the upper west side  if you 
like i said  go back to the suburbs 
i m sure they never heard of
the mexican defense there 
there s no such thing
as the mexican defense 
says you 
 singing in foreign language 
c  c  c  c 
c4 
pawn takes pawn 
 speaking in foreign language 
i wish i understood him 
checkmate in three moves 
unless you find the one move
that wins the game for you 
hey  he said it 
i m just translating 
you don t speak russian 
oh 
 speaking in foreign language 
i don t see it 
look harder 
i don t see it 
look harder 
you have 20 seconds to make your move 
or you lose 
i do not get that 
10 seconds 
take responsibility 
you happen to life 
of course 
i m going to turn into a queen 
my pawn will become a queen in two moves 
then checkmate 
she can t stop me 
you re gonna win 
put it down 
what s wrong  is there
a problem with the move 
no 
congratulations 
enjoy school without me 
very good player 
i don t understand 
she s coming back to ps 41 
just when i was about to win 
i realized that i didn t want to 
you didn t want to win 
no  i didn t want to go back
to the blackstone academy 
nothing against it  it s just
i ve got a fantastic school
that s a five minute walk from my house 
i love it there 
it s my neighborhood school 
that s what a real city
kid would do  isn t it 
plus they ve got the second best
chess team in the city 
maybe i can put them over the top 
yeah 
yes  i do 
you do not 
that means your wish
will  in fact  come true
18 years from now 
  mama 
you re back 
ohh  hi  honey 
oh  i couldn t be away from my girls 
yaya 
what  you re surprised 
i wasn t sure i d see you again 
this is the last time 
you don t need me no more 
i ll always need you 
oh  no  that didn t come out right 
but you know what i mean 
thank you  yaya 
everything worked out okay with your help 
you did it all yourself 
but i want to answer
that question of yours 
about why things have to change 
hmm 
i think i know the answer 
tell me  matia mou 
because sometimes a great old pizza place
has to close so that a new one can open 
i hate metaphors 
say hello to norman for me 
what do they want 
they re trying to convince me to come back
to the blackstone academy
after i graduate from ps 41 
you ll have your choice of schools 
they also want you to teach them 
they re not city kids 
maybe we can teach them how to be 
i guess i could teach you all together 
three six year olds
almost makes a grown up 
we re not six 
he knows 
we ll start tomorrow 
three kids at once 
i must be an idiot 
it s lucky for you i m such a softie 
get out of here 
hey  shmuel 
don t worry about the next game 
enjoy this one 
know what i mean 
yeah 
i ll try 
i m going to enjoy beating
you  that s for sure 
you couldn t beat me
if i gave you a bag of
oranges  three hammers 
a baseball bat  and the brooklyn dodgers 
anybody want to play some chess 
 upbeat music
