hi annie take a seat
im just finishing this up
thanks
oh take your time
whats that
uh i was just taking
a couple of deep breaths
someone recommended
i try it when im nervous
you know what else works
xanax oh its so good
all benzos really
but that one works extremely well
very fastacting
huh i never take xanax
well you should really try it
if you mix it with wine or beer it sort of
supercharges it
i should try that
why are you nervous
i know you know its the
end of the semester
and i also know
theres budgetary issues
and that you have to
let a few professors go
and so when i got the note in my box
i think i just assumed the worst
would you be afraid to get fired
if your job was to clean the floor
at one of those coinoperated jackoff booths
you know where youre the one
holding the mop
um fired from a jackoff booth
where the truckers go and masturbate
yeah i know what youre talking about
well would you
um
no i would not
and yet youre here at milton valley
the jackoff booth of academia
im not sure what your point is
youre too smart and passionate
to work here so why do you
you know i created
my own major at stanford
i have a doctorate in nonviolent
conflict resolution
which no university offers as a major
they just dont
so i teach intro to soc classes
and im im also
in a relationship here
im going to stop you
uc is starting a conflict
resolution program
i spoke to the head of
the sociology department
and shes extremely interested
in hiring you to run that program
no way
now shes meeting the other
applicant on wednesday
and shell need to
make a decision that day
their semester starts in a week
youre meeting her on wednesday
oh my god
thank you so much im so flattered
that you would even consider me
i just have to check with my boyfriend
charlie because he has
he cant exactly leave uh milton
annie
please i went to state school
i went to football games and blacked
out and got date raped
i had abortions i worried too much
about what my boyfriends thought
i got what i deserved
but thats not you
you deserve so much more than this
i hope your neighbor doesnt report
why youre a marshal youre allowed
to fire your weapon arent you
yeah but ive had a couple incidences
and this would be bad
although i dont know what more
they could do to me
this seems like the bottom of the barrel
as far as being a marshal
why did you get stuck
with witness protection
because i accidentally
discharged my weapon
once at a gas station and another
time at a baseball game
at a baseball game yes
no nobody are you kidding me no
it wasnt even my fault
im not kidding you
you shoot your weapon
off at a baseball game
its not crazy that i would assume
maybe someone got shot
listen i asked for a revolver
a revolver has a hammer that you pull back
and a safety but no what do
they give me right
jesus christ man
be careful with that
yeah look at that
okay now you heard stuff
going on i mean
i dont know thats not even safe
randy randy randy randy
please please
please please okay
ill just
from now on dont touch
my weapon anymore okay
listen i wasnt i know were
friends and everything
and its kind of a gray area now
that we are friends
but do not touch my weapon
again its unsafe
okay im sorry
i trained for two years
to be able to do this
okay so please do me a solid
im not going to touch it
i wont bring it up again
i promise im not going to touch it
all right thank you
okay

and its not your fault i know
oh no did it not go good

then why are you upset
you just look so stupid sitting there
so impossibly cute
and i dont even know
why you like me so much
oh mama i think youre stupid
i should have oiled that
so she didnt fire you
debby found me a job where i could
head my own department
in my field
and it would be the first one
like it in the country
and it would be perfect
then why are you upset
because its in la
and i would have to
leave and move to la
its in la
thats the only place
this job exists in la
no other place
no charlie
theres no other place
it only exists in la
and debby told me that
if i didnt take the interview
she would fire me
and i wouldnt even
have my job here anymore

that makes me happy
the one thing that makes this
shithole town bearable is leaving

like its gonna break
it sounds like
it has 700 horsepower
believe me
all dudes love
how this car sounds
whoa whoa whoa
im in a 700
horsepower dude lure
thats right
apologies
i had no idea
you definitely told me
this car was broken
it was when i was
talking about turning the
shed into a craft room
yeah
yeah
so why did you say that
why did i say that
holy shnikes
look at this
theres a parrot
driving this car
uhhuh
a driving parrot
oh man
im gonna be rich
i found the only
driving parrot
i was hiding it
in the shed
cause youre
not supposed to
bring anything with you
i mean
especially not a car
but i spent a year and
a half building this
thing with my dad
and i didnt want to
just not have it anymore
you wanted to
bring it because you
built it with your dad
yeah
we werent the
hottest communicators
but we kind of
worked well together
so he was into
offroad racing and
we did that together
and then he was
into building old cars
and we did that
i think its sweet
i want a burger
mmm i want a burger too
lets get some beef
lets get some
beef up in us
what are you doing
im on my pouncer app
yeah
i understand its an app
im saying when you
hit the pouncer app
what happens
i hit pouncer
and it sends out my
exact location on this map
and then i can see
who else has pouncer
on the same exact map
and i can chat with
them in real time
and be like
hey where are you
whats going on
oh
youre the only one on here
yeah
well were in the
middle of nowhere
theres no gays
have you used it
in another city
oh my god
airports vegas
you know
austin lights up like
a fucking christmas tree
ten feet away
zero feet away
guys wanting to hook up
for coffee or like
no to fuck
or hand jobs or blowjobs
or kissing whatever
so wait then like
you just hit a button
and within five minutes
you and a stranger
having sex
or having hand jobs
i mean
thats not the
intention of the app
i think the intention
of the app is to see whos
straight and whos gay
like for you
youre straight
so its safe to assume
that you can
hit on anyone
or flirt with them
and then i do that
what happens
victim of a hate crime
yeah not cool
not cool at all

change your mind
it doesnt work

what are you
fucking kidding
you know you

you have to have a marshal
with you at all times
in case something happens
and if something happens
to you i am fucking fired
hey look im sorry
im not trying to
get you fired okay
im leaving
witness protection

youve got to
fill out forms and shit
okay
where are you right now
just stay right
where youre at
and im coming to you
no no listen randy
ive got to get her

i would have told

we should get on the road
okay
hey chief
is this your car
yeah man
you shouldnt touch
oh its so nice
thanks
i bet this
things got nitrous
this got nitrous
no nitrous is for fags
its got cubic inches
cubic inches
did you just say fags
yeah
but not in like
a homophobic way
i used it
in place of lame
why wouldnt
you just say lame
well same reason
i say fuck
instead of frick
it packs more punch
its basically the swear
word version of lame
no its not
its a hate word used
to perpetuate homophobia
its used to
marginalize gay people
youre acting like
you dont know me
i voted to
legalize civil unions
when i had friends
i had a lot of gay friends
then you shouldnt say fag
i dont
i dont use it in reference
to actual people
i mean especially
homosexual people
so then
that makes it okay
yeah i think so
i mean morally
i feel fine about it
so as long as its not
in reference to a person
its all right
like if i wanted
to start calling
my purse the n word
honey have you
seen my n word
i cant find my n word
anywhere and its the
expensive one
okay i will
work on it
thank you
are you fucking
kidding me

him out of the car and
beat the shit out of him

you solve things

how you handle this
especially with
a turd like gil
im sorry which one of us

im not gonna teach

a certain type of person
like people who are
i dont know
lets just
call them rapists
out of convenience
if you started
to notice that your
peers were rapists
what do you think that
says about the old you
who built this car
look this car
is designed specific
what appeals to me
is probably not what
appeals to other dudes okay
i wanted something
that was as fast as hell
seated six people
and had a trunk
the size of an suvs
but why
i feel like youre
insinuating that i have small
dick complex or something
and i dont we both
know thats not the case
i have a lot of issues
but not that one
im just teasing you
i dont think couples can
really tease each other
i think everyone
pretends they can
but really theres
always some kind of
truth or judgment
in there somewhere
baloney
couples can tease
oh yeah
its playful
well of course
i can say to you
youre too fat
or youre too tall
and clearly im joking
but anything else
i say im probably
hinting at something
that bothers me
about you
but im framing it
as a joke so that
when a fight ensues
i dont have to take
responsibility for it
do you want to
just go to this place
sure
i feel like you just
got really upset though
and i honestly was
just teasing you
okay ill be back
in a second
its okay if youre
feeling sensitive
and ill drop it
the only reason
i want to talk about it
is so we can
figure out why
i think its just going
home after four years
its just bringing
up some weird shit
what kind of weird shit
i dont know
just weird shit really
oh my god
oh hey
sorry
sorry about that
sorry very sorry
our bad sorry
oh my god
get away from the door
that was a real
life lemon party
that was grannies and
grampies fooling around

my facebook page
i dont know why
you aint single and
youve got three friends
what the fuck you be
checking on facebook

babe you gonna
take care of the dogs
mmmhmm
did you put the alarm on
yes
hey honey
what was gil screaming
when you were
walking towards the car
he sounded like he
was repeating something
i dont know what the fuck
he was saying hes nuts
well obviously you heard
what he was saying
he kept repeating it
over and over again
he was just talking shit
but what was it
huh
charlie
what was he saying
he was saying yul perrkins
he was saying yul perrkins
over and over again
so that you would hear
and then we would
be in this fight
so he won
were not fighting
what are you
whos yul perrkins
thats my name
thats my real name
yul perrkins
perrkins yul perrkins
is my real name
why on earth would
we fight about that
i dont know
i just feel like this
is gonna be a fight
like why wouldnt i have
told you my name before
or that comment you
made about my car
or the old me
i just you know
i want everything to be
exactly how its been
since weve met
i dont want to have
to go all the way back
into my background
just because
were going to la
can you calm down
come here
come here for a second
please come sit
on the bed with me
i think yul perrkins
is a very cute name
i think it sounds like a sesame streecharacter
yeah
so did all the kids
on the playground
it was not very cute
my dad loves yul brynner
he thinks hes a badass
but no one
in my generations
ever heard of him
can i ask you
one more question
and you promise
youll tell the truth
yeah
did they assign you
the name charlie bronson
or did you get to pick it
i picked it
was it cause you
thought it sounded tough
and you were tired of
having a sissy name
yeah
that is the most adorable
thing ive ever heard
come here
and you loved
charles bronson movies
i actually named myself
after that famous
english prisoner
who named himself after
the actor charles bronson
and i found him
intriguing i guess
thats weird
to find someone
like that intriguing
its weird
well look
i dont know
it sounds stupid now that
im saying it out loud
but at the time it seemed
i didnt know you
then annie
so i obviously
picked the wrong name
and im sorry that i
its fine hey hey
you can call me
whatever you want
youre not on trial here
okay this is all
just new to me
come back here come back
you want to drop it
yeah i would appreciate that
okay
are you kidding me
might as well tap me on
the shoulder and say
fuck you
sir are you okay
have you been
in an accident
what
no im a us marshal
okay sir your vehicle
appears to be totaled
and i clocked you at 127
miles per hour back there
im a marshal
and ive got someone
in witness protection
who needs my protection
i totally understand sir
is there any way you
could stay below 100
im very worried
about this car getting
up into triple digits
i suppose i could try
to keep it in the high 90s
thank you
cause just like
its your job
to be protecting
whoever you may
be protecting
um
what hold on a second
ill be right back sir
i need to talk to you

but your phone did vibrate
and so i checked it out and
thats your pouncer app right

okay so that dot popped up like
two seconds ago

another gay guy within

straight person you meet

how did you steal it
if you lose
your keyless entry
and go to the dealership
they use the
vin number to get a new
code in their program
and i got a new code
and i programmed this one
but how
how did you get the code
i have passwords for
the different dealerships
why do you have
those passwords
charlie
look if we have
this conversation
im afraid youre
not gonna want to
be with me anymore
okay well if we dont
have this conversation
i cant be with you
i cant be
with someone
that i dont trust
so youre just going
to have to risk it
asshole
you know
i witnessed a bank robbery
that went really wrong
yeah
what i left out is that
i was kind of involved
not in the violence part
but in the getaway
driving part
im sorry i didnt
say that to you
but when i got into
witness protection
i looked at it
as a new beginning
and i knew i wasnt going
to be that guy anymore
youre a bank robber
charlie
no i didnt actually
rob any of the banks
alex and allen
did the robbing
and i did the
driving them to and
from the bank robbing
banks plural
how many times did
you do that charlie
i dont know a few
you dont know
maybe 12 or 13
maybe maybe a dozen
maybe a bakers dozen
youre not sure
no it was 13
yes it was absolutely 13
this is why i didnt
tell you about this
because i knew you were
going to react this way
who wouldnt react this way
charlie a sociopath
look i have
a terrible past
im sorry about that
but it has
nothing to do with us
howd you do it
howd you get off charlie
you testified against
your friends to save
your own ass
they were gonna
charge neve with
accessory to murder
because she cased the job
so either i turned
on alex and allen
who did the shooting
or neve went to prison
for the rest of her life
who is neve
the black girl
in the station wagon
why arent they
in prison charlie
they implied i wasnt
a credible witness
because i was
you know
engaged to neve
you were engaged to a woman
who plans bank robberies
who are you
listen sweetie please
dont
pull the car over
i think im going
to throw up
i cant pull over right now
or alex is gonna
shoot both of us
then fucking
lose them charlie
so you can let me out
hey buddy
its me from last night
yeah the minivan
i could really use your help
im at some
abandoned airfield
i cannot believe this is
a fucking station wagon
this shit is so fast
we might not make this
watch out for gil
fucking shit
ah
fuck
fuck
ah damn it
pick up already
debby
its not a good time
oh am i fucking up
your massage
cause youre
fucking up mine
i got a call from uc
sandys got some
emergency tomorrow
so you have to be
there by 400 pm today
that might be impossible
are you kidding me
i could leave milton now
and be there by 400
deb i dont think
you understand
annie i am in the
middle of something
just get there
dont be a pussy
please pull over and
find a place to let me out
annie i want to talk
about this okay
just let me drive you
to la and we can talk it
out on the way
you are engaged
youre a criminal
if you dont pull over
im jumping out
and im not kidding
okay okay okay okay
hold on a second okay
annie hey
where are you going
youre going
to walk aimlessly
through an orange grove
i did not lie to you
omitting is lying charlie
what if i had sex
with a coworker and
i didnt tell you that
you wouldnt
think that was a lie
no that would be a lie
because were in
a relationship
and we owe each other
those kind of details
look whatever youre
mad about happened
before we ever met okay
look i have not
violated your trust
once since we met
except for completely
lying about who you are
look you may have had
threeways with dudes
or smoked cocaine
but if you had
just because you didnt
disclose that to me
doesnt mean
youre a liar
i dont care what
you did before we met
all i care about
is who you are now
really
so if i was a pedophile
if i had raped children
you wouldnt care about that
if i had been a member of
the ku klux klan no biggie
you wouldnt feel like
a complete idiot for having
fallen in love with me
buddy i
im sorry im sorry
i was ashamed
and i was embarrassed
and i thought we would
just live in milton for
the rest of our lives
and be happy
and have babies
and i would be charlie
and that would be that
what if i did tell you
be honest
would you have
fallen in love with me
i dont know
and im never gonna know
because you took that
decision away from me
but yes charlie
i find it very difficult
to believe
that someone who
justified robbing 13 banks
would ever not be
that type of person
its not exactly
the high profile
background you look for
when youre choosing
someone to have a baby with
you know
if i was an exdrug addict
or an exalcoholic
i guarantee
you would be able
to look past that
thats not the point
the bottom line is
in any relationship
you can either wallow
in the persons past
or you can look
at the person thats
right in front of you
and choose
to move forward
but you cant do both
i agree
then move forward with me
but the person in
front of me lied to me
whether you want to call
it that or not charlie
i need to get to la
and im gonna do
that without you
how
hey
hey
are you okay
yeah im fine
can you um
can you drive me
the rest of the way
to la please
of course
or would you rather
go back to our house
and digest all this
no gil
i just want
to get to la
i can do that
why dont you hop in
and ill gather
all your belongings
okay
hey asshole
do not even think about
tailing us im serious
or what youre gonna
stab me with that knife
i could if you charged me
yeah okay
im terrified
yeah well
youre the aggressor
listen i still think
youre a fucking turd
but im sorry
that i clocked you
and i appreciate you
taking annie to la
youre welcome
oh and we know
who got the best
of who in that scuffle
so if you forgot

this shitty mess
where i got to
pick between my fiancée

you were inside
the bank and you saw
the security guard
pointing a fucking
gun at allen

oldies station

an hour fucking retard

stay in the car
hold on a second dude
youre gonna fucking turn
this into kidnapping
hey no im being serious
alex please listen to me
youre gonna risk going to
prison when im cooperating
i dont get it
cause you
owe me motherfucker
i want you to feel the
fucking uncomfortable
situation i was in
you got off
what are you talking about
oh my god eight months
are you fucking crazy
ive been in siberia
for four years
the fucking
arrogance of you man
i dont understand what
you fucking didnt like
the gym equipment
there wasnt enough
time for you to read
i got buttfucked
i got
fucked in the butt
because of you
yeah
thats horrible
i did not realize
that happened in jail
i thought that
was a prison thing
yeah well
i guess its not
exclusive to prisons
well i mean youve never
been like a homophobe
it seems like something
you probably worked through
youre a strong dude
i dont think homophobia
has anything to do with it
the guy was disgusting
if i was gay
i would still want
to come after you
im really sorry
im really really sorry
was it a black guy
no it wasnt a black guy
thats a pretty fucking
racist thing to say
you think thats racist
yeah
i think thats
the opposite of racist
i dont think it would
make a black guy gay
to fuck a white dude
because were such
pussies compared to them
what the fuck
are you even talking
about right now
im saying if i was
a black dude i wouldnt
feel the least bit gay
i would think a white guy is
just like masculine chicks
like ellen
shes masculine
but i would
totally fuck her
if i were single
i wasnt fucked
by a black guy
okay
can we just go
okay
was it a mexican guy
no
oh man
was it one of
those white guys
those fucking nazis
no it was not
a fucking white guy either
charlie
it doesnt matter who
violated him okay
it could have been
any number of people
it doesnt matter
their race okay
it could have
been latino it could
have been tongan
it could have
been a persian
it was filipino
i was buttfucked by
a filipino dude okay
does that fucking
solve your dilemma
of what part of the world
my ass traveled to
well
i mean i dont think
thats not so bad
i mean just like
all black dudes
think of us as women
i think of all asians
as women you know
even the men
i feel like you
basically hooked up
with an asian lady
charlie just
no i didnt hook up with
anybody bro i was raped
okay listen i dont
fucking hooked up
i feel partly responsible for this
