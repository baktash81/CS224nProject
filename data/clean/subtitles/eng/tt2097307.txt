okay  next subject 
hi  annie  take a seat 
i m just finishing this up 
thanks 
oh  take your time 
what s that 
uh  i was just taking
a couple of deep breaths 
someone recommended
i try it when i m nervous 
you know what else works 
xanax  oh  it s so good 
all benzos  really 
but that one works extremely well 
very fast acting 
huh  i never take xanax 
well  you should really try it 
if you mix it with wine or beer it sort of
supercharges it 
i should try that 
why are you nervous 
i know  you know  it s the
end of the semester
and i also know
there s budgetary issues 
and that you have to
let a few professors go 
and so when i got the note in my box 
i think i just assumed the worst 
would you be afraid to get fired
if your job was to clean the floor
at one of those coin operated jack off booths 
you know  where you re the one
holding the mop 
um  fired from a jack off booth 
where the truckers go and masturbate 
yeah  i know what you re talking about 
well  would you 
um   
no  i would not 
and yet  you re here at milton valley 
the jack off booth of academia 
i m not sure what your point is 
you re too smart and passionate
to work here  so why do you 
you know  i created
my own major at stanford 
i have a doctorate in non violent
conflict resolution 
which no university offers as a major 
they just don t 
so i teach intro to soc classes 
and i m    i m also
in a relationship here 
i m going to stop you 
uc is starting a conflict
resolution program 
i spoke to the head of
the sociology department 
and she s extremely interested
in hiring you to run that program 
no way 
now  she s meeting the other
applicant on wednesday
and she ll need to
make a decision that day 
their semester starts in a week 
you re meeting her on wednesday 
oh  my god 
thank you so much  i m so flattered
that you would even consider me 
i just have to check with my boyfriend
charlie because he has   
he can t exactly leave  uh  milton 
annie 
please  i went to state school 
i went to football games and blacked
out and got date raped 
i had abortions  i worried too much
about what my boyfriends thought 
i got what i deserved 
but that s not you 
you deserve so much more than this 
i hope your neighbor doesn t report
why  you re a marshal  you re allowed
to fire your weapon  aren t you 
yeah  but i ve had a couple incidences 
and this would be bad 
although  i don t know what more
they could do to me 
this seems like the bottom of the barrel
as far as being a marshal 
why did you get stuck
with witness protection 
because i accidentally
discharged my weapon 
once at a gas station and another
time at a baseball game 
at a baseball game  yes 
no  nobody  are you kidding me  no 
it wasn t even my fault 
i m not kidding you 
you shoot your weapon
off at a baseball game
it s not crazy that i would assume
maybe someone got shot 
listen  i asked for a revolver 
a revolver has a hammer that you pull back 
and a safety  but no  what do
they give me  right 
jesus christ  man 
be careful with that 
yeah  look at that 
okay  now  you heard stuff
going on  i mean   
i don t know  that s not even safe 
randy  randy  randy  randy 
please  please 
please  please  okay 
i ll just   
from now on  don t touch
my weapon anymore  okay 
listen  i wasn t    i know we re
friends and everything 
and it s kind of a gray area now
that we are friends 
but do not touch my weapon
again  it s unsafe 
okay  i m sorry 
i trained for two years
to be able to do this 
okay  so please  do me a solid 
i m not going to touch it 
i won t bring it up again 
i promise  i m not going to touch it 
all right  thank you 
okay 
okay 
and it s not your fault  i know 
oh  no  did it not go good 
no  it went really well 
then why are you upset 
you just look so stupid sitting there 
so impossibly cute 
and i don t even know
why you like me so much 
oh  mama  i think you re stupid 
i should have oiled that 
so she didn t fire you 
debby found me a job where i could
head my own department 
in my field 
and it would be the first one

leave and move to l a 
it s in l a  
that s the only place
this job exists  in l a

she would fire me 
and i wouldn t even
have my job here anymore 
will you say something  please 
what do you want me to say 
there s nothing to say 
well  what are you thinking

that makes me happy 
the one thing that makes this
shit hole town bearable is leaving 
i didn t say i was leaving 
you re leaving 
even if you wanted to stay 
i wouldn t let you 
i wouldn t forgive myself
and you wouldn t either 
that s not true

secondly  you don t
have the authority
to not let me

given that name when
he entered protection
which he entered because
he witnessed a crime  okay

what s with this car 
i mean   
it s kind of obnoxious 
oh  you think this
car is obnoxious 
 cause i think it s tits 
and i think
most people think
this car is tits 
it sounds like
it s gonna break 
no  it does not sound
like it s gonna break 
it sounds like
it has 700 horsepower 
believe me 
all dudes love
how this car sounds 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
i m in a 700
horsepower dude lure 
that s right 
apologies 
i had no idea 
you definitely told me
this car was broken 
it was when i was
talking about turning the
shed into a craft room 
yeah 
yeah 
so  why did you say that 
why did i say that 
holy shnikes 
look at this 
there s a parrot
driving this car 
uh huh 
a driving parrot 
oh  man 
i m gonna be rich 
i found the only
driving parrot 
i was hiding it
in the shed
 cause you re
not supposed to
bring anything with you 
i mean 
especially not a car 
but i spent a year and
a half building this
thing with my dad
and i didn t want to
just not have it anymore 
you wanted to
bring it because you
built it with your dad 
yeah 
we weren t the
hottest communicators 
but we kind of
worked well together 
so he was into
off road racing and
we did that together 
and then he was
into building old cars
and we did that 
i think it s sweet 
i want a burger 
mmm  i want a burger too 
let s get some beef 
let s get some
beef up in us 
what are you doing 
i m on my pouncer app 
yeah 
i understand it s an app 
i m saying when you
hit the pouncer app
what happens 
i hit pouncer 
and it sends out my
exact location on this map 
and then i can see
who else has pouncer
on the same exact map 
and i can chat with
them in real time 
and be like 
 hey  where are you 
what s going on  
oh 
you re the only one on here 
yeah 
well  we re in the
middle of nowhere 
there s no gays 
have you used it
in another city 
oh  my god 
airports  vegas 
you know 
austin lights up like
a fucking christmas tree 
ten feet away 
zero feet away 
guys wanting to hook up 
for coffee  or like   
no  to fuck 
or hand jobs or blowjobs
or kissing  whatever 
so wait  then like 
you just hit a button
and within five minutes
you and a stranger 
having sex 
or having hand jobs 
i mean 
that s not the
intention of the app 
i think the intention
of the app is to see who s
straight and who s gay 
like for you 
you re straight
so it s safe to assume
that you can
hit on anyone
or flirt with them 
and then i do that 
what happens 
victim of a hate crime 
yeah  not cool 
not cool at all 
oh  gil 
what 
hey  did you
change your mind 
it doesn t work
like that  gil 
i can t have him
tailed or brought in 
he hasn t done anything 
i m telling you  the guy
is a fucking ted bundy

to murder her and do
kinky shit to her body 
and that s
gonna be on you 
you re supposed to
be a fucking cop 
i am a fucking cop  gil 
i don t need
you telling me
how to be a cop

in late august   you fuck 
 they have been awaiting

 while the state

bargain with perrkins  
alexander dmitri 
for the next 24 hours
i know where yul perrkins is 
they re saying
the iraqi dinar
is gonna go to the value
of the kuwait dollar 
what are you talking
about  iraqi dinar 
it s trading at 1000 dinar per u s  dollar 
oh  shit  it s randy 
hold on one second 
hey  where are y 
i picked somethig up for you 
a new bowling ball 
well  i was just thinking 
you re a really good bowler 
like naturally 
you re too good to
be using one of those
pitted out house balls 
that was really nice of you 
thanks  randy 
so when are you
going to be back 
um  well   
here s the thing 
annie got a really great
job opportunity in l a 
so i m gonna go
ahead and go with her 
what  are you
fucking kidding  
you know you
can t leave milton 
you cannot leave milto 
well  i know
it s not advised 
but technically
i think i can leave 
listen  if you do leave
you have to have a marshal
with you at all times
in case something happens 
and if something happens
to you  i am fucking fired 
hey  look  i m sorry 
i m not trying to
get you fired  okay 
i m leaving
witness protection 
so i m no longer
your responsibility 
i mean  i think
i can leave  no 
you can leave 
but there s a whole process 
you ve got to
fill out forms and shit 
okay 
where are you right now 
just stay right
where you re at
and i m coming to you 
no  no  listen  randy 
i ve got to get her
to this interview 
i would have told
you i was leaving
but this whole thing
happened really fast 
and i m sorry 
i m on my way 
what s your 20 
i m gonna call you
when we get to l a  okay 
nothing s gonna happen to me 
you just stay there 
what the fuck 
randy  i got to go  okay 
stay there  i m comi 
fuck  all right   
okay  you know what 
randy s hell bent
on protecting me 
and i think that could
be very dangerous for us 
we should get on the road 
okay 
hey  chief 
is this your car 
yeah  man 
you shouldn t touch 
oh  it s so nice 
thanks 
i bet this
thing s got nitrous 
this got nitrous 
no  nitrous is for fags 
it s got cubic inches 
cubic inches 
did you just say  fags  
yeah 
but not in  like 
a homophobic way 
i used it
in place of  lame  
why wouldn t
you just say  lame  
well  same reason
i say  fuck 
instead of  frick  
it packs more punch 
it s basically the swear
word version of lame 
no  it s not 
it s a hate word used
to perpetuate homophobia 
it s used to
marginalize gay people 
you re acting like
you don t know me 
i voted to
legalize civil unions 
when i had friends 
i had a lot of gay friends 
then you shouldn t say  fag  
i don t 
i don t use it in reference
to actual people 
i mean especially
homosexual people 
so then 
that makes it okay 
yeah  i think so 
i mean morally 
i feel fine about it 
so as long as it s not
in reference to a person 
it s all right 
like if i wanted
to start calling
my purse the n word 
 honey  have you
seen my n word 
 i can t find my n word
anywhere  and it s the
expensive one  
okay  i will
work on it 
thank you

kidding me

i m gonna pull
him out of the car and
beat the shit out of him 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
you re not doing that 
that s not how
you solve things 
that s exactly
how you handle this 
especially with
a turd like gil 
i m sorry  which one of us
has a doctorate in
conflict resolution 
 cause i think it s me 
listen  i respect
your degree  i do 
but it s not how
we re getting out
of this situation  okay 
we don t have time
to bring in a mediator 
charlie  i am not
going to live with
a man who says  fag 
and beats up guys
on the side of the road 
i m not gonna teach
non violence
at a university
and then marry
dog the bounty hunter 
i won t do it 
what are you doing  gil 
protecting someone i love

yul perrkins

i love annie 
enough to move back
to l a  for her where
i might get killed

because she asked me not to 
but if you do
something that results
in her leaving me 
i m going to
beat you to death 
i m literally gonna beat
you to fucking death  gil 
do you understand that 
that name stays
between you and i 
you know we have
a mutual friend 
i mean  technically

less significant than
a real friendship
but still kind of cool 
alex dmitri 
you know him 
alex dmitri 
i got you 
thank you 
thank you so much 
what did he say 
is he going home 
nope  no  he s going to follow us all the way to l a

then you re gonna have
to let me run from him 
okay 
i m proud of you 
thank you 
i m sure i ll get there 
yul 
yul perrkins 
what is he saying 
oh  who gives a shit 
this is probably gonna
get pretty fucking radical 
but i don t want you
to get scared  okay 
i raced all growing up
and i even drove
professionally for a while 
okay 
i trust you 
annie  hey 
this is gil 
i m following you  okay 
if he goes all psycho
and shit on you

of hand signal  okay

it was about 14 grand 
damn  that s commitment 
mmm hmm  yeah 
that s what i always say 
and the south
will rise again 
god  you own that too 
you know what 
it s a rental  actually 
aren t they all 
oh 
hey  have you noticed
that there is a certain
type of person
that is attracted
to this vehicle 
yeah  like the guy
at the gas station 
yes  like the guy
at the gas station 
like  if you spent two years
building your dream car
that is was also
the dream car of
a certain type of person 
like people who are   
i don t know 
let s just
call them rapists 
out of convenience 
if you started
to notice that your
peers were rapists 
what do you think that
says about the old you
who built this car 
look  this car
is designed specific 
what appeals to me
is probably not what
appeals to other dudes  okay 
i wanted something
that was as fast as hell 
seated six people 
and had a trunk
the size of an suv s 
but why 
i feel like you re
insinuating that i have small
dick complex or something 
and i don t  we both
know that s not the case 
i have a lot of issues 
but not that one 
i m just teasing you 
i don t think couples can
really tease each other 
i think everyone
pretends they can 
but really  there s
always some kind of
truth or judgment
in there somewhere 
baloney 
couples can tease 
oh  yeah 
it s playful 
well  of course 
i can say to you
you re too fat 
or you re too tall
and clearly i m joking 
but anything else
i say i m probably
hinting at something
that bothers me
about you 
but i m framing it
as a joke  so that
when a fight ensues
i don t have to take
responsibility for it 
do you want to
just go to this place 
sure 
i feel like you just
got really upset  though 
and i honestly was
just teasing you 
okay  i ll be back
in a second 
it s okay if you re
feeling sensitive
and i ll drop it 
the only reason
i want to talk about it
is so we can
figure out why 
i think it s just going
home after four years 
it s just bringing
up some weird shit 
what kind of weird shit 
i don t know 
just weird shit  really 
oh  my god 
oh  hey 
sorry 
sorry about that 
sorry  very sorry 
our bad  sorry 
oh  my god 
get away from the door 
that was a real
life lemon party 
that was grannies and
grampies fooling around 
what you buying  baby 
i was just checking
my facebook page 
i don t know why 
you ain t single and
you ve got three friends 
what the fuck you be
checking on facebook

new photos of himself
naked in front of the mirror

all right  i ll see you soon 
babe  you gonna
take care of the dogs 
mmm hmm 
did you put the alarm on 
yes 
hey  honey 
what was gil screaming
when you were
walking towards the car 
he sounded like he
was repeating something 
i don t know what the fuck
he was saying  he s nuts 
well  obviously you heard
what he was saying 
he kept repeating it
over and over again 
he was just talking shit 
but what was it 
huh 
charlie 
what was he saying 
he was saying  yul perrkins  
he was saying  yul perrkins 
over and over again
so that you would hear
and then we would
be in this fight 
so he won 
we re not fighting 
what are you   
who s yul perrkins 
that s my name 
that s my real name 
yul perrkins 
perrkins  yul perrkins
is my real name 
why on earth would
we fight about that 
i don t know 
i just feel like this
is gonna be a fight 
like  why wouldn t i have
told you my name before 
or that comment you
made about my car 
or the old me 
i just  you know   
i want everything to be
exactly how it s been
since we ve met 
i don t want to have
to go all the way back
into my background
just because
we re going to l a 
can you calm down 
come here 
come here for a second 
please come sit
on the bed with me 
i think yul perrkins
is a very cute name 
i think it sounds like a sesame streecharacter 
yeah 
so did all the kids
on the playground 
it was not very cute 
my dad loves yul brynner 
he thinks he s a badass 
but no one
in my generation s
ever heard of him 
can i ask you
one more question 
and you promise
you ll tell the truth 
yeah 
did they assign you
the name charlie bronson
or did you get to pick it 
i picked it 
was it  cause you
thought it sounded tough
and you were tired of
having a sissy name 
yeah 
that is the most adorable
thing i ve ever heard 
come here 
and you loved
charles bronson movies 
i actually named myself
after that famous
english prisoner
who named himself after
the actor charles bronson 
and i found him
intriguing  i guess 
that s weird 
to find someone
like that intriguing 
it s weird 
well  look 
i don t know   
it sounds stupid now that
i m saying it out loud 
but at the time it seemed   
i didn t know you
then  annie 
so i obviously
picked the wrong name 
and i m sorry that i   
it s fine  hey  hey 
you can call me
whatever you want 
you re not on trial here 
okay  this is all
just new to me 
come back here  come back 
you want to drop it 
yeah  i would appreciate that 
okay 
127 
are you kidding me 
might as well tap me on
the shoulder and say 
 fuck you  
sir  are you okay 
have you been
in an accident 
what 
no  i m a u s  marshal 
okay  sir  your vehicle
appears to be totaled 
and i clocked you at 127
miles per hour back there 
i m a marshal 
and i ve got someone
in witness protection
who needs my protection 
i totally understand  sir 
is there any way you
could stay below 100 
i m very worried
about this car getting
up into triple digits 
i suppose i could try
to keep it in the high 90s 
thank you 
 cause just like
it s your job
to be protecting
whoever you may
be protecting   
um   
what  hold on a second 
i ll be right back  sir 
i need to talk to you 
what 
what 
okay  i wasn t snooping 
but your phone did vibrate
and so i checked it out and   
that s your pouncer app  right 
yeah 
okay  so that dot popped up like
two seconds ago 
so  there s got to be
another gay guy within 
what  100 feet of here 
yeah 
i mean  it must be him 
although i don t think
he s gay  he s like 50 
there s 50 year old
gay people  angella 
we don t grow out of being gay 
oh  no  i didn t   
that s not what i meant  i just   
i just think you
should ask him out 
what do you mean   
oh  because he s gay
and i m gay i should
just ask him out 
are you instantly
attracted to every
straight person you meet 
no 
come on 
i m actually
gonna let you go 
but i do need to
see your phone for
a second please  sir 
why 
a small request after
you were driving that fast 
can i see your
phone please  sir 
thank you very much 
yeah  there we go 
that s what i thought 
uh    hi

very flattered

and you re a five  so   
you have a safe night 
right 
okay  do you need to
call me back after you ve
collected yourself 
no  no  no  i m good 
so i stopped off at
san andreas and jackson 
they were nowhere

so my guess is mariposa 
we ll take a peek in planada
on our way up to mariposa 
oh  great  great

who s my girlfriend
and a victim in all this

did you just
steal this car

but only because
i absolutely had to 
how did you steal it 
if you lose
your keyless entry
and go to the dealership
they use the
vin number to get a new
code in their program 
and i got a new code
and i programmed this one 
but how 
how did you get the code 
i have passwords for
the different dealerships 
why do you have
those passwords 
charlie 
look  if we have
this conversation
i m afraid you re
not gonna want to
be with me anymore 
okay  well  if we don t
have this conversation 
i can t be with you 
i can t be
with someone
that i don t trust 
so you re just going
to have to risk it 
asshole 
you know
i witnessed a bank robbery
that went really wrong 
yeah 
what i left out is that
i was kind of involved 
not in the violence part 
but in the getaway
driving part 
i m sorry i didn t
say that to you 
but when i got into
witness protection
i looked at it
as a new beginning 
and i knew i wasn t going
to be that guy anymore   
you re a bank robber 
charlie 
no  i didn t actually
rob any of the banks 
alex and allen
did the robbing
and i did the
driving them to and
from the bank robbing 
banks  plural 
how many times did
you do that  charlie 
i don t know  a few 
you don t know 
maybe 12 or 13 
 maybe   maybe a dozen 
maybe a baker s dozen 
you re not sure 
no  it was 13 
yes  it was absolutely 13 
this is why i didn t
tell you about this 
because i knew you were
going to react this way 
who wouldn t react this way 
charlie  a sociopath 
look  i have
a terrible past 
i m sorry about that 
but it has
nothing to do with us 
how d you do it 
how d you get off  charlie 
you testified against
your friends to save
your own ass 
they were gonna
charge neve with
accessory to murder
because she cased the job 
so either i turned
on alex and allen 
who did the shooting 
or neve went to prison
for the rest of her life 
who is neve 
the black girl
in the station wagon 
why aren t they
in prison  charlie 
they implied i wasn t
a credible witness
because i was   
you know 
engaged to neve 
you were engaged to a woman
who plans bank robberies 
who are you 
listen  sweetie  please 
don t 
pull the car over 
i think i m going
to throw up 
i can t pull over right now 
or alex is gonna
shoot both of us 
then fucking
lose them  charlie 
so you can let me out 
hey  buddy 
it s me from last night 
yeah  the minivan 
i could really use your help
i m at some
abandoned airfield 
i cannot believe this is
a fucking station wagon 
this shit is so fast 
we might not make this 
watch out for gil 
fucking shit 
ah 
fuck 
fuck 
ah  damn it 
pick up already 
debby 
it s not a good time 
oh  am i fucking up
your massage 
 cause you re
fucking up mine 
i got a call from uc 
sandy s got some
emergency tomorrow 
so you have to be
there by 4 00 p m  today 
that might be impossible 
are you kidding me 
i could leave milton now
and be there by 4 00 
deb  i don t think
you understand 
annie  i am in the
middle of something 
just get there 
don t be a pussy 
please pull over and
find a place to let me out 
annie  i want to talk
about this  okay 
just let me drive you
to l a  and we can talk it
out on the way 
you are engaged 
you re a criminal 
if you don t pull over 
i m jumping out 
and i m not kidding 
okay  okay  okay  okay 
hold on a second  okay 
annie  hey 
where are you going 
you re going
to walk aimlessly
through an orange grove 
i did not lie to you 
omitting is lying  charlie 
what if i had sex
with a co worker and
i didn t tell you that 
you wouldn t
think that was a lie 
no  that would be a lie 
because we re in
a relationship
and we owe each other
those kind of details 
look  whatever you re
mad about happened
before we ever met  okay 
look  i have not
violated your trust
once since we met 
except for completely
lying about who you are 
look  you may have had
three ways with dudes
or smoked cocaine 
but if you had 
just because you didn t
disclose that to me 
doesn t mean
you re a liar 
i don t care what
you did before we met 
all i care about
is who you are now 
really 
so if i was a pedophile 
if i had raped children 
you wouldn t care about that 
if i had been a member of
the ku klux klan  no biggie 
you wouldn t feel like
a complete idiot for having
fallen in love with me 
buddy  i   
i m sorry  i m sorry 
i was ashamed 
and i was embarrassed 
and i thought we would
just live in milton for
the rest of our lives
and be happy
and have babies 
and i would be charlie 
and that would be that 
what if i did tell you 
be honest 
would you have
fallen in love with me 
i don t know 
and i m never gonna know 
because you took that
decision away from me 
but yes  charlie 
i find it very difficult
to believe
that someone who
justified robbing 13 banks
would ever not be
that type of person 
it s not exactly
the high profile
background you look for
when you re choosing
someone to have a baby with 
you know 
if i was an ex drug addict
or an ex alcoholic 
i guarantee
you would be able
to look past that 
that s not the point 
the bottom line is
in any relationship
you can either wallow
in the person s past 
or you can look
at the person that s
right in front of you
and choose
to move forward 
but you can t do both 
i agree 
then move forward with me 
but the person in
front of me lied to me 
whether you want to call
it that or not  charlie 
i need to get to l a 
and i m gonna do
that without you 
how 
hey 
hey 
are you okay 
yeah  i m fine 
can you  um   
can you drive me
the rest of the way
to l a   please 
of course 
or would you rather
go back to our house
and digest all this 
no  gil 
i just want
to get to l a 
i can do that 
why don t you hop in
and i ll gather
all your belongings 
okay 
hey  asshole 
do not even think about
tailing us  i m serious 
or what  you re gonna
stab me with that knife 
i could  if you charged me 
yeah  okay 
i m terrified 
yeah  well 
you re the aggressor 
listen  i still think
you re a fucking turd 
but i m sorry
that i clocked you
and i appreciate you
taking annie to l a 
you re welcome 
oh  and we know
who got the best
of who in that scuffle 
so  if you forgot 
just ask
your previous shirt 
i will 
gil  you got
your seatbelt on 
he s not answering 
oh  my god

randy

and have a warm meal  or

gil

don t even think about it 
let me go 
gil 
gil  what the fuck

you were inside
the bank and you saw
the security guard
pointing a fucking
gun at allen

you were in the fucking car
trying to change the fucking
oldies station 
i m sure the  6
an hour fucking retard

are you kidding me 
he would have shot me 
you don t fucking know 
shut the fuck up  allen

hey  no  i m being serious 
alex  please listen to me 
you re gonna risk going to
prison when i m cooperating 
i don t get it 
 cause you
owe me  motherfucker 
i want you to feel the
fucking uncomfortable
situation i was in 
you got off 
what are you talking about 
oh  my god  eight months 
are you fucking crazy 
i ve been in siberia
for four years 
the fucking
arrogance of you  man 
i don t understand  what 
you fucking didn t like
the gym equipment 
there wasn t enough
time for you to read 
i got butt fucked 
i got
fucked in the butt
because of you 
yeah 
that s horrible 
i did not realize
that happened in jail 
i thought that
was a prison thing 
yeah  well   
i guess it s not
exclusive to prisons 
well  i mean  you ve never
been  like  a homophobe 
it seems like something
you probably worked through 
you re a strong dude 
i don t think homophobia
has anything to do with it 
the guy was disgusting 
if i was gay
i would still want
to come after you 
i m really sorry 
i m really  really sorry 
was it a black guy 
no  it wasn t a black guy 
that s a pretty fucking
racist thing to say 
you think that s racist 
yeah 
i think that s
the opposite of racist 
i don t think it would
make a black guy gay
to fuck a white dude
because we re such
pussies compared to them 
what the fuck
are you even talking
about right now 
i m saying if i was
a black dude i wouldn t
feel the least bit gay
i would think a white guy is
just like masculine chicks 
like  ellen 
she s masculine 
but i would
totally fuck her
if i were single 
i wasn t fucked
by a black guy 
okay 
can we just go 
okay 
was it a mexican guy 
no 
oh  man 
was it one of
those white guys 
those fucking nazis 
no  it was not
a fucking white guy  either 
charlie 
it doesn t matter who
violated him  okay 
it could have been
any number of people 
it doesn t matter
their race  okay 
it could have
been latino  it could
have been tongan 
it could have
been a persian   
it was filipino 
i was butt fucked by
a filipino dude  okay 
does that fucking
solve your dilemma
of what part of the world
my ass traveled to 
well   
i mean  i don t think   
that s not so bad 
i mean  just like
all black dudes
think of us as women 
i think of all asians
as women  you know 
even the men 
i feel like you
basically hooked up
with an asian lady 
charlie  just   
no  i didn t hook up with
anybody  bro  i was raped 
okay  listen  i don t   
fucking hooked up 
i feel partly responsible for this
