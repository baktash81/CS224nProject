thank you kindly
oh watch it
sorry darling
there you are
thank you
master stadle
mind if i join you
ill have the same
i should introduce myself
my name is gandalf
gandalf the grey
i know who you are
well now this is a fine chance
what brings thorin
oakenshield to bree
i received word that my father
had been seen wandering
the wilds near dunland
i went looking
i found no sign of him
thorin its been a long time
since anything but
rumor was heard
of thrain
he still lives
i am sure of it
my father came to see you
before he went missing
what did you say to him
i urged him to march
upon erebor to rally
the seven armies of the dwarves
to destroy the dragon
and take back
the lonely mountain
and i would say the same to you
take back your homeland
this is no chance meeting
is it gandalf
no
it is not
the lonely mountain troubles me
thorin that dragon has
sat there long enough
sooner or later
darker minds will
turn towards erebor
i ran into some
unsavory characters
whilst traveling on the greenway
they mistook me for a vagabond
i imagine they regretted that
one of them was carrying a message
it is black speech
a promise of payment
for what
your head
someone wants you dead
thorin you can wait no longer
you are
the heir to the throne of durin
unite the armies of the dwarves
together you have the
might and power
to retake erebor
summon a meeting of the
seven dwarf families
demand they stand by their oath
the seven armies swore that oath to
the one who wields the kings jewel
the arkenstone
it is the only thing that will
unite them and in case
you have forgotten
that jewel was stolen by smaug
what if i were to
help you reclaim it
how
the arkenstone lies
half a world away
buried beneath the feet of
a firebreathing dragon
yes it does
which is why were going
to need a burglar
how close is the pack
too close a couple of leagues no more
but thats not the worst of it
have the wargs picked up our scent
not yet but they will do
we have another problem
did they see you
they saw you
no thats not it
what did i tell you
quiet as a mouse
excellent burglar material
will you listen will you just
listen
im trying to tell you there
is something else out there
what form did it take
like a bear
ye yes but bigger
much bigger
you knew about this beast
i say we double back
and be run down by a pack of orcs
there is a house
its not far from here
where we might take refuge
whose house
are they friend or foe
neither
he will help us or
he will kill us
what choice do we have
none
come on
this way quickly
run
bombur come on
to the house
run
come on get inside
open the door
quickly
push
push
dwalin
come on lads
what is
that
that is our host
his name is beorn
and hes a skinchanger
sometimes hes a huge black bear
sometimes hes a great strong man
the bear is unpredictable
but the man can be
reasoned with however
he is not overfond of dwarves
hes leaving
come away from there
its not natural none of it
its obvious hes under some
dark spell
dont be a fool
hes under no enchantment
but his own
all right now get some sleep
all of you
youll be safe here tonight
i hope
so you are the one
they call oakenshield
tell me
why is azog
the defiler hunting you
you know of azog
how
my people were the first to
live in the mountains
before the orcs came
down from the north
the defiler killed
most of my family
but some he
enslaved
not for work you understand
but for sport
caging skinchangers
and torturing them
seemed to amuse him
there are others like you
once there were many
and now
now there is only one
you need to reach
the mountain before the
last days of autumn
before durins day falls
yes
you are running out of time
which is why we must
go through mirkwood
a darkness lies upon that forest
fell things creep
beneath those trees
there is an alliance between
the orcs of moria
and the necromancer in dol guldur
i would not venture there
except in great need
we will take the elven road
that path is still safe
safe
the wood elves of mirkwood
are not like their kin
theyre less wise
and more dangerous
but it matters not
what do you mean
these lands are crawling with orcs
their numbers are growing
and you are on foot
you will never reach
the forest alive
i dont like dwarves
theyre greedy
and blind
blind to the lives of
those they deem
lesser than their own
but orcs i hate more
what do you need
go now while you have the light
your hunters are not far behind
the elven gate
here lies our path
through mirkwood
no sign of the orcs
we have luck on our side
set the ponies loose
let them return to their master
this forest
feels
sick
as if a disease lies upon it
is there no way around
not unless we go 200 miles north
or twice that distance
south
something moves
in the shadows unseen
hidden from our sight
every day it grows in strength
beware the necromancer
he is not what he seems
if our enemy has
returned we must know
go to the tombs in the mountains
the high fells
so be it
not my horse
i need it
youre not leaving us
i would not do this
unless i had to
youve changed
bilbo baggins
youre not the same hobbit
as the one who left the shire
i was going to tell you
i
found something in
the goblin tunnels
found what
what did you find
my courage
good well thats good
youll need it
ill be waiting for you
at the overlook before
the slopes of erebor
keep the map and key safe
do not enter that
mountain without me
this is not the greenwood of old
the very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion
itll seek to enter your
mind and lead you astray
lead us astray
what does that mean
you must stay on
the path do not leave it
if you do youll never
find it again
no matter what may come stay on
the path
come on we must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on durins day
durins day
lets go
it is our one chance
to find the hidden door
the path turns this way
this way
air i need air
my head its swimming
whats happening
keep moving
nori
why have we stopped
the path
its disappeared
whats going on
weve lost the path
find it
all of you look
look for the path
i dont remember this bit
none of its familiar
its got to be here
what hour is it
i do not know i do not
even know what day it is
is there no end
to this accursed forest
attercop
look
a tobacco pouch
theres dwarves in these woods
dwarves from the blue
mountains no less
this is exactly the same as mine
because it is yours
do you understand
were going around in circles
we are lost
we are not lost
we keep heading east
but which way is east
weve lost the sun
i thought you were the expert
the sun
we have to find
the sun
up there
we need to
get above the canopy
what was that
enough quiet all of you
were being watched
i can see a lake
and a river
and the lonely mountain
were almost there
can you hear me
i know which way to go
hello
hello
oh no
oh come on
kill them kill them
eat them now while
their blood is running
their hide is tough
but theres good juice inside
stick it again
stick it again finish it off
the meats alive and kicking
kill him
kill him now
let us feast
feast feast
feast feast
eat them alive
feast
what is it
what is it

fat and juicy
just a
little taste

kili

if you think im giving you
a weapon dwarf
youre mistaken
search them
bey give it back thats private
who is this
your brother
that is
my wife
and what is this horrid creature
a goblinmutant
thats my wee lad gimli
where did you get this
it was given to me
not just a thief
but a liar as well
thorin wheres bilbo
unh this is not the end of it
do you hear me
hey let us out of here
get off me
arent you going to search me
i could have anything
down my trousers
or nothing
again leave it
theres no way out
this is no orc dungeon
these are the halls of
the woodland realm
no one leaves here but
by the kings consent
some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand
a quest to reclaim a homeland
and slay a dragon
i myself suspect a
more prosaic motive
attempted burglary
or something of that ilk
you have found
a way in
you seek that which would
bestow upon you the right to rule
the kings jewel
the arkenstone
it is precious to
you beyond measure
i understand that
there are gems in the
mountain that i too desire
white gems
of pure starlight
i offer you my help
i am listening
i will let you go
if you but return what is mine
a favor for a favor
you have my word
one king to another
i would not trust thranduil
the great king
to honor his word
should the end of all
days be upon us
you
who lack all
honor
i have seen how you
treat your friends
we came to you once
starving homeless
seeking your help
but you turned your back
you turned away from the
suffering of my people
and the inferno that destroyed us
do not talk to me of dragon fire
i know
its wrath and ruin
i have faced
the great serpents of the north
i warned your
grandfather of what his
greed would summon
but he would not listen
you are just like him
stay here if you will
and rot
a hundred years is a mere blink
in the life of an elf
im patient
i can wait
did he offer you a deal
he did
i told him he could go
ish kakhf√© aidurrugnu
him and all his kin
well thats that then
a deal was our only hope
not our only hope
i know youre there
why do you linger in the shadows
i was coming to report to you
i thought i ordered that nest to
be destroyed not two moons past
we cleared
the forest as ordered my lord
but more spiders keep
coming up from the south
they are spawning in
the ruins of dol guldur if we
could kill them at their source
that fortress lies
beyond our borders
keep our lands clear of those
foul creatures that is your task
and when we drive
them off what then
will they not spread
to other lands
other lands are not my concern
the fortunes of the world
will rise and fall
but here in this
kingdom we will endure
legolas said you fought well today
he has grown very fond of you
i assure you my lord
legolas thinks of me as no more
than a captain of the guard
perhaps he did once
now i am not so sure
i do not think you would
allow your son
to pledge himself to
a lowly silvan elf
no you are right i would not
still he cares about you
do not give him hope
where there is none
the stone in your hand what is it
it is a talisman
a powerful spell lies upon it
if any but a dwarf reads
the runes on this stone
they will be forever cursed
or not
depending on whether you believe in
that kind of thing its just a token
a rune stone
my mother
gave it to me so id
remember my promise
what promise
that i would come back to her
she worries
she thinks im reckless
are you
nah
sounds like quite a party
youre having up there
it is mereth engilith
the feast of starlight
all light is sacred to the eldar
but wood elves love best
the light of the stars
i always thought it
is a cold light
remote and far away
it is memory
precious and pure
like your promise
i have walked there sometimes
beyond the forest
and up into the night
i have seen the world fall away
and the white light of
forever fill the air
i saw a fire moon once
it rose over the pass
near dunland huge
red and gold it was
it filled the sky
we were an escort for some merchants
from ered luin they were
trading in silverwork for furs
we took the greenway south
keeping the mountain to our left
and then it appeared
this huge fire moon
lighting our path
i wish i could show
you the caverns
galion you old rogue
were running out of drink
these empty barrels should have been
sent back to esgaroth hours ago
the bargeman will be
waiting for them
say what you like about our
illtempered king he has
excellent taste in wine
come elros try it
i have the dwarves
in my charge
theyre locked up
where can they go ha ha
ill wager the sun is on the rise
must be nearly dawn
were never gonna reach
the mountain are we
not stuck in here youre not

kili

nori
cut the log
bombur
tauriel
oh its you
why am i here gandalf
trust me radagast
i would not have called you
here without good reason
this is not a nice place to meet
no
it is not
these are dark spells gandalf
old and full of hate
whos buried here
if he had a name
its long since been lost
he would have been known only
as a servant of evil
one of a number
one of nine
why now gandalf
i dont understand
the ringwraiths
have been summoned to dol guldur
but it cannot be the necromancer
a human sorcerer could
not summon such evil
who said it was human
the nine only answer to one master
weve been blind radagast
and in our blindness
the enemy has returned
he is summoning his servants
azog the defiler
is no ordinary hunter
he is a commander
a commander of legions
the enemy is preparing for war
it will begin in the east
his mind is set upon that mountain
where are you going
to rejoin the others
gandalf
i started this
i cannot forsake them
they are in grave danger
if what you say is true
the world is in grave danger
the power in that fortress
will only grow stronger
you want me to cast
my friends aside
anything behind us
not that i can see
i think weve outrun the orcs
not for long weve lost the current
bomburs half drowned
make for the shore
aye
come on lets go
gloin help me my brother
come on lift yourself
come on
come on you big lump you
im fine its nothing
on your feet
kilts wounded
his leg needs binding
theres an orc pack on our tail
we keep moving
to where
to the mountain were so close
a lake lies between
us and that mountain
we have no way to cross it
so then we go around
the orcs will run us down
as sure as daylight
weve no weapons to
defend ourselves
bind his leg quickly
you have two minutes
do it again
and youre dead
excuse me
but youre from laketown
if im not mistaken
that barge over there
it wouldnt be available
for hire by any chance
what makes you think
i would help you
those boots have seen better days
as has that coat
no doubt you have some
hungry mouths to feed
how many bairns
a boy and two girls
and your wife
i imagine shes a beauty
aye
she was
im sorry i didnt mean to
oh come on come on
enough of the niceties
whats your hurry
whats it to you
i would like to know who you are
and what you are doing
in these lands
we are simple merchants
from the blue mountains
journeying to see our kin
in the iron hills
simple merchants you say
we need food
supplies weapons
can you help us
i know where these
barrels came from
what of it
i dont know what business
you had with the elves
but i dont think it ended well
no one enters laketown
but by leave of the master
all his wealth comes from trade
with the woodland realm
he would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of king thranduil
offer him more
ill wager there are
ways to enter that town unseen
aye
but for that
you would need a smuggler
for which we would pay double
such is the nature
of evil out there in
the vast ignorance of the world
it festers and spreads
a shadow that grows in the dark
a sleepless malice as black
as the oncoming wall of night
so it ever was
so will it always be
in time all foul
things come forth
you were tracking
a company of 13 dwarves
why
not 13
not anymore
the young one
the blackhaired archer
we stuck him with a morgul shaft
the poisons in his blood
hell be
choking on it soon
answer the question filth
i would not antagonize her
you like killing things orc
you like death
then let me give it to you
i do not care about one
dead dwarf answer the question
you have nothing to fear
tell us
what you know and i
will set you free
you had orders to kill them why
what is thorin oakenshield to you
the dwarf runt will never be king
king
there is no king under the
mountain nor will there ever be
none would dare enter erebor
whilst the dragon lives
you know nothing
your world will burn
what are you talking about
speak
our time has come again
my master serves the one
do you understand now elfling
death is upon you
the flames of war
are upon you
why did you do that
you promised to set him free
and i did
i freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders
there was more
the orc could tell us
there was nothing more
he could tell me
what did he mean by
the flames of war
it means they intend to
unleash a weapon so great
it will destroy all before it
i want the watch doubled at our borders
all roads all rivers
nothing moves but i hear of it
no one enters this kingdom
and no one leaves it
watch out
what are you trying
to do drown us
i was born and bred on these
waters master dwarf
if i wanted to drown you
i would not do it here
oh ive had enough of
this lippy lakeman
i say we throw him over the
side and be done with it
bard his names bard
how do you know
uh i asked him
i dont care what he calls himself
i dont like him
we do not have to like him
we simply have to pay him
come on now lads turn out
your pockets
how do we know he wont betray us
we dont
theres
just a wee problem
were 10 coins short
gloin
come on
give us what you have
dont look to me
i have been bled dry
by this venture
what have i seen
for my investment
naught but misery and
grief and
bless my beard
take it
take all of it
ahem
the money quick give it to me
we will pay you when we get
our provisions but not before
if you value your freedom
youll do as i say
there are guards ahead
whats he doing
hes talking to someone
hes pointing right at us
now theyre
shaking hands
what
the villain
hes selling us out
quiet
were approaching the tollgate
halt
goods inspection
papers please
oh its you bard
morning percy
anything to declare
nothing but that i
am cold and tired
and ready for home
you and me both
there we are
all in order
not so fast
consignment of empty barrels
from the woodland realm
only
theyre not empty
are they bard
if i recall correctly
youre licensed as a bargeman
not
a fisherman
thats none of your business
wrong
its the masters business
which makes it my business
oh come on alfrid have a heart
people need to eat
these fish are illegal
empty the barrels
over the side
you heard him in the canal
come on get a move on
folk in this town are struggling
times are hard
food is scarce
thats not my problem
and when the people hear the master
is dumping fish back in the lake
when the rioting starts
will it be your problem then
stop
ever the peoples champion
eh bard protector of
the common folk
you might have their
favor now bargeman
but it wont last
raise the gate
the master has his eye on you
youd do well to remember
we know where you live
its a small town alfrid
everyone knows where
everyone lives
all this talk of civil unrest
someones been stirring
the pot sire
gout playing up sire
its the damp
its the only possible explanation
get me a brandy
the mood of the people
sire its turning ugly
theyre commoners alfrid
theyve always been ugly
its not my fault they
live in a place
that stinks of fish oil and tar
jobs shelter food
its all they ever bleat about
its my belief sire they are
being led on by troublemakers
then we must find these
troublemakers and arrest them
my thoughts exactly sire
and all this talk of
change must be suppressed
cant afford to let the
rabble band together
and start making noises
the next thing
you know theyll start
asking questions
forming committees
launching inquiries
out with the old in with the new
what
thats what theyve
been saying sire
there is even talk
of an election
an election heh
thats absurd
i wont stand for it ha
i dont think theyd ask
you to stand sire
shirkers
ingrates
rabblerousers
who would have the nerve
to question my authority
who would dare
who
bard
you mark my words
that troublemaking bargeman
is behind all this
get your hands off me
you didnt see them
they were never here
the fish you can have for nothing
follow me
da
our house its being watched
you can tell the
master im done for the day
da where have you been
father there you are
i was worried
here sigrid
bain get them in
if you speak of this to anyone
ill rip your arms off
get off
up there
da
why are there dwarves
climbing out of our toilet
will they bring us luck
they may not be the best fit
but theyll keep you warm
thank you very much
a dwarvish windlance
you look like youve seen a ghost
he has
the last time we saw
such a weapon
a city was on fire
it was the day the dragon came
the day that smaug
destroyed dale
girion the lord of the city
rallied his bowmen
to fire upon the beast
but a dragons hide is tough
tougher than the strongest armor
only a black arrow fired
from a windlance
could have pierced
the dragons hide
and few of those
arrows were ever made
the store was running low
when girion
made his last stand
had the aim of men
been true that day
much would have been different
you speak as if you were there
all dwarves know the tale
then you would know that
girion hit the dragon
he loosened a scale
under the left wing
one more shot and he would
have killed the beast
thats a fairy story lad
nothing more
you took our money
where are the weapons
wait here
tomorrow begins
the last days of autumn
durins day falls the
morn after next
we must reach the
mountain before then
and if we do not
if we fail to find the hidden
door before that time
then this quest has
been for nothing
what is this
pike hook
made from an old harpoon
and this
a crowbill we call it
fashioned from a smithys hammer
its heavy in hand i grant
but in defense of your life these
will serve you better than none
we paid
you for weapons
ironforged swords
and axes
its a joke
you wont find better
outside the city armory
all ironforged weapons are
held there under lock and key
thorin
why not take whats
on offer and go
ive made do with less
so have you
i say we leave now
youre not going anywhere
what did you say
there are spies
watching this house
and probably every dock
and wharf in the town
you must wait
till nightfall
thorin
da
dont let them leave
tauriel
you cannot hunt 30 orcs
on your own
but im not on my own
you knew i would come
the king is angry
tauriel for 600 years
my father has protected
you favored you
you defied his orders
you betrayed his trust
the king has never
let orc filth roam our lands
yet he would let this orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners
it is not our fight
it is our fight
it will not end here
with every victory
this evil will grow
if your father has his way
we will do nothing
we will hide within our walls
live our lives away
from the light
and let darkness descend
are we not part of this world
tell me mellon
when did we let evil
become stronger than us
hello bard what you after
there was a tapestry
an old one wheres it gone
what tapestry you talking about
this one
they were dwarves
i tell you appeared
out of nowhere
full beards fierce eyes
ive never seen the like
what are dwarves doing
in these parts
its the prophecy
the prophecy
the prophecy of durins folk
prophecy
prophecy
the old tales will come true
vast halls of treasure
can it really be true
has the lord of silver
fountains returned
the lord of the silver fountains
the king of carven stone
the king beneath the mountain
shall come into his own
and the bell shall ring in gladness
at the mountain
kings return
but all shall fail in sadness
and the lake will shine and burn
da i tried to stop them
how long have they been gone
can you see anything
shh keep it down
as soon as we have the weapons
we make straight for the mountain
go go
go nori
next
you all right
i can manage
lets just get out of here
run
quickly move now
get off me get off
move them along here
move on
what is the meaning of this
we caught them stealing weapons sire
ah
enemies of the state eh
a desperate bunch of
mercenaries if ever
there was sire
hold your tongue
you do not know to whom you speak
this is no common criminal
this is thorin
son of thrain son of thror
we are the dwarves of erebor
we have come to
reclaim our homeland
i remember this town in
the great days of old
fleets of boats lay at harbor
filled with silks and fine gems
this was no forsaken
town on a lake
this was the center of
all trade in the north
i would
see those days return
i would relight the great
forges of the dwarves
and send wealth and riches
flowing once more from
the halls of erebor
death
that is what you will
bring upon us
dragon fire and ruin
if you waken that beast
it will destroy us all
you can listen to this naysayer
but i promise you this
if we succeed
all will share in the
wealth of the mountain
you will have enough gold
to rebuild esgaroth
10 times over
all of you
listen to me
you must listen
have you forgotten
what happened to dale
have you forgotten those
who died in the firestorm
and for what purpose
the blind ambition of
a mountain king
so riven by greed he could not
see beyond his own desire
now now
we must not any of us
be too quick to lay blame
let us
not forget that it was
girion lord of dale
your ancestor
who failed to kill the beast
its true sire
we all know the story
arrow after arrow he shot
each one missing its mark
you have no right
no right to enter that mountain
i have the only right
i speak to the master
of the men of the lake
will you see the
prophecy fulfilled
will you
share in the great
wealth of our people
what say you
i say unto you
welcome
welcome
and thrice
welcome
king under the mountain
you do know were
one short wheres bofur
if hes not here we leave him behind
well have to
if were to find the door before

on no account were we to
do you see him
we have no time
to wait upon the wizard

dol guldur
the hill of sorcery
it looks completely abandoned
as it is meant to
a spell of concealment
lies over this place
which means
our enemy is not yet
ready to reveal himself
he has not regained
his full strength
radagast i need you to carry
a message to the lady galadriel
tell her we must force his hand
what do you mean
im going in alone

if the map is true
then the hidden door
lies directly above us
up here
you have keen eyes master baggins
this must be it
the hidden door
let all those who doubted us
rue this day
right then we have a key
which means that somewhere
there is a keyhole

one chance

well
thief
i smell you
i hear your breath
i feel
your air
where are you
where are you
come now
dont be shy
step into the light
hmm
there is something about you
something you
carry
something made of gold
but far more
precious
precious precious
there you are
thief in the
shadows
i did not come to steal from you
o smaug
the unassessably wealthy
i merely wanted
to gaze upon your magnificence
to see
if you really were as great
as the old tales say
i did not believe them
and do you now
truly
the tales and songs
fall utterly short
of your enormity
o smaug the stupendous
do you think flattery
will keep you alive
no no
no indeed
you seem familiar with my name
but i dont remember
smelling your kind before
who are you
and where do you come from
may i ask
i come from under the hill
underhill
and under hills
and over hills my path has led
and and
through the air
i am he who walks unseen
impressive
what else do you claim to be
i am
luckwearer
riddlemaker
lovely titles
go on
barrelrider
barrels now that is interesting
and what about
your little dwarf friends
where are they hiding
dwarves
no
no no no dwarves here
youve got that all wrong
oh i dont think so barrelrider
they sent you in here
to do their dirty
work while they
skulk about outside
truly
you are mistaken
o smaug chiefest and
greatest of calamities
you have nice manners
for a thief and
a liar
i know the smell and
taste of dwarf
no one better
it is the gold
they are drawn
to treasure like
flies to dead flesh
did you think i did not know
this day would come
that a pack of
canting dwarves
would come crawling back
to the mountain
was that an earthquake
that my lad
was a dragon
da
its coming from the mountain
you should leave us
take your children
get out of here
and go where
there is nowhere to go
are we going to die da
no darling
the dragon
its going to kill us
not if i kill it first
the king under the
mountain is dead
i took his throne
i ate his
people like a wolf among sheep
i kill where
i wish when
i wish
my armor is iron
no blade can pierce me
all right
a black arrow
why did you never tell me
because you did not need to know
listen to me carefully
i need you to distract the guards
once im at the top of the tower
ill set the arrow to the bow
there he is
bard
after him
quickly down there go
stop him
stop him
stop
bain bain
keep it safe dont let anyone
find it ill deal with them
im not leaving you
now go
braga
youre under arrest
on what charge
any charge the master chooses
wheres he gone
what about bilbo
give him more time
time to do what to be killed
youre afraid
yes im afraid
i fear for you
a sickness lies upon
that treasure hoard
a sickness which drove
your grandfather mad
i am not my grandfather
youre not yourself
the thorin i know would not
hesitate to go in there
i will not risk this
quest for the life of one burglar
bilbo
his name is bilbo
its oakenshield
that filthy dwarvish usurper
he sent you in here
for the arkenstone didnt he
no no
no i dont know what
youre talking about
dont bother denying it
i guessed his foul
purpose some time ago
but it matters not
oakenshields quest will fail
the darkness is coming
it will spread to every
corner of the land
you are being used thief
in the shadows you were only
ever a means to an end
the coward
oakenshield has weighed
the value of your life
and found it worth nothing
no
no
no youre lying
what did he promise you
a share of the treasure
as if it was his
to give
i will not part with
a single coin
not one piece of it
my teeth
are swords
my claws are spears
my wings
are a hurricane
so it is true
the black arrow found its mark
what did you say
i was just saying your reputation
precedes you o smaug
the tyrannical
truly
you have no equal on this earth
i am
almost tempted to let you take it
if only to see oakenshield
suffer
watch it
destroy him
watch it corrupt his heart
and drive him mad
but i think not
i think our little game ends here
so tell me
thief
how do you choose to die
nah
da is that you da
aah
stay down
get down
you killed them all
there are others
tauriel
come
were losing him
tauriel
athelas
athelas
what are you doing
im going to save him
youre alive
not for much longer
did you find the arkenstone
the arkenstone
the dragons coming

we have to get out
thorin
thorin
you will burn
run
ah
come on bilbo
come on
hold him down
unh tilda
shh shh shh
weve given him the slip
no
hes too cunning for that
so where to now
the western guardroom
there may be a way out
its too high theres no chance
that way
its our only chance
we have to try
come on
ive heard tell of the
wonders of elvish medicine
that was a privilege to witness
tauriel
lie still
you cannot be her
she is far away
she is far
far away from me
she walks
in starlight in another world
it was just a dream
do you think she couldve loved me
stay close
thats it then
theres no way out
the last of our kin
they must have come here
hoping
beyond hope
we could try to reach the mines
we might last a few days
no
i will not die like this
cowering
clawing for breath
we make for the forges
hell see us sure as death
not if we split up
thorin
well never make it
some of us might
lead him to the forges
we kill the dragon
if this is to end in fire
then we will all burn together
this way
flee
flee
run for your lives
there is
nowhere to hide
behind you
worm
come on
run
hey you
here
this way its this way
come on
thorin

gallery of the kings
keep going bilbo
run
you think you
can deceive me barrelrider
you have come from laketown
this is some
sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy dwarves
and those miserable
tubtrading lakemen
those sniveling cowards
with their long bows
and black arrows
perhaps it is time
i paid them a visit
oh no
this isnt their fault
wait
you cannot go to laketown
you care about them
you
good
then you can
watch them die
here
you witless worm
you
i am taking back what you stole
you
will take nothing
from me
dwarf
i laid low your warriors
of old
i instilled terror in
the hearts of men
i am
king under
the mountain
this is not your kingdom
these are dwarf lands
this is dwarf gold
and we will
have our revenge
revenge
revenge
i will show you revenge
listen to me
