  thank you kindly 
  oh  watch it 
  sorry  darling 
  there you are 
  thank you 
master stadle 
mind if i join you 
i ll have the same 
i should introduce myself 
my name is gandalf 
gandalf the grey 
i know who you are 
well  now  this is a fine chance 
what brings thorin
oakenshield to bree 
i received word that my father   
had been seen wandering
the wilds near dunland 
i went looking 
i found no sign of him 
thorin  it s been a long time   
since anything but
rumor was heard   
of thrain 
he still lives 
i am sure of it 
my father came to see you
before he went missing 
what did you say to him 
i urged him to march
upon erebor  to rally   
the seven armies of the dwarves   
to destroy the dragon
and take back   
the lonely mountain 
and i would say the same to you 
take back your homeland 
this is no chance meeting 
is it  gandalf 
no 
it is not 
the lonely mountain troubles me   
thorin  that dragon has
sat there long enough 
sooner or later   
darker minds will
turn towards erebor 
i ran into some
unsavory characters   
whilst traveling on the greenway 
they mistook me for a vagabond 
i imagine they regretted that 
one of them was carrying a message 
it is black speech 
a promise of payment 
for what 
your head 
someone wants you dead 
thorin  you can wait no longer 
you are   
the heir to the throne of durin 
unite the armies of the dwarves 
together  you have the
might and power   
to retake erebor 
summon a meeting of the
seven dwarf families 
demand they stand by their oath 
the seven armies swore that oath to
the one who wields the king s jewel 
the arkenstone 
it is the only thing that will   
unite them  and in case
you have forgotten   
that jewel was stolen by smaug 
what if i were to
help you reclaim it 
how 
the arkenstone lies
half a world away   
buried beneath the feet of
a fire breathing dragon 
yes  it does 
which is why we re going
to need a burglar 
how close is the pack 
too close  a couple of leagues  no more 
but that s not the worst of it 
  have the wargs picked up our scent 
  not yet  but they will do 
  we have another problem 
  did they see you 
they saw you 
no  that s not it 
what did i tell you 
quiet as a mouse 
excellent burglar material 
will you listen  will you just   
listen 
i m trying to tell you there
is something else out there 
what form did it take 
like a bear 
ye    yes  but bigger 
much bigger 
you knew about this beast 
i say we double back 
and be run down by a pack of orcs 
there is a house   
it s not far from here 
where we might take refuge 
whose house 
are they friend or foe 
neither 
he will help us or   
he will kill us 
what choice do we have 
none 
come on 
this way  quickly 
run 
bombur  come on 
to the house 
run 
come on  get inside 
open the door 
quickly 
  push 
  push 
dwalin 
come on  lads 
what is   
that 
that is our host 
his name is beorn 
and he s a skin changer 
sometimes he s a huge black bear 
sometimes he s a great strong man 
the bear is unpredictable   
but the man can be
reasoned with  however   
he is not overfond of dwarves 
he s leaving 
come away from there 
it s not natural  none of it 
it s obvious  he s under some   
dark spell 
don t be a fool 
he s under no enchantment
but his own 
all right  now get some sleep 
all of you 
you ll be safe here tonight 
i hope 
so you are the one
they call oakenshield 
tell me   
why is azog   
the defiler hunting you 
you know of azog 
how 
my people were the first to
live in the mountains   
before the orcs came
down from the north 
the defiler killed
most of my family 
but some he   
enslaved 
not for work  you understand   
but for sport 
caging skin changers   
and torturing them
seemed to amuse him 
there are others like you 
once there were many 
and now 
now there is only one 
you need to reach   
the mountain before the
last days of autumn 
before durin s day falls 
yes 
you are running out of time 
which is why we must
go through mirkwood 
a darkness lies upon that forest 
fell things creep
beneath those trees 
there is an alliance between
the orcs of moria   
and the necromancer in dol guldur 
i would not venture there   
except in great need 
we will take the elven road 
that path is still safe 
 safe  
the wood elves of mirkwood   
are not like their kin 
they re less wise   
and more dangerous 
but it matters not 
what do you mean 
these lands are crawling with orcs 
their numbers are growing 
and you are on foot 
you will never reach   
the forest alive 
i don t like dwarves 
they re greedy   
and blind 
blind to the lives of
those they deem   
lesser than their own 
but orcs i hate more 
what do you need 
go now  while you have the light 
your hunters are not far behind 
the elven gate 
here lies our path   
through mirkwood 
no sign of the orcs 
we have luck on our side 
set the ponies loose 
let them return to their master 
this forest   
feels   
sick 
as if a disease lies upon it 
is there no way around 
not unless we go 200 miles north 
or twice that distance   
south 
something moves
in the shadows unseen   
hidden from our sight 
every day it grows in strength 
beware the necromancer 
he is not what he seems 
if our enemy has
returned  we must know 
go to the tombs in the mountains 
the high fells 
so be it 
not my horse 
i need it 
you re not leaving us 
i would not do this
unless i had to 
you ve changed   
bilbo baggins 
you re not the same hobbit
as the one who left the shire 
i was going to tell you 
i   
found something in
the goblin tunnels 
found what 
what did you find 
my courage 
good  well  that s good 
you ll need it 
i ll be waiting for you
at the overlook  before   
the slopes of erebor 
keep the map and key safe 
do not enter that
mountain without me 
this is not the greenwood of old 
the very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion 
it ll seek to enter your
mind and lead you astray 
 lead us astray  
what does that mean 
you must stay on
the path  do not leave it 
if you do  you ll never   
find it again 
no matter what may come  stay on   
the path 
come on  we must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on durin s day 
  durin s day 
  let s go 
it is our one chance
to find the hidden door 
the path turns this way 
this way 
air  i need air 
my head  it s swimming 
what s happening 
keep moving 
nori   
why have we stopped 
the path   
it s disappeared 
what s going on 
we ve lost the path 
find it 
all of you  look 
look for the path 
i don t remember this bit 
none of it s familiar 
it s got to be here 
what hour is it 
i do not know  i do not
even know what day it is 
is there no end
to this accursed forest  
attercop 
look 
a tobacco pouch 
there s dwarves in these woods 
dwarves from the blue
mountains  no less 
this is exactly the same as mine 
because it is yours 
do you understand 
we re going around in circles 
we are lost 
we are not lost 
we keep heading east 
but which way is east 
we ve lost the sun 
i thought you were the expert 
the sun 
we have to find   
the sun 
up there 
we need to   
get above the canopy 
what was that 
enough  quiet  all of you 
we re being watched 
i can see a lake 
and a river 
and the lonely mountain 
we re almost there 
can you hear me 
i know which way to go 
hello 
hello 
oh  no 
oh  come on 
kill them  kill them 
eat them now  while
their blood is running 
their hide is tough 
but there s good juice inside 
stick it again 
stick it again  finish it off 
the meat s alive and kicking 
kill him 
kill him now 
let us feast 
feast  feast 
feast  feast 
eat them alive 
feast 
  what is it 
  what is it 
eat them alive 
fat and juicy 
just a   
little taste 
curse it  where is it  
where is it  
here 
ah  it stings 
it stings 
sting 
that s a good name 
sting 
you all right there  bofur 
  i m all right

where s bilbo 
i m up here 
grab the legs 
pull

where is it  where is it  come on

thorin  get them 
come on 
look out  brother 
fili 
mine 
come on   
keep up 
we re clear 
do not think i won t
kill you  dwarf 
it would be my pleasure 
  help 
  kili 
throw me a dagger 
quick 
if you think i m giving you   
a weapon  dwarf   
you re mistaken 
search them 
b ey  give it back  that s private 
who is this 
  your brother 
  that is   
my wife 
and what is this horrid creature 
a goblin mutant 
that s my wee lad  gimli 
where did you get this 
it was given to me 
not just a thief 
but a liar as well 
thorin  where s bilbo 
unh  this is not the end of it 
  do you hear me  
  hey  let us out of here 
get off me 
aren t you going to search me 
i could have anything
down my trousers 
or nothing 
again  leave it 
there s no way out 
this is no orc dungeon 
these are the halls of
the woodland realm 
no one leaves here but
by the king s consent 
some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand 
a quest to reclaim a homeland   
and slay a dragon 
i myself suspect a
more prosaic motive 
attempted burglary 
or something of that ilk 
you have found   
a way in 
you seek that which would   
bestow upon you the right to rule 
the king s jewel 
the arkenstone 
it is precious to
you beyond measure 
i understand that 
there are gems in the
mountain that i too desire 
white gems   
of pure starlight 
i offer you my help 
i am listening 
i will let you go   
if you but return what is mine 
a favor for a favor 
you have my word 
one king to another 
i would not trust thranduil   
the great king   
to honor his word   
should the end of all
days be upon us 
you   
who lack all   
honor 
i have seen how you
treat your friends 
we came to you once 
starving  homeless   
seeking your help 
but you turned your back 
you turned away from the
suffering of my people   
and the inferno that destroyed us 
do not talk to me of dragon fire 
i know   
its wrath and ruin 
i have faced   
the great serpents of the north 
i warned your   
grandfather of what his
greed would summon 
but he would not listen 
you are just like him 
stay here if you will   
and rot 
a hundred years is a mere blink   
in the life of an elf 
i m patient 
i can wait 
did he offer you a deal 
he did 
i told him he could go
ish kakhfé ai  dur rugnu 
him and all his kin 
well  that s that  then 
a deal was our only hope 
not our only hope 
i know you re there 
why do you linger in the shadows 
i was coming to report to you 
i thought i ordered that nest to
be destroyed not two moons past 
we cleared   
the forest as ordered  my lord 
but more spiders keep   
coming up from the south 
they are spawning in   
the ruins of dol guldur  if we
could kill them at their source   
that fortress lies
beyond our borders 
keep our lands clear of those
foul creatures  that is your task 
and when we drive
them off  what then 
will they not spread
to other lands 
other lands are not my concern 
the fortunes of the world   
will rise and fall 
but here in this   
kingdom  we will endure 
legolas said you fought well today 
he has grown very fond of you 
i assure you  my lord   
legolas thinks of me as no more
than a captain of the guard 
perhaps he did once 
now i am not so sure 
i do not think you would
allow your son   
to pledge himself to
a lowly silvan elf 
no  you are right  i would not 
still  he cares about you 
do not give him hope
where there is none 
the stone in your hand  what is it 
it is a talisman 
a powerful spell lies upon it 
if any but a dwarf reads
the runes on this stone   
they will be forever cursed 
or not 
depending on whether you believe in
that kind of thing  it s just a token 
a rune stone 
my mother   
gave it to me so i d
remember my promise 
what promise 
that i would come back to her 
she worries 
she thinks i m reckless 
are you 
nah 
sounds like quite a party   
you re having up there 
it is mereth e ngilith   
the feast of starlight 
all light is sacred to the eldar 
but wood elves love best
the light of the stars 
i always thought it
is a cold light 
remote and far away 
it is memory   
precious and pure 
like your promise 
i have walked there sometimes 
beyond the forest   
and up into the night 
i have seen the world fall away   
and the white light of
forever fill the air 
i saw a fire moon once 
it rose over the pass
near dunland  huge 
red and gold  it was 
it filled the sky 
we were an escort for some merchants
from ered luin  they were   
trading in silverwork for furs 
we took the greenway south   
keeping the mountain to our left 
and then it appeared 
this huge fire moon   
lighting our path 
i wish i could show
you the caverns 
galion  you old rogue 
we re running out of drink 
these empty barrels should have been
sent back to esgaroth hours ago 
the bargeman will be
waiting for them 
say what you like about our   
ill tempered king  he has
excellent taste in wine 
come  elros  try it 
i have the dwarves   
in my charge 
they re locked up 
where can they go  ha  ha 
i ll wager the sun is on the rise 
must be nearly dawn 
we re never gonna reach
the mountain  are we 
not stuck in here  you re not 
bilbo 
what 
shh  there are guards nearby 
  ha  ha  ha

you were supposed to be leading

i know what i m doing

everyone

oh  it s you 
why am i here  gandalf 
trust me  radagast 
i would not have called you
here without good reason 
this is not a nice place to meet 
no 
it is not 
these are dark spells  gandalf 
old and full of hate 
who s buried here 
if he had a name 
it s long since been lost 
he would have been known only   
as a servant of evil 
one of a number 
one of nine 
why now  gandalf 
i don t understand 
the ringwraiths   
have been summoned to dol guldur 
but it cannot be the necromancer 
a human sorcerer could
not summon such evil 
who said it was human 
the nine only answer to one master 
we ve been blind  radagast 
and in our blindness   
the enemy has returned 
he is summoning his servants 
azog the defiler   
is no ordinary hunter 
he is a commander 
a commander of legions 
the enemy is preparing for war 
it will begin in the east 
his mind is set upon that mountain 
  where are you going 
  to rejoin the others 
gandalf 
i started this 
i cannot forsake them 
they are in grave danger 
if what you say is true   
the world is in grave danger 
the power in that fortress
will only grow stronger 
you want me to cast
my friends aside 
  anything behind us 
  not that i can see 
  i think we ve outrun the orcs 
  not for long  we ve lost the current 
bombur s half drowned 
  make for the shore 
  aye 
come on  let s go 
gloin  help me  my brother 
come on  lift yourself 
come on 
come on  you big lump  you 
i m fine  it s nothing 
on your feet 
kilt s wounded 
his leg needs binding 
there s an orc pack on our tail 
we keep moving 
to where 
to the mountain  we re so close 
a lake lies between
us and that mountain 
  we have no way to cross it 
  so then we go around 
the orcs will run us down 
as sure as daylight 
we ve no weapons to
defend ourselves 
bind his leg  quickly 
you have two minutes 
do it again   
and you re dead 
excuse me   
but you re from lake town 
if i m not mistaken 
that barge over there   
it wouldn t be available
for hire  by any chance 
what makes you think
i would help you 
those boots have seen better days 
as has that coat 
no doubt you have some
hungry mouths to feed 
how many bairns 
a boy and two girls 
and your wife 
i imagine she s a beauty 
aye 
she was 
i m sorry  i didn t mean to   
oh  come on  come on 
enough of the niceties 
what s your hurry 
what s it to you 
i would like to know who you are   
and what you are doing
in these lands 
we are simple merchants
from the blue mountains   
journeying to see our kin   
in the iron hills 
simple merchants  you say 
we need food   
supplies  weapons 
can you help us 
i know where these
barrels came from 
what of it 
i don t know what business
you had with the elves   
but i don t think it ended well 
no one enters lake town
but by leave of the master 
all his wealth comes from trade
with the woodland realm 
he would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of king thranduil 
offer him more 
i ll wager there are
ways to enter that town unseen 
aye 
but for that   
you would need a smuggler 
for which we would pay double 
such is the nature
of evil  out there in   
the vast ignorance of the world   
it festers and spreads 
a shadow that grows in the dark 
a sleepless malice as black   
as the oncoming wall of night 
so it ever was 
so will it always be 
in time  all foul
things come forth 
you were tracking
a company of 13 dwarves 
why 
not 13 
not anymore 
the young one   
the black haired archer   
we stuck him with a morgul shaft 
the poison s in his blood 
he ll be   
choking on it soon 
answer the question  filth 
i would not antagonize her 
you like killing things  orc 
you like death 
then let me give it to you 
i do not care about one   
dead dwarf  answer the question 
you have nothing to fear 
tell us   
what you know and i
will set you free 
you had orders to kill them  why 
what is thorin oakenshield to you 
the dwarf runt will never be king 
king 
there is no king under the
mountain  nor will there ever be 
none would dare enter erebor   
whilst the dragon lives 
you know nothing 
your world will burn 
what are you talking about 
speak 
our time has come again 
my master serves the one 
do you understand now  elfling 
death is upon you 
the flames of war   
are upon you 
why did you do that 
you promised to set him free 
and i did 
i freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders 
there was more
the orc could tell us 
there was nothing more
he could tell me 
what did he mean by
 the flames of war  
it means they intend to
unleash a weapon so great   
it will destroy all before it 
i want the watch doubled at our borders 
all roads  all rivers 
nothing moves  but i hear of it 
no one enters this kingdom 
and no one leaves it 
watch out 
what are you trying
to do  drown us 
i was born and bred on these
waters  master dwarf 
if i wanted to drown you   
i would not do it here 
oh  i ve had enough of
this lippy lakeman 
i say we throw him over the
side and be done with it 
  bard  his name s bard 
  how do you know 
uh  i asked him 
i don t care what he calls himself 
i don t like him 
we do not have to like him 
we simply have to pay him 
come on now  lads  turn out   
your pockets 
how do we know he won t betray us 
we don t 
there s   
just a wee problem 
we re 10 coins short 
gloin 
come on 
  give us what you have 
  don t look to me 
i have been bled dry   
by this venture 
what have i seen   
for my investment 
naught but misery and   
grief and   
bless my beard 
take it 
  take all of it 
  ahem 
the money  quick  give it to me 
we will pay you when we get
our provisions but not before 
if you value your freedom 
you ll do as i say 
there are guards ahead 
what s he doing 
he s talking to someone 
he s pointing right at us 
now they re   
shaking hands 
  what 
  the villain 
he s selling us out 
quiet 
we re approaching the tollgate 
halt 
goods inspection 
papers  please 
oh  it s you  bard

am cold and tired   
and ready for home 
you and me both 
there we are 
all in order 
not so fast 
 consignment of empty barrels
from the woodland realm  
only   
they re not empty   
are they  bard 
if i recall correctly   
you re licensed as a bargeman 
not   
a fisherman 
that s none of your business 
wrong 
it s the master s business 
which makes it my business 
oh  come on  alfrid  have a heart 
people need to eat 
these fish are illegal 
empty the barrels   
     over the side 
  you heard him  in the canal 
come on  get a move on 
folk in this town are struggling 
times are hard 
food is scarce 
that s not my problem 
and when the people hear the master
is dumping fish back in the lake   
when the rioting starts   
will it be your problem then 
stop 
ever the people s champion   
eh  bard  protector of   
the common folk 
you might have their
favor now  bargeman   
but it won t last 
raise the gate 
the master has his eye on you 
you d do well to remember 
we know where you live 
it s a small town  alfrid 
everyone knows where
everyone lives 
all this talk of civil unrest 
someone s been stirring
the pot  sire 
gout playing up  sire 
it s the damp 
it s the only possible explanation 
get me a brandy 
the mood of the people 
sire  it s turning ugly 
they re commoners  alfrid 
they ve always been ugly 
it s not my fault they
live in a place   
that stinks of fish oil and tar 
jobs  shelter  food 
it s all they ever bleat about 
it s my belief  sire  they are
being led on by troublemakers 
then we must find these   
troublemakers and arrest them 
my thoughts exactly  sire 
and all this talk of
change must be suppressed 
can t afford to let the
rabble band together   
and start making noises 
the next thing   
you know  they ll start
asking questions   
forming committees   
launching inquiries 
out with the old  in with the new 
what 
that s what they ve
been saying  sire 
there is even talk   
of an election 
an election  heh 
that s absurd 
i won t stand for it  ha 
i don t think they d ask
you to stand  sire 
shirkers 
ingrates 
rabble rousers 
who would have the nerve
to question my authority 
who would dare 
who    
bard 
you mark my words

will they bring us luck 
they may not be the best fit
but they ll keep you warm 
thank you very much 
a dwarvish windlance 
you look like you ve seen a ghost 
he has 
the last time we saw   
such a weapon   
a city was on fire 
it was the day the dragon came 
the day that smaug   
destroyed dale 
girion  the lord of the city   
rallied his bowmen   
to fire upon the beast 
but a dragon s hide is tough 
tougher than the strongest armor 
only a black arrow fired
from a windlance   
could have pierced
the dragon s hide 
and few of those   
arrows were ever made 
the store was running low   
when girion   
made his last stand 
had the aim of men
been true that day   
much would have been different 
you speak as if you were there 
all dwarves know the tale 
then you would know that
girion hit the dragon 
he loosened a scale
under the left wing 
one more shot and he would
have killed the beast 
that s a fairy story  lad 
nothing more 
you took our money 
where are the weapons 
wait here 
tomorrow begins
the last days of autumn 
durin s day falls the
morn after next 
we must reach the
mountain before then 
and if we do not 
if we fail to find the hidden
door before that time 
then this quest has
been for nothing 
what is this 
pike hook 
made from an old harpoon 
  and this 
  a crowbill  we call it 
fashioned from a smithy s hammer 
it s heavy in hand  i grant   
but in defense of your life  these
will serve you better than none 
we paid   
you for weapons 
iron forged swords   
and axes 
it s a joke 
you won t find better
outside the city armory 
all iron forged weapons are
held there under lock and key 
thorin   
why not take what s   
on offer and go 
i ve made do with less 
so have you 
  i say we leave now 
  you re not going anywhere 
what did you say 
there are spies
watching this house   
and probably every dock
and wharf in the town 
you must wait   
till nightfall 
thorin 
da 
don t let them leave 
tauriel   
you cannot hunt 30 orcs   
on your own 
but i m not on my own 
you knew i would come 
the king is angry   
tauriel  for 600 years   
my father has protected
you  favored you 
you defied his orders 
you betrayed his trust 
the king has never
let orc filth roam our lands 
yet he would let this orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners 
it is not our fight 
it is our fight 
it will not end here 
with every victory 
this evil will grow 
if your father has his way 
we will do nothing 
we will hide within our walls   
live our lives away
from the light   
and let darkness descend 
are we not part of this world 
tell me  mellon 
when did we let evil
become stronger than us 
hello  bard  what you after 
there was a tapestry 
an old one  where s it gone 
what tapestry you talking about 
this one 
they were dwarves 
i tell you  appeared   
out of nowhere 
full beards  fierce eyes 
i ve never seen the like 
what are dwarves doing
in these parts 
  it s the prophecy 
  the prophecy 
the prophecy of durin s folk 
prophecy 
prophecy 
the old tales will come true 
vast halls of treasure 
can it really be true 
has the lord of silver
fountains returned 
the lord of the silver fountains
the king of carven stone
the king beneath the mountain
shall come into his own 
and the bell shall ring in gladness
at the mountain
king s return
but all shall fail in sadness
and the lake will shine and burn
da  i tried to stop them 
how long have they been gone 
  can you see anything 
  shh  keep it down 
as soon as we have the weapons 
we make straight for the mountain 
go  go 
go  nori 
next 
you all right 
i can manage 
let s just get out of here 
run 
quickly  move now 
get off me  get off 
move them along here 
move on 
what is the meaning of this 
  we caught them stealing weapons  sire 
  ah 
enemies of the state  eh 
a desperate bunch of   
mercenaries  if ever
there was  sire 
hold your tongue 
you do not know to whom you speak 
this is no common criminal 
this is thorin   
son of thrain  son of thror 
we are the dwarves of erebor 
we have come to
reclaim our homeland 
i remember this town in
the great days of old 
fleets of boats lay at harbor   
filled with silks and fine gems 
this was no forsaken
town on a lake 
this was the center of
all trade in the north 
i would   
see those days return 
i would relight the great
forges of the dwarves   
and send wealth and riches   
flowing once more from
the halls of erebor 
death 
that is what you will   
bring upon us 
dragon fire and ruin 
if you waken that beast   
it will destroy us all 
you can listen to this naysayer   
but i promise you this 
if we succeed   
all will share in the
wealth of the mountain 
you will have enough gold
to rebuild esgaroth   
10 times over 
all of you 
listen to me 
you must listen 
have you forgotten
what happened to dale 
have you forgotten those   
who died in the firestorm  
and for what purpose 
the blind ambition of
a mountain king   
so riven by greed  he could not   
see beyond his own desire 
now  now 
we must not  any of us   
be too quick to lay blame 
let us   
not forget that it was   
girion  lord of dale   
your ancestor   
who failed to kill the beast 
it s true  sire 
we all know the story 
arrow after arrow  he shot 
each one missing its mark 
you have no right 
no right to enter that mountain 
i have the only right 
i speak to the master   
of the men of the lake 
will you see the
prophecy fulfilled 
will you   
share in the great
wealth of our people 
what say you 
i say unto you   
welcome 
welcome 
and thrice   
welcome   
king under the mountain 
you do know we re
one short  where s bofur 
  if he s not here  we leave him behind 
  we ll have to 
if we re to find the door before
nightfall  we can risk no more delays 
not you 
we must travel at speed 
you will slow us down 
what are you talking about 
i m coming with you 
not now 
i m going to be there
when that door is opened 
when we first look upon the
halls of our fathers  thorin 
kili  stay here 
rest 
join us when you re healed 
i ll stay with the lad 
my duty lies with the wounded 
uncle 
we grew up on tales
of the mountain 
tales you told us 
you cannot take that away   
from him 
  fili 
i will carry him if i must 
one day you will be king
and you will understand 
i cannot risk the fate of this
quest for the sake of one dwarf 
not even my own kin 
fili  don t be a fool 
you belong with the company 
i belong with my brother 
by my beard  is that the time   ah 
go now with our goodwill   
and good wishes 
  and may your return bring good fortune   
  wait 
to all 
good bye 
out of the way

what is this place 
it was once the city of dale 
now it is a ruin 
the desolation of smaug 
the sun will soon reach midday 
we must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets 
this way 
wait  is this the overlook 
gandalf said to meet him here 
  on no account were we to   
  do you see him 
we have no time   
to wait upon the wizard 
we re on our own  come 
dol guldur 
the hill of sorcery 
it looks completely abandoned 
as it is meant to 
a spell of concealment   
lies over this place 
which means   
our enemy is not yet
ready to reveal himself 
he has not regained
his full strength 
radagast  i need you to carry
a message to the lady galadriel 
tell her we must force his hand 
what do you mean 
i m going in alone 
on no account come after me 
do i have your word 
yes  yes  yes 
wait  gandalf 
what if it s a trap  
turn around and do not come back 
it s undoubtedly a trap 
anything 
nothing 
if the map is true   
then the hidden door
lies directly above us 
up here 
you have keen eyes  master baggins 
this must be it 
the hidden door 
let all those who doubted us   
rue this day 
right  then  we have a key 
which means that somewhere   
there is a key hole 
 the last light of durin s day   
will shine upon   
the key hole  
nori 
we re losing the light  come on 
be quiet  i can t
hear when you re thumping 
i can t find it 
it s not here 
it s not here 
  break it down 
  aye 
come on

it s no good 
the door s sealed 
can t be opened by force 
there s a powerful magic on it 
no 
 the last light of durin s day   
will shine upon the key hole  
that is what it says 
what did we miss 
what did we miss 
balin 
we ve lost the light 
there s no more to be done 
we had but   
one chance 
come away  lads 
it s over 
  wait a minute 
  we re too late 
where are they going 
you can t give up now 
thorin

 stand by the gray stone   
when the thrush knocks  
the setting sun 
and  the last light of
durin s day will shine

chambers filled with golden light 
i remember 
 herein lies   
the seventh kingdom of   
durin s folk 
may the heart of the
mountain unite all   
dwarves in defense of this home  
the throne of the king 
ah 
and what s that above it

with as much luck
as you can muster 
oh  bilbo

a live dragon

i feel   
your air 
where are you 
where are you 
come  now   
don t be shy 
step into the light 
hmm 
there is something about you 
something you   
carry 
something made of gold 
but far more   
precious 
precious  precious 
there you are   
thief in the   
shadows 
i did not come to steal from you   
o smaug   
the unassessably wealthy 
i merely wanted   
to gaze upon your magnificence 
to see   
if you really were as great
as the old tales say 
i did not believe them 
and do you now  
truly   
the tales and songs   
fall utterly short
of your enormity   
o smaug the stupendous 
do you think flattery
will keep you alive 
no  no 
no  indeed 
you seem familiar with my name   
but i don t remember
smelling your kind before 
who are you   
and where do you come from   
may i ask 
i come from under the hill 
underhill 
and under hills   
and over hills my path has led 
and    and   
through the air 
i am he who walks unseen 
impressive 
what else do you claim to be 
i am   
luck wearer 
riddle maker 
lovely titles 
go on 
barrel rider 
barrels  now that is interesting 
and what about   
your little dwarf friends 
where are they hiding 
dwarves 
no 
no  no  no dwarves here 
you ve got that all wrong 
oh  i don t think so  barrel rider 
they sent you in here   
to do their dirty
work while they   
skulk about outside 
truly   
you are mistaken   
o smaug  chiefest and
greatest of calamities 
you have nice manners   
for a thief and   
a liar 
i know the smell and
taste of dwarf 
no one better 
it is the gold 
they are drawn   
to treasure like   
flies to dead flesh 
did you think i did not know   
this day would come  
that a pack of   
canting dwarves   
would come crawling back   
to the mountain  
was that an earthquake 
that  my lad   
was a dragon 
da 
it s coming from the mountain 
you should leave us 
take your children 
get out of here 
and go where 
there is nowhere to go 
are we going to die  da 
no  darling 
the dragon 
it s going to kill us 
not if i kill it first 
the king under the
mountain is dead 
i took his throne 
i ate his   
people like a wolf among sheep 
i kill where   
i wish  when   
i wish 
my armor is iron 
no blade can pierce me 
all right 
a black arrow 
why did you never tell me 
because you did not need to know 
listen to me carefully 
i need you to distract the guards 
once i m at the top of the tower 
i ll set the arrow to the bow 
there he is 
bard 
  after him 
  quickly  down there  go 
stop him 
stop him 
stop 
bain  bain 
keep it safe  don t let anyone
find it  i ll deal with them 
  i m not leaving you 
  now go 
braga 
you re under arrest 
  on what charge 
  any charge the master chooses 
where s he gone 
what about bilbo 
give him more time 
time to do what  to be killed 
you re afraid 
yes  i m afraid 
i fear for you 
a sickness lies upon
that treasure hoard 
a sickness which drove
your grandfather mad 
i am not my grandfather 
you re not yourself 
the thorin i know would not
hesitate to go in there   
i will not risk this
quest for the life of one burglar 
bilbo 
his name is bilbo 
it s oakenshield   
that filthy dwarvish usurper 
he sent you in here   
for the arkenstone  didn t he 
no  no   
no  i don t know what
you re talking about 
don t bother denying it 
i guessed his foul
purpose some time ago 
but it matters not 
oakenshield s quest will fail 
the darkness is coming 
it will spread to every
corner of the land 
you are being used  thief   
in the shadows  you were only   
ever a means to an end 
the coward   
oakenshield has weighed   
the value of your life   
and found it worth nothing 
no 
no 
no  you re lying 
what did he promise you 
a share of the treasure 
as if it was his   
to give 
i will not part with   
a single coin 
not one piece of it 
my teeth   
are swords 
my claws are spears 
my wings   
are a hurricane 
so it is true 
the black arrow found its mark 
what did you say 
i was just saying your reputation
precedes you  o smaug   
the tyrannical 
truly 
you have no equal on this earth 
i am   
almost tempted to let you take it 
if only to see oakenshield   
suffer 
watch it   
destroy him 
watch it corrupt his heart   
and drive him mad 
but i think not 
i think our little game ends here 
so tell me   
thief   
how do you choose to die 
nah 
da  is that you  da 
  aah 
  stay down 
get down 
you killed them all 
there are others 
tauriel 
come 
we re losing him 
tauriel 
athelas 
athelas 
what are you doing 
i m going to save him 
  you re alive 
  not for much longer 
did you find the arkenstone 
the arkenstone 
the dragon s coming

hold him down 
unh  tilda 
shh  shh  shh 
we ve given him the slip 
no 
he s too cunning for that 
so where to now 
the western guardroom 
there may be a way out 
it s too high  there s no chance   
  that way 
  it s our only chance 
we have to try 
come on 
i ve heard tell of the
wonders of elvish medicine 
that was a privilege to witness 
tauriel 
lie still 
you cannot be her 
she is far away 
she is far   
far away from me 
she walks   
in starlight in another world 
it was just a dream 
do you think she could ve loved me 
stay close 
that s it  then 
there s no way out 
the last of our kin 
they must have come here   
hoping   
beyond hope 
we could try to reach the mines 
we might last a few days 
no 
i will not die like this 
cowering 
clawing for breath 
we make for the forges 
he ll see us  sure as death 
not if we split up 
thorin   
we ll never make it 
some of us might 
lead him to the forges 
we kill the dragon 
if this is to end in fire   
then we will all burn together 
this way 
flee 
flee 
run for your lives 
there is   
nowhere to hide 
behind you 
worm 
come on 
run

come on 
now 
lead him to the
gallery of the kings 
keep going  bilbo 
run 
you think you   
can deceive me  barrel rider 
you have come from lake town 
this is some   
sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy dwarves   
and those miserable
tub trading lakemen 
those sniveling cowards   
with their long bows   
and black arrows 
perhaps it is time   
i paid them a visit 
oh  no 
this isn t their fault 
wait 
you cannot go to lake town 
you care about them   
you 
good 
then you can   
watch them die 
here 
you witless worm 
you 
i am taking back what you stole 
you   
will take nothing   
from me   
dwarf 
i laid low your warriors   
of old 
i instilled terror in   
the hearts of men 
i am   
king under   
the mountain 
this is not your kingdom 
these are dwarf lands 
this is dwarf gold 
and we will   
have our revenge 
revenge  
revenge  
i will show you revenge 
listen to me
