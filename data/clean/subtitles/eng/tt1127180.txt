lets see what the fates have in store
clay you know freud
said destiny was not
an act of fate but
rather something created
by our subconscious to
control our conscious choices
thats true
but we cannot attempt to understand
the world by intellect alone
clay oh carl jung
yes from his treatise
psychological types
christine so
jung new agers favorite psychologist
because he wasnt afraid to
bring god into the equation

well anyone can see
shes missing a button
so what
clay it was really strange
the old woman today she

ominous orchestral music

wind blowing
soft cracking

wait wait wait
did you see something
a dark spirit has come upon you

did you blaspheme the dead
while visiting a graveyard
no
did you play with a ouija board
or consort with those who
practice the black arts
all right take it easy man
come on
wait clay clay clay
no no i didnt
perhaps someone has cursed you
unnerving orchestral music
then how did he know all that
know what that you lost a button
and by the way he didnt
really know that much
he makes a couple of good guesses
then he stirs you up
and then he leaves you
with all these questions
and conveniently his business card
chuckles
come on chris hes a scam artist
but he didnt want the money
he tried to give it back remember
well he sort of tried
but in the end he took it didnt he

you deserve everything
that is coming to you
yelling in foreign language
people chattering
i believe what plagues you is the lamia
lamia thats the
word the old woman used
the black goat
only summoned by gypsies
for their darkest deeds
for the first three days
the lamia appears as a nasty spirit
that torments its victim
after that it reveals itself
to be a taker of souls
and it comes for the owner
of the accursed object
accursed object
what object
something taken from the
victim cursed and given back
this
what if i just burn it
im afraid no matter what
condition the button is in
you would still be the owner
the lamia would still come to take you
take me where
ominous orchestral music
then how do i get rid of this
you could attempt to appease the spirit
the simplest way would
be a blood offering
a small creature could be
sacrificed a chicken perhaps
no way
look im a vegetarian
i volunteer at the puppy
shelter for christs sake
i dont go around killing animals
you will be surprised
what youll be willing to do
when the lamia comes for you
this will show you how

group laughs
its good its good
in fact christine just got me
a 1929 standing liberty
quarter at her bank
really
isnt that crazy
yeah its rare
oh i just think the job
of a bank teller must be so difficult
with all that counting and repetition
must get very tedious
yes youre right but im not a teller
oh
yeah mom i told you
christines a loan officer
ah
she handles all the loans
for small businesses
and homes for her bank
and shes up for this big promotion so
right chris
if i could close this one
account that im working on
it would really help
well that must be
a very important loan
its the biggest that my
branch has ever handled
and how did that come to you
well i was reading
the wall street journal
and came across this
medical supply company
that was looking to expand
but didnt have the liquidity
so i met with their cfo
and presented a formula
for restructuring some
of their longterm debt
sounds like youve got a
lot going for you christine
well your mother must
be very proud of you
i suppose
uh i dont see much of my mother
why is that
wow mom thats its kind of personal
im speaking to christine
sighs
uh well ever since my dad died
um she doesnt talk much
she just uh
stays on the farm and
keeps to herself because
because
because her husband died mom
and she just wants to be by herself
why dont
because my mothers an alcoholic
oh
im sorry
its certainly nothing to be ashamed of
have to say i find your
honesty very refreshing
my father had a drinking problem
and i was always too ashamed to admit it
youve got backbone
unlike that last girl he brought by
what was her name
alice
we dont have to
alicia
alicia
oh
she was dreadful christine
she was illmannered no ambition at all
well they met on the internet

misconception to think
that people of good breeding
and success should be able
to meet potential life partners
in a realistic situation
highpitched hum
mumbling

youre so full of shit
these are elusive and powerful
forces we are dealing with

we must dissuade it from
taking your soul and soon
i know someone who can help us
and im supposed to trust you
tomorrow is the third day
after that the lamia will come for you
we cant let that happen
but you must understand
the woman who can help us must
put herself at great risk
she will not do that for free
what do you need from me
10000 cash by tomorrow
mr jacks

this is kind of awkward for me
and i know its not official yet
but i was wondering if
i could get an advance

members is really sick
theyre not gonna die
but they could
christine christine
theres a problem
the mcpherson deal was
canceled last night

that we had this big loan pending
i find out that they just made their deal
over at first national
now i gotta call in to
see what exactly happened

too good for you or for me
so this assistant manager
promotion has been delayed

and
tetiechko please

but to summon it i will need your help
can you be strong

my late husband
sandor was also medium
he chose this site to build a house upon
because he sensed certain
forces at work here
in this place there is a particular
speaking in foreign language
a particular confluence of
forces which allows a doorway
to be opened through which we may pass
speaking in foreign language
and through which others
may pass into our world
ominous orchestral music
shaun please be seated

loud tinkling
soft tinkling
laughing
shrieks
loud crash

it is the spirit of some
unsettled soul from years ago
sometimes the unsettled
ones linger by the door
there are others here as well
screeches

begone foolish spirits
begone
shouting in foreign language
screams
loud hum

suspenseful orchestral music
door rattling
loud thud

groaning
call an ambulance

rham no
oh my gosh
somber orchestral music
its so sad
yes
strange how things work out
she waited 40 years for another chance
to overcome the lamia
and finally on the last
night of her life she did
no im afraid you misunderstand
the lamia cannot be banished by a medium
this is our lesson tonight
im sorry
but i saw her get rid
of the thing
no
you saw her drive it from a seance
that is all
it will be back
the goat was never slaughtered
when this night is through
the lamia will come for the
owner of the accursed object
unless of course you
are no longer the owner
do you have the button
make a gift of it and
youve given the curse away
why didnt you tell me this before
because the lamia will tear the soul
out of whoever you give that to
theyll burn in hell for eternity
and i would have sent them there
i would be your accomplice
whatever you decide
you have till morning
ominous orchestral music
is it over
its over

suspenseful orchestral music
well
is it possible
there are gypsy blessings
bestowed upon the dead
they give gifts to their departed
to curry favor with the deceaseds soul
for truly the soul never dies
yes
i do believe you can give the curse
to someone who has passed on
but you must make a formal gift
of the accursed object to the deceased

im sorry im calling so
early but last night
i found some troubling information
about our friend stu rubin
apparently he stole your
file on the mcpherson loan
and then tried to broker his
own deal at first national
i guess he thought we wouldnt find out
and we wouldnt have either
except that an hour ago
he came by my house and tried
to pin the whole thing on you
after i confronted him
about a few inconsistencies in his story
he broke down crying and well
we wont be seeing him around anymore
so i just wanted you to know
that come monday morning
that assistant managers
position will be waiting for you
