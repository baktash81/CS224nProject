so  you wish to know
something of your destiny 
  yes 
  very good 
let s see what the fates have in store 
 clay  you know  freud
said destiny was not
an act of fate  but
rather something created
by our subconscious to
control our conscious choices 
that s true 
but we cannot attempt to understand
the world by intellect alone 
 clay  oh  carl jung 
yes  from his treatise
psychological types 
 christine  so

did you play with a ouija board
or consort with those who
practice the black arts 
all right  take it easy  man 
come on 
  wait  clay  clay  clay 
no  no  i didn t 
perhaps someone has cursed you 
 unnerving orchestral music 
then how did he know all that 
know what  that you lost a button 
and by the way  he didn t
really know that much 
he makes a couple of good guesses 
then he stirs you up 
and then he leaves you
with all these questions
and  conveniently  his business card 
 chuckles 
come on  chris  he s a scam artist 
but he didn t want the money 
he tried to give it back  remember 
well  he sort of tried 
but in the end  he took it  didn t he

i believe what plagues you is the lamia 
lamia  that s the
word the old woman used 
the black goat 
only summoned by gypsies
for their darkest deeds 
for the first three days 
the lamia appears as a nasty spirit
that torments its victim 
after that  it reveals itself
to be a taker of souls 
and it comes for the owner
of the accursed object 
accursed object 
what object 
something taken from the
victim  cursed and given back 
this 
what if i just burn it 
i m afraid no matter what
condition the button is in 
you would still be the owner 
the lamia would still come to take you 
take me where 
 ominous orchestral music 
then how do i get rid of this 
you could attempt to appease the spirit 
the simplest way would
be a blood offering 
a small creature could be
sacrificed  a chicken perhaps 
no way 
look  i m a vegetarian 
i volunteer at the puppy
shelter  for christ s sake 
i don t go around killing animals 
you will be surprised
what you ll be willing to do
when the lamia comes for you

if i could close this one
account that i m working on 
it would really help 
well  that must be
a very important loan 
it s the biggest that my
branch has ever handled 
and how did that come to you 
well  i was reading
the wall street journal
and came across this
medical supply company
that was looking to expand 
but didn t have the liquidity 
so i met with their cfo
and presented a formula
for restructuring some
of their long term debt 
sounds like you ve got a
lot going for you  christine 
well  your mother must
be very proud of you 
i suppose 
uh  i don t see much of my mother 
why is that 
wow  mom  that s  it s kind of personal 
i m speaking to christine 
 sighs 
uh  well  ever since my dad died 
um  she doesn t talk much 
she just  uh 
stays on the farm and
keeps to herself because   
because 
because her husband died  mom 
and she just wants to be by herself 
why don t  
because my mother s an alcoholic 
oh 
i m sorry 
it s certainly nothing to be ashamed of 
have to say  i find your
honesty very refreshing 
my father had a drinking problem 
and i was always too ashamed to admit it 
you ve got backbone 
unlike that last girl he brought by 
what was her name 
  alice 
  we don t have to  
alicia 
  alicia 
  oh 
she was dreadful  christine 
she was ill mannered  no ambition at all 
well  they met on the internet 
there you go 
  oh  what is that 
 they met on the internet  
  really 
  what does that mean 
am i being too hard on him 
  no  not at all 
  there you go

  well  you need to do that

  very nice 
  even the pictures are
false half the time

  oh  it s true 
i don t think it s a
misconception to think
that people of good breeding
and success should be able
to meet potential life partners
in a realistic situation 
 high pitched hum 
 mumbling

mom  she needs my help 
let her go 
 loud crash 
  wait 
what s the matter 
 groans 
 loud crash 
look  i did what you said 
i killed that little kitty 
you re so full of shit 
these are elusive and powerful
forces we are dealing with 
there are no guarantees 
we must speak directly
to this dark spirit 
we must dissuade it from
taking your soul  and soon 
i know someone who can help us 
and i m supposed to trust you 
tomorrow is the third day 
after that  the lamia will come for you 
we can t let that happen 
but you must understand 
the woman who can help us must
put herself at great risk 
she will not do that for free 
what do you need from me 
 10 000  cash  by tomorrow 
mr  jacks 
yeah 
this is kind of awkward for me 
and i know it s not official yet 
but i was wondering if
i could get an advance

members is really sick 
they re not gonna die 
but they could

right after i informed the regional office
that we had this big loan pending 
i find out that they just made their deal
over at first national 
now  i gotta call in to

but to summon it  i will need your help 
can you be strong 
i ll try 
my late husband 
sandor  was also medium 
he chose this site to build a house upon
because he sensed certain
forces at work here 
in this place  there is a particular
 speaking in foreign language  
a particular confluence of
forces which allows a doorway
to be opened through which we may pass 
 speaking in foreign language 
and through which others
may pass into our world

the lamia into the goat 
milos  that s when you strike 
si  tetiechko 
 speaking in foreign language 
i understand 
we all must be receptive 
 speaking in foreign language 
what am i supposed to do 
you must allow the darkness in 
you must invite the dead to
co mingle with your spirit 
i m scared 
yes 
now repeat these words  i
welcome the dead into my soul 
 speaking in foreign language 
i welcome the dead into my soul 
you must believe it

strange how things work out 
she waited 40 years for another chance
to overcome the lamia 
and finally  on the last
night of her life  she did 
no  i m afraid you misunderstand 
the lamia cannot be banished by a medium 
this is our lesson tonight 
i m sorry 
but i saw her get rid
of the thing 
  no 
you saw her drive it from a seance 
that is all 
it will be back 
the goat was never slaughtered 
when this night is through 
the lamia will come for the
owner of the accursed object 
unless  of course  you
are no longer the owner 
do you have the button 
make a gift of it and
you ve given the curse away 
why didn t you tell me this before 
because the lamia will tear the soul
out of whoever you give that to 
they ll burn in hell for eternity 
and i would have sent them there 
i would be your accomplice 
whatever you decide 
you have till morning 
 ominous orchestral music

who does deserve this 
 suspenseful orchestral music 
well 
is it possible 
there are gypsy blessings
bestowed upon the dead 
they give gifts to their departed
to curry favor with the deceased s soul 
for  truly  the soul never dies 
yes 
i do believe you can give the curse
to someone who has passed on 
but you must make a formal gift
of the accursed object to the deceased 
oh  i ll do better than that

i m sorry i m calling so
early  but last night 
i found some troubling information
about our friend stu rubin 
apparently  he stole your
file on the mcpherson loan
and then tried to broker his
own deal at first national 
i guess he thought we wouldn t find out 
and we wouldn t have  either 
except that an hour ago 
he came by my house and tried
to pin the whole thing on you 
after i confronted him
about a few inconsistencies in his story 
he broke down crying and  well 
we won t be seeing him around anymore 
so i just wanted you to know
that  come monday morning 
that assistant manager s
position will be waiting for you
