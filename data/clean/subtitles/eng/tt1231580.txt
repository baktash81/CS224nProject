chipette fan in the whole dang world 
ian hawke  that s who 
  yay  nice 
  oh  my gosh  oh  my gosh 
so when can we meet the chipmunks 
that s an excellent question 
and the excellent answer is 
i don t really represent
alvin and the chipmunks anymore 
  oh  no 
  what happened 
classic tale  sweet and innocent
when i met them  and they had nothing 
and then i work my butt off
to make them rock stars 
and they changed 
turned on me like bad cheese 
  no 
  that s terrible 
i know  i mean  i treated alvin
like he was my own son  you know 
and then he just goes and spits on me 
literally  he filled his chipmunk cheeks
with saliva and just had at it 
and don t even get me started
about simon 
but not theodore  right 
it s the cuddly ones
you have to watch out for 
but what are we talking about them for 
come on  they re over 
tired  novelty act 
chipmunks who can sing 
but girl chipmunks who can sing 
fasten your seatbelts 
so  i m on jay z s yacht  right 
and i say   jay  where s beyoncé  
and he says   she s holding a plate
full of cheese balls  turn around  
and guess what  she was 
p s   dave left me in charge 
staying up till 10 00 every night 
oh  yeah 
hey  girls  look what i can do 
you are theodore able 
  thank you 
  you re so cute 
i am so sorry

grab on  simon 
thanks 
you okay 
well  considering that you just
saved me from drowning in a toilet 
i m pretty good 
i ll be right back 
alvin  alvin  we re not going
to solve anything with violence 
  it s the fatty ratty 
  cut it out 
this rat has serious junk in the trunk 
  yeah  little fatty 
  stop it 
he jiggles when i poke him 
mommy 
simon  does this make my butt
look smaller 
theodore  your butt looks fine 
those guys are just jerks 
gentlemen 
you threatened to climb inside of him
and build a nest 
that was out of line 
i m not even sure
that s physically possible 
i should suspend all 3 of you 
please do 
instead  i have a better idea 
due to budget cutbacks 
we are in jeopardy of losing
our beloved music program 
  that s awful 
  i know 
but there is one small ray of hope 
every year the district sponsors
a music competition 
and the winner s school receives  25 000 
if we win  we can save our program 
and you want us to perform 
 cause i didn t think you were a fan 
why don t you sleep on it 
wait a minute  what is that  that s us 
  wait 
  i look skinny 
promise me that you won t say anything 
a principal has a certain image to uphold 
and if the faculty ever found out
about this  i could   
i just cannot believe that you re
actually sitting in my office 
i have all of your cds 
i even went to see you last year in denver 
that s where i got this 
it was my birthday 
and i was like   the chipmunks  
so what do you say 
will you represent our school 
honestly  suspension still sounds
pretty good to me 
come on  alvin  what do you say 
1 for all and 3 for 1 
well put  theodore  very well put 
count us in 
go  eagles 
eagles  where
