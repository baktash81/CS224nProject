with a beautiful baby girl
and throughout the land
everyone was happy
until the sun went down
and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment
that took hold each and every night
desperate they sought the help
of a fairy godmother
who had them lock the young princess
away in a tower
there to await the kiss
of the handsome prince charming
it was he who would chance
the perilous journey
through blistering cold
and scorching desert
traveling for many days and nights
risking life and limb
to reach the dragons keep
for he was the bravest
and most handsome
in all the land
and it was destiny that his kiss
would break the dreaded curse
he alone would climb to the highest room
of the tallest tower
to enter the princesss chambers
cross the room to her sleeping silhouette
pull back the gossamer curtains
to find her
what
princess fiona

the best thing that happened to you
what choice do i have
she loves that pretty boy
prince charming

warming up to prince charming

i beg to differ
i do it all the time
have fiona drink this and shell fall in love
with the first man she kisses
which will be charming
