with a beautiful baby girl 
and throughout the land 
everyone was happy   
until the sun went down
and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment
that took hold each and every night 
desperate  they sought the help
of a fairy godmother
who had them lock the young princess
away in a tower 
there to await the kiss   
of the handsome prince charming 
it was he who would chance
the perilous journey
through blistering cold
and scorching desert
traveling for many days and nights 
risking life and limb
to reach the dragon s keep 
for he was the bravest 
and most handsome   
in all the land 
and it was destiny that his kiss
would break the dreaded curse 
he alone would climb to the highest room
of the tallest tower
to enter the princess s chambers 
cross the room to her sleeping silhouette 
pull back the gossamer curtains
to find her   
what 
  princess    fiona

 i m an ogre  
i knew this would happen 
you should 
you started it 
i can hardly believe that  lillian 
he s the ogre  not me 
i think  harold  you re taking this
a little too personally 
this is fiona s choice 
but she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her 
i mean  you expect me to give
my blessings to this    thing 
fiona does 
and she ll never forgive you if you don t 
i don t want to lose
our daughter again  harold 
oh  you act as if love
is totally predictable 
don t you remember when
we were young 
we used to walk
down by the lily pond and   
  they were in bloom   
  our first kiss 
it s not the same 
i don t think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster 
oh  stop being such a drama king 
fine  pretend there s nothing wrong 
la  di  da  di  da 
isn t it all wonderful 
i d like to know
how it could get any worse 
hello  harold 
  what happened 
  nothing  dear 
just the old crusade wound
playing up a bit 
i ll just stretch it
out here for a while 
you better get in 
we need to talk 
actually  fairy godmother 
off to bed

and they tend to make me a bit drowsy 
so  how about    we make this
a quick visit  what

prince charming

scorching desert   
i climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower   
mommy can handle this 
he endures blistering winds
and scorching desert 
he climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower   
and what does he find 
some gender confused wolf
telling him that his princess
is already married 
it wasn t my fault 
he didn t get there in time 
stop the car 
harold
