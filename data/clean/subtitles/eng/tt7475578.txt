oh

before invading 
 sighs 
i warned him this morning that
if the french fulfil their obligations 
then we ll have to go in with them 
what did he say to that 
  he smiled at me 
  god 
even more disconcerting
than when he s shouting 
but the message was clear enough 
he s going to mobilise tomorrow 
 in german  nice dress she s wearing 
 officer 2  for the parade 
 laughter 
sir  have you chosen something yet 
  coffee  black

hello

the talks with the english
are over once and for all  he s fed up 
eventually  henderson just stayed silent 
wilson got up and left 
right to the airport and back to london 
and to prove that he means business 
this madman is now sending
a parade of tanks up wilhemstraße 
  straight to the british embassy 
  so

 announcer  in english  this is london 
in a moment 
you will hear the prime minister 
the right honourable neville chamberlain 
speaking from number 10 downing street 
his speech will be heard
all over the empire 
throughout the continent of america 
and in a large number
of foreign countries 
mr  chamberlain 
i want to say a few words to you 
men and women of britain and the empire 
how horrible and fantastic it is
that we should be digging trenches
and trying on gas masks here
because of a quarrel in a faraway country
  between people of whom we know nothing 
   scribbling 
both herr hitler and the czechs
have made their case
regarding the sudetenland passionately 
herr hitler has told me privately 
and last night repeated publicly 
that when this question is settled 
it is the end
of germany s territorial claims in europe 
 in german  damn fool 
 chamberlain  in english 
now  i ask you to await 
as calmly as you can 
the events of the next few days 
as long as war has not begun 
there is always hope
that it may be prevented 
and you know
that i am going to work for peace
to the last moment 
good night 
  and you re off air  prime minister 
  oh  good 
  well done  sir  no wobbles at all 
   chuckles 
uh  photograph 
there we are  as if i m reading 
very good  thank you so much 
  well navigated  sir 
  ah 
 chuckles  thank you 
do you know  i always think the trick is
to try to imagine i m just speaking
to one person
sitting at home in an armchair 
of course 
tonight  it was a little bit harder
because there was somebody else
lurking in the shadows 
herr hitler 
 typing 
radio address of the british
prime minister neville chamberlain
 sighs 
 in german  you re taking it
to the chancellery yourself 
yes  i m very curious
to see how hitler will reply 
  what about after 
  after 
after 
  after  i have an appointment in mitte 
  i see  an  appointment  
yes 
how mysterious 
well  until next time  herr von hartmann

in the face of your fucking calmness 
do you not think there are things worth

 sniffs 
 muttering 
well 
 chamberlain  no

uh  legat  would you fetch my copy
of the times from my office 
  yes  sir 
  oh  i ve got one here 
  right  is it today s 
  yes 
 chamberlain  oh  good  now 
let s see what we ve got here 
  hitler s speech is page 17  sir 
  17  very good 
there we are  good  now  there s 
something has been niggling at me
since i read this 
 we never found
a single great power in europe
with a man at its head
who has as much understanding
for the distress of our people
as my great friend benito mussolini  
  see what i mean 
  yes 
i m not sure i do 
if herr hitler
is not going to listen to me 
 scribbling 
 maybe he ll listen to his great friend
benito mussolini 
now  legat  i want you to take this
to the cipher room
and have it telegraphed immediately
to jimmy drummond 
  our ambassador in rome 
  yes  prime minister 
hadn t you better tell the foreign
secretary you re writing to the italians 
oh  damn the foreign secretary 
 laughs 
oh  legat  forget you heard that 
 man 1  in german  scrub 
look at them  watch closely 
this is the place where the jew belongs 
 crowd jeering 
   horn beeps 
   man 1  keep scrubbing 
i said keep scrubbing 
 laughter 
into the cracks  as well 
keep scrubbing  i said keep scrubbing 
 man 2  you missed a spot 
look at him  this jewish pig 
how his presence ruined the very ground 
 woman sings in german 
  your soft breath gives solace   
the cracks as well 
keep scrubbing  i said keep scrubbing 
  in your arms  
  for hours walking barefoot  
  over the soft moss  
  you re silently dreaming  
  of strange star signs  
  the golden locks  
  kindled by the moon  
  i see the longing  
  but you can t stay   
  sorry 
  thought you d got lost 
what 
very strange to meet you here 
lieutenant colonel 
  i ve never seen you out of uniform 
  one second 
andi  three schnapps 
 andi  three schnapps  coming right up 
go ahead 
everyone was there 
all the top ranking defence generals 
and they all confirmed again
that there is strong opposition
to a war with the czechs 
this is the moment we ve been waiting for 
at two o clock tomorrow 
when hitler gives the order to invade 
the wehrmacht will step in 
  and the three of us are the key 
  what exactly does that mean 
we go to the chancellery 
we make sure
that all important entry points are clear 
then we give the signal to step in 
and hitler will be arrested 
you believe that the wehrmacht
will take action against him 
war with the czechs  that s 
that means war with britain and france 
that s crazy 
it s the last thing the generals want 
right  hans 
but still  i don t trust the generals 
they re not opposed to him 
they re just opposed to war
because they re scared they ll lose it 
is this really the only plan 
 hans  it s the only plan we have  erich 
 erich  it all sounds
so incredibly fragile 
have you ever wondered if we re wrong 
what if we re mistaken 
what if he s right 
and he s telling the truth
that he just wants to take back
the territories that belong to germany 
  and he ll stop there 
  then leave  erich 
he s a small  vulgar man 
hitler is like a thug 
he only knows his own personal truth 
he ll keep taking more and more 
  more people will get hurt 
  how do you know 
  he ll never stop 
  it s not the time to argue 
  tomorrow  tomorrow is the day   
   andi  three schnapps 
 woman singing softly in german 
are you with us  erich 
let s assume
hitler gets arrested tomorrow 
what happens then 
we shoot the bastard 
if he doesn t surrender 
tomorrow at two o clock  we will hear
that mobilisation is beginning 
that will be our cue 
friends  history is watching us 
sometime tomorrow night 
this whole nightmare will be over 
    i see the longing   
   sighs 
  but you can t stay  
  come dance through the blue night  
  with me one more time  
   sighs heavily 
   machinery clanking 
   machinery whirring 
   voices echoing 
   winter  what  you want to arrest him 
   paul  that s the plan  yeah 
  you think that could work 
  yes 
this wehrmacht will turn against the boss 
never  mark my word 
i was married to a general 
  your husband was a disloyal arsehole 
  yes  to me  maybe  but never to hitler 
when he mobilises tomorrow 
we will stop him 
  you want him to mobilise 
  yes  damn it 
 whispers  if he doesn t go to war 
you can t stop him 
but  paul  that means you need this war 
that s totally perverse 
of course that s perverse  helen 
without a crime  there can be no arrest 
what 
i m considering if i should trust you 
mm hm 
  you ve already trusted me 
  this is something different 
what is it 
foreign office
political department
 exhales 
what s this 
i got it from the foreign office 
i took it today 
what s this 
this is his true plan for europe 
protocol of the meeting in the chancellery
on november 5  1937
 sighs 
they ll arrest you for this 
i m aware 
 paul sighs 
  this is appalling 
  what are you going to do with it 
what are you going to do with it 
 knocking at door 
come in 
letting you know i ll be upstairs  sir 
if you need me 
righto  oh  you re on tonight  are you 
yes  sir  i m here till the morning 
oh  good  any reply from rome 
not yet  sir 
but  you know  it wasn t built in a day 
hah   chuckles 
far as i can see 
they haven t finished it yet   chuckles 
are you an oxford man 
yes  prime minister 
aah  come on in  close the door a minute 
terribly draughty  this place 
  what did you read at oxford 
  german 
did they teach you
to write english as well 
 laughs  well  they did their best 
i was more of a talker than a writer 
though  sir  debating was my thing 
  debating 
  yes  sir 
well  you ve come to the right place 
it s all anybody seems to do here
is to debate 
listen  i ve got something
i m going to ask you to do 
it s a little bit impertinent  but this is
my speech for tomorrow to the house 
but i    i feel somehow it doesn t flow 
and maybe    maybe an oxford man 
who  who debates and  and reads german 
might be able to improve it a little 
  would you mind 
  of course  prime minister 
thank you so much 
  very good  good night 
  good night  sir 
 murmur of conversation 
  i m sorry 
  how are you 
  ah  this looks promising 
  george   
  make sure you got your camera 
  ready 
 officer  all right  okay 
  yes  sir 
  just keep an eye on them 
nothing from rome  prime minister 
oh  huh 
still early 
just have to be patient and wait 
 sighs 
do you know 
i d gladly stand against that wall
and be shot if it prevented war 
come here 
i wish you wouldn t say things like that 
  hmm 
  at least not before lunch 
right 
of course  you were too young
to serve in the great war  legat 
 sighs 
and i was too old 
somehow  that made things worse 
it is absolute agony to 
see such suffering and 
feel so powerless 
oh  right 
now every time i 
pass a war memorial or 
visit one of those
vast cemeteries in france 
where so many of my friends lie buried 
i vow that if i find myself
in the position
where i could prevent
such a catastrophe from happening again 
i shall do anything 
sacrifice anything 
to maintain the peace 
this is sacred to me 
i understand 
ah  it s not that
we re militarily unprepared for war 
that can be remedied  is being remedied 
it s    it is rather that i  i fear for
the spiritual wellbeing of our people
if they don t see their leaders
doing everything  absolutely everything 
to prevent another conflict 
 cause of one thing  i m certain 
if it comes 
the next war
will be infinitely worse than the last 
and they will need even greater fortitude
to survive it 
  neville 
  no 
oh  it s all right  it s all right 
 kisses  come on  let s go in 
this is joan  mr  legat 
she s our fastest 
joan  stop what you re doing now 
mr  legat needs you

 chuckles

syers has the line to rome 
so i want you to sit here

 and keep the line open
and listen out for news 
  do you think you can manage that 
  of course  sir 
what exactly am i listening for 
to see whether mussolini s intervened 
the pm needs to know

   door opens

 crackling on line 
  hello 
   man  this is the ambassador 
mr  henderson  this is hugh legat 
the prime minister s private secretary 
i just returned from herr hitler 
where s the pm 
 chamberlain  for his majesty s
government 
there were three alternative courses
that might have been adopted 
either we could have threatened
to go to war with germany
if it attacked czechoslovakia 
or we could have stood aside
and allowed matters to take their course 
or finally  we could attempt
a peaceful settlement by way of mediation 
 mps  hear  hear 
i know very well
that i have opened myself to criticism
  on the grounds that i was detracting 
  it s a message from berlin 
 chamberlain   from the dignity
of a british prime minister 
and to disappointment
and perhaps even resentment 
  murmuring 
 if i failed to deliver
a satisfactory agreement 
  ahem 
   mps whispering and muttering 
 sighs 
 exhales heavily 
 mps murmuring 
i am 
able to report to the house
that i have just received news from berlin
that herr hitler
has postponed mobilisation 
 cheering 
guten tag 
furthermore 
  he has invited me 
   man  very well done  prime minister 
 along with signor mussolini
and the prime minister of france 
monsieur daladier 
  to meet him in munich tomorrow 
   knocking at door 
 to resolve the sudetenland issue 
 mps cheering 
 in german  gentlemen 
  is it starting 
   sighs 
mussolini talked hitler into a conference
with chamberlain and daladier 
tomorrow in munich 
they re going to sacrifice the sudetenland
to prevent war 
  damn it 
  they re doing exactly what he wants 
  will the wehrmacht move against him 
  we can forget about that 
  not a chance 
  so this is it 
  god damn it 
  honestly  please 
pardon me 
what do the gentlemen plan on doing 
it s as good as decided 
a conference like this is a formality 
you need to find a way
to meet chamberlain 
you have to prevent this agreement
from being made 
 chuckles 
thank god you can still laugh 
show him the proof 
  what proof 
  that hitler is bent on a war of conquest 
i am in possession of a document 
what kind of document 
 paul  trust me  please 
  paul 
  can i just 
just a moment 
hugh legat
is one of chamberlain s secretaries 
can you arrange for him to come to munich 
that he s part of the english delegation 
possibly  yes 
  will he be expecting   
  no 
but he will help us 
all right 
right  i ll do what i can 
gentlemen 
 door closes 
and can you get paul into the conference 
i ll try and add you as an interpreter 
i have to get back 
what s happening here 
do you think
you can smuggle illegal documents
into an international conference
and have a secret meeting
with the british prime minister 
right under the führer s nose 
  yes 
   laughs 
oh  paul 
then you should have this with you 
ever used one 
  as children  we used to shoot rabbits 
   both laugh 
this is different 
the principle s the same  right 
thanks 
 in english  sir alexander 
i got a message you wanted to see me 
 cadogan  ah  legat  yes 
close the door 
what s this about  sir 
 cadogan  this is colonel menzies
from mi6 
  colonel 
  good evening 
i believe the name paul von hartmann
is known to you 
 cadogan  legat 
yes 
yes  sir  we were at oxford together 
when did you last see him 
uh  the summer of  32 
i visited him in munich 
all roads lead to munich 
  any contact since 
  no 
  why not 
  we had a disagreement 
  what about 
  politics 
and you haven t communicated since 
no  sir 
we re sorry about the questions  legat 
but we need to understand
what sort of relationship you have 
or had  with this particular german 
it seems your friend is part of
the secret opposition to hitler 
his position inside the foreign ministry
gives him access to classified material 
material he s willing to share with us 
or  more specifically  with you 
how do you feel about that 
surprised 
 cadogan  but 
are you willing to take matters further 
i don t understand 
he has a document in his possession 
and we d very much like to know
what it is 
we d like you to go to munich tomorrow 
meet with von hartmann 
and get the document 
i beg your pardon 
it s not without risk 
technically  it ll be
an act of espionage on foreign soil 
this kind of thing  sir  i   
  i m not really   
  no one is at first  but you ll do fine 
duty calls  legat 
  i m not sure how cleverly will feel   
   cadogan  leave cleverly to us 
absolutely  we know oscar 
and the pm doesn t need to know 
well 
good luck  legat

the führer began by explaining
that the question is one of space 
 men singing in german 
the german race comprises over 85 million 
and this constitutes a more tightly packed
racial community than any other country 
 girl speaking german 
the only remedy lies
in the acquisition of living space 
and this will only be solved
by means of force

no  no  no  no  come on in  legat 
just having my blood pressure checked 
 groans 
fortunately  it looks
as if i ll live another day 
  good night 
  good night  joseph  thank you 
 sighs 
so what is it that can t wait  hm 
we ve come into possession
of a significant document 
and who is  we  
i have come into possession of a document 
what is it 
the minutes of a meeting that hitler held
with his senior commanders last november 
mm hm 
a meeting in which he explicitly
commits himself to a war of conquest 
obviously  it s all in german 
but i believe it to be legitimate
and truthful 
and how did this document come to us 
a friend gave it to me
in strict confidence 
  friend 
  a german diplomat 
why does he wish us to have it 
i think he should explain that himself 
he s waiting outside 
  does sir horace know about this 
  no  sir 
nobody knows 
you re exceeding your authority 
young man 
 scoffs  i can t possibly meet
with a german diplomat 
i understand 
but he is risking his life to see you 
no 
this is  most improper 
i m aware  sir 
right 
three minutes  not a moment longer 
 door opens 
you ve got three minutes 
this is paul von hartmann
of the german foreign ministry 
  how do you do 
  thank you for seeing me 
i m not sure it s very wise 
for either of us 
take a seat  close the door  legat 
ah  ah 
you better come and join us  legat 
come on 
so  get on with it 
that document is proof
that hitler is lying
when he claims to have
no further territorial demands 
on the contrary 
he wants to expand the country 
and he will keep on expanding 
therefore  i beg you
not to sign the agreement tonight 
 laughing  what 
prime minister 
adolf hitler is a monster 
he is a madman 
you cannot give him what he wants 
he ll take more and more land 
more and more people will suffer 
that is the proof 
i applaud your courage  young man 
but i have to give you
a lesson in political reality 
the people of great britain will never
take up arms over a local border dispute 
  it s so much more than a local border   
  as for what hitler may do
or may not do in the future 
well  we shall have to wait and see 
  wait and see is not   
  my sole objective here
is to avert war in the immediate term 
so i can begin to build a lasting peace 
  there will be no lasting peace 
  but i have to try 
look  the worst thing i could do
is to walk away from this conference 
if you do  there are people waiting 
high up in the military 
a resistance  to bring him down 
  well  why haven t they done so already 
  they will if   
i can t rely on some resistance
you may believe exists in the german army 
i mean   laughs 
well  i 
think you should 
take this back to wherever it came from 
no 
keep it  study it 
that is the political reality 
now you re being impertinent 
and you are shaking hands with a man
who hates everything you stand for 
he is lying to you 
he will go further and further 
he will not stop  sir  he will never sto   
thank you for your time 
please don t sign the agreement 
get rid of this 
i have to say  legat 
i m extremely disappointed in you 
 door closes 
 sighs

 lena breathing 
 patients snoring 
 in english  what happened 
we split up 
after your trip to munich 
 sighs 
how did she end up here 
she was arrested at a protest in  35
and sent to moringen  the women s camp 
when they discovered she was jewish 
they were rough 
 scoffs 
they said she fell out of a window 
i m sure she did 
but not before
they carved a star of david onto her back 
i knew he was racist 
all the awful jewish stuff 
i thought it could be put to one side 
how 
but you can t put it aside 
if they are capable of that 
they are capable of anything 
lena knew that 
yes  she did 
may i 
shall we share 
 paul coughs 
what will you do 
carry on 
in a few hours  i have to present
a press summary to hitler 
i m told he s taken a shine to me 
 laughs 
maybe it s a chance
to really do something 
what do you 
  how 
  it would solve everything 
they d kill you
for even thinking about it 
i have a pistol 
i might get a moment alone with him 
stop it 
don t be stupid 
i ll take the document to london 
it will make a difference 
probably more talking  yes 
  yes  more talking 
  i have to fight 
you don t have to fight 
we don t choose the times we live in 
the only choice we have is how we respond 
  you don t have to fight  paul  we don t 
  i have to fight 
  we need to talk  we need to   
  i  have to fight 
  no  you don t  no

  your responsibility 
  or i may as well blow my brains out 
there are other ways of doing things 
talk  discussion   
  there s no other things  no

 sighs  hoping is waiting
for someone else to do it 
we d all be much better off without it

 birdsong 
 women laughing and speaking german 
i d miss you

regina palace hotel
  hello

asked if i might see him again
this morning before we fly back 
   hugh  asked who  sir 
  herr hitler 
did    did he agree 
 chuckles  couldn t really refuse 
must say  that was a remarkably rude young
man you brought to see me last night 
  i really am sorry about that  sir 
  ah  thank you 
  have you told anyone about it 
  no 
good  neither have i 
his arguments were naive 
but  they were not ineffective 
now  here we are 
listen  i d like you
to take this to wilson 
ask him to turn it
into a short statement of intent 
just from there to there 
sir  i don t follow 
well  on monday night 
hitler publicly declared his desire
for a permanent peace
between germany and great britain 
  yes 
  well  i d like his undertaking redrafted 
  in the form of a joint statement 
  a joint statement 
to which both he and i
can put our names this morning 
oh  get on with it  go on  get it done 
and get yourself a coffee 
you re half awake 
 we regard the agreement signed last night
as symbolic of the desire
of our two peoples
never to go to war
with one another again  
i hope the pm realises
this has no legal force whatsoever 
  the man s not a fool 
  what the hell s he playing at 
i ve no idea 
first i heard of it was half an hour ago 
  do you have it 
   wilson  yes 
  good 
  it may be a little long 
hmm 
 mumbles 
  what if he refuses to sign it 
   chamberlain  why should he 
these are all statements
he s made already 
 wilson  it doesn t mean
he s going to stick with them 
it s symbolic  horace 
last night s agreement
only settles a tiny dispute 
there will be others 
and i want him
to publicly commit himself to peace 
oh  legat  make sure
there s a car available at 11 00 
to the führerbau 
no  ah  you ve put my name before his 
it should be the other way around 
otherwise  good 
yes  i wanted to have
a private meeting with him 
man to man  no officials 
  he invited me to his apartment 
  what 
  no officials 
  not even you  horace 
oh  for god s sake  you can t go
and see hitler entirely on your own 
can and will 
gentlemen  we must rise
to the level of events 
 sighs

  prime minister 
  yes 
  i should accompany you to the meeting

i thought i had made this perfectly clear 
no officials 
not as an official  sir  as a translator 
no  i want him to feel
this is a personal meeting 
you need someone there to make sure
your words are accurately reported 
  i   
  remember what happened at berchtesgaden
  when he refused to give us a copy 
  no  that   
you can t trust schmidt to have your back 
i think a translator could be useful 
  i m the only one who speaks german 
  all right  all right  all right 
 sighs 
you can come  but be discreet 
keep out of his eyeline  and mine 
   reporters clamouring 
  mr  chamberlain

ins hotel begleiten 
 schmidt  in english 
i will accompany you back to your hotel 
thank you  herr hitler 
and may i add
that there was never a doubt
in my mind  sir 
as to the lengths to which you would go
to protect germany 
ich möchte dem hinzufügen 
ich habe nie daran gezweifelt 
zu was sie alles bereit wären 
um deutschland zu schützen 
 officer  in german 
the foreign press summary 
 in english  thank you  come along  legat 
 teacup clinking 
 knocking at door 
 man  in german 
the reichsführer is arriving 
please excuse me  my führer 
 hitler   the cheers for hitler
were mechanical and polite  
 for chamberlain  they were ecstatic  
 chuckles 
you  as an educated german 
what do you think  are they right 
i do not wish to be followed mechanically 
i gave germany back its dignity 
is it too much
to ask for a little gratitude 
 mechanical  
they re grateful
to this arsehole chamberlain 
am i the only one who realises
that we have a historic task ahead of us 
that this is the moment
for germany to fulfil its destiny 
speak  i want you to answer me 
why aren t they grateful 
the people don t want a war 
they re afraid 
the people don t know what they want 
they re children 
but you re right  they are afraid 
i am surrounded by cowardice 
yes  my führer 
i told you  i can read people 
you say yes 
but your eyes 
are saying no 
it s just you and i here 
so 
what are you thinking  von hartmann 
what do you 
want to say to me 
nothing 
 knock at door 
heil  my führer 
i m told you ve signed another agreement
with chamberlain 
don t take that so seriously 
that piece of paper is of no significance 
the problem lies here 
with the german people 
anything else 
 clicks heels 
thank you 
for 
this 
 shuddering 
thank you 
 in english  i hope you don t mind  they
asked me to share a ride to the airport 
i m glad to have a moment alone with you 
i haven t been
altogether straight with you

of a guardian angel 
what on earth are you talking about 
in london  you asked my surname

i think you know my uncle 
he s a colonel in the foreign office 
well  he asked me
to keep an eye on you out here 
thank goodness i did 
i took it from your room last night

the king has asked you
to go direct to buckingham palace
so their majesties
can thank you in person 
oh  god 
i shall have to speak to the cameras 
the world doesn t yet know
about our joint statement 
prime minister  i urge you
to treat the undertaking given by hitler
with the utmost caution 
  ah 
  the agreement on the sudetenland
  is one thing  but this other document   
  yes  i know  horace  look 
if there s one thing i ve learned
from my dealings with mr  hitler 
it s that you can t play poker
with a gangster
without any cards up your sleeve 
what if he breaks his word 
you ll look like a fool 
well  if he breaks his word  the world
will see him for who he truly is 
and it ll unite the allies 
might even bring the americans on board 
and if i m made to look a fool 
well  it s a small price to pay 
 wilson sighs 
horace  i can only play the game
with the cards i ve been dealt 
 sighs 
what do you think  legat 
do you think this will change the game 
i think there s a chance  prime minister 
so do i 
 cheering and applause 
 man  whoo 
 chamberlain  thank you so much 
how are you 
 wilson  look at that  legat 
you d think we won a war
rather than avoided one 
there are thousands of people
gathering on the mall 
welcome back  sir  congratulations 
 wilson  the king intends
to take him out onto the balcony 
the settlement
of the czechoslovakian problem 
which has been achieved 
 cheering 
 uh  is in my mind
merely a prelude to a larger settlement 
which  for all europe 
may bring peace 
 cheering and applause 
for this morning 
this morning i had another talk 
 thunder rumbling 
 with the german chancellor herr hitler 
here is the paper
which bears his name upon it
as well as mine 
  hello 
   sighs 
 pamela sighs 
  hello 
  hello 
where s arthur 
 sniffles  he s in the garden 
he ll be happy to see you 
 birdsong 
i m sorry for the way i left 
and  uh 
i wanted to say 
you were right 
i have felt disappointed 
and it s my fault  not yours 
but there are some things
i want to change 
 clock ticking 
i think i might resign from the service 
and do what 
when war comes  i need to be 
useful 
   sighs 
  yeah 
don t laugh 
but i think i might join the raf 
 chuckles 
what about the treaty 
i thought he just said that   
just a delay  the pm s given us a chance
of winning the damn thing when it happens 
it s quite some service
when you think about it 
but it s coming 
sooner or later 
one day soon  we will have to fight 
and we will have to win 
there must be something else
that you can do 
it s the   
  more talks  negotiations   
  there s no other way 
don t say that 
there s always hope 
yes 
and we d all be
much better off without it 
   running 
   arthur  daddy 
 pamela laughs 
 arthur giggles 
here  come here  up a squeak 
 sighs 
oh  i ve missed you 
 in german  i could have shot hitler 
 sniffles 
i was so close to him 
i could smell his breath 
i could feel the gun in my hand 
 sobs 
but my hand wouldn t move 
do you know why 
 sighs 
what would give me the right 
do you want to keep going 
what other choice do we have 
they ll hang you for that one day 
i know 
  withering hours  
  the gentle days keeping us warm  
  in your arms  flowers  
    turn to promises   
   lena  in english  i ll take it 
  that linger until dawn  
    you dream of summer   
  oh  you speak russian as well  right 
  of hearing bluebells chime  
  your golden locks  
    drenched in moonlight   
   ball goers cheering 
  sitting in silence  
  as we watch the birds fly by  
  come dance with me  
  into the dark blue night  
 cheering and laughter 
  come dance with me  
  into the dark blue night  
  the nightingale cries  
  in the meadows  
  as the dew drops from my eyes  
  you dream of summer  
  of hearing bluebells chime  
  your golden locks  
  drenched in moonlight  
  sitting in silence  
  as we watch the birds fly by  
  come dance with me  
  into the dark blue night  
  come dance with me  
  into the dark blue night  
  and every year  
  the free birds fly  
  into the distance  
  under auburn skies  
  fading to black  
  the forest sighs  
  waiting for spring  
  to bring them back  
  and every year  
  the free birds fly  
  into the distance  
  under auburn skies  
  fading to black  
  the forest sighs  
  waiting for spring  
  to bring them back  
  you dream of summer  
  of hearing bluebells chime  
  your golden locks
