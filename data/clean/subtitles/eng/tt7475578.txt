in a moment
you will hear the prime minister
the right honourable neville chamberlain
speaking from number 10 downing street
his speech will be heard
all over the empire
throughout the continent of america
and in a large number
of foreign countries
mr chamberlain
i want to say a few words to you
men and women of britain and the empire
how horrible and fantastic it is
that we should be digging trenches
and trying on gas masks here
because of a quarrel in a faraway country
between people of whom we know nothing
scribbling
both herr hitler and the czechs
have made their case
regarding the sudetenland passionately
herr hitler has told me privately
and last night repeated publicly
that when this question is settled
it is the end
of germanys territorial claims in europe
in german damn fool
chamberlain in english
now i ask you to await
as calmly as you can
the events of the next few days
as long as war has not begun
there is always hope
that it may be prevented
and you know
that i am going to work for peace
to the last moment
good night
and youre off air prime minister
oh good
well done sir no wobbles at all
chuckles
uh photograph
there we are as if im reading
very good thank you so much
well navigated sir
ah
chuckles thank you
do you know i always think the trick is
to try to imagine im just speaking
to one person
sitting at home in an armchair
of course
tonight it was a little bit harder
because there was somebody else
lurking in the shadows
herr hitler
typing
radio address of the british
prime minister neville chamberlain
sighs
in german youre taking it
to the chancellery yourself
yes im very curious
to see how hitler will reply
what about after
after
after
after i have an appointment in mitte

sniffs
muttering
well
chamberlain no
hes not changing his mind
you know we might
uh legat would you fetch my copy
of the times from my office
yes sir
oh ive got one here
right is it todays
yes
chamberlain oh good now
lets see what weve got here
hitlers speech is page 17 sir
17 very good
there we are good now theres
something has been niggling at me
since i read this
we never found
a single great power in europe
with a man at its head
who has as much understanding
for the distress of our people
as my great friend benito mussolini
see what i mean
yes
im not sure i do
if herr hitler
is not going to listen to me
scribbling
maybe hell listen to his great friend
benito mussolini
now legat i want you to take this
to the cipher room
and have it telegraphed immediately
to jimmy drummond
our ambassador in rome
yes prime minister
hadnt you better tell the foreign
secretary youre writing to the italians
oh damn the foreign secretary
laughs
oh legat forget you heard that
man 1 in german scrub
look at them watch closely
this is the place where the jew belongs
crowd jeering
horn beeps
man 1 keep scrubbing
i said keep scrubbing
laughter
into the cracks as well
keep scrubbing i said keep scrubbing
man 2 you missed a spot
look at him this jewish pig
how his presence ruined the very ground
woman sings in german
your soft breath gives solace
the cracks as well
keep scrubbing i said keep scrubbing
in your arms
for hours walking barefoot
over the soft moss
youre silently dreaming
of strange star signs
the golden locks
kindled by the moon
i see the longing
but you cant stay
sorry
thought youd got lost
what
very strange to meet you here
lieutenant colonel
ive never seen you out of uniform
one second
andi three schnapps
andi three schnapps coming right up
go ahead
everyone was there
all the topranking defence generals
and they all confirmed again
that there is strong opposition
to a war with the czechs
this is the moment weve been waiting for
at two oclock tomorrow
when hitler gives the order to invade
the wehrmacht will step in
and the three of us are the key
what exactly does that mean
we go to the chancellery
we make sure
that all important entry points are clear
then we give the signal to step in
and hitler will be arrested
you believe that the wehrmacht
will take action against him
war with the czechs thats
that means war with britain and france
thats crazy
its the last thing the generals want
right hans
but still i dont trust the generals
theyre not opposed to him
theyre just opposed to war
because theyre scared theyll lose it
is this really the only plan
hans its the only plan we have erich
erich it all sounds
so incredibly fragile
have you ever wondered if were wrong
what if were mistaken
what if hes right
and hes telling the truth
that he just wants to take back
the territories that belong to germany
and hell stop there
then leave erich
hes a small vulgar man
hitler is like a thug
he only knows his own personal truth
hell keep taking more and more
more people will get hurt
how do you know
hell never stop
its not the time to argue
tomorrow tomorrow is the day
andi three schnapps
woman singing softly in german
are you with us erich
lets assume
hitler gets arrested tomorrow
what happens then
we shoot the bastard
if he doesnt surrender
tomorrow at two oclock we will hear
that mobilisation is beginning
that will be our cue
friends history is watching us
sometime tomorrow night
this whole nightmare will be over
i see the longing
sighs
but you cant stay
come dance through the blue night
with me one more time
sighs heavily
machinery clanking
machinery whirring
voices echoing
winter what you want to arrest him
paul thats the plan yeah
you think that could work
yes
this wehrmacht will turn against the boss
never mark my word
i was married to a general
your husband was a disloyal arsehole
yes to me maybe but never to hitler
when he mobilises tomorrow
we will stop him
you want him to mobilise
yes damn it
whispers if he doesnt go to war
you cant stop him
but paul that means you need this war
thats totally perverse
of course thats perverse helen
without a crime there can be no arrest
what
im considering if i should trust you
mmhm
youve already trusted me
this is something different
what is it
foreign office
political department
exhales
whats this
i got it from the foreign office
i took it today

this is his true plan for europe
protocol of the meeting in the chancellery
on november 5 1937

paul sighs
this is appalling

what are you going to do with it
knocking at door

yes prime minister
aah come on in close the door a minute
terribly draughty this place
what did you read at oxford
german
did they teach you
to write english as well
laughs well they did their best
i was more of a talker than a writer
though sir debating was my thing
debating
yes sir
well youve come to the right place
its all anybody seems to do here
is to debate
listen ive got something
im going to ask you to do
its a little bit impertinent but this is
my speech for tomorrow to the house
but i i feel somehow it doesnt flow
and maybe maybe an oxford man
who who debates and and reads german
might be able to improve it a little
would you mind
of course prime minister
thank you so much
very good good night
good night sir
murmur of conversation
im sorry
how are you
ah this looks promising
george
make sure you got your camera
ready
officer all right okay
yes sir
just keep an eye on them
nothing from rome prime minister
oh huh
still early
just have to be patient and wait
sighs
do you know
id gladly stand against that wall
and be shot if it prevented war
come here
i wish you wouldnt say things like that
hmm
at least not before lunch
right
of course you were too young
to serve in the great war legat
sighs
and i was too old
somehow that made things worse
it is absolute agony to
see such suffering and
feel so powerless
oh right
now every time i
pass a war memorial or
visit one of those
vast cemeteries in france
where so many of my friends lie buried
i vow that if i find myself
in the position
where i could prevent
such a catastrophe from happening again
i shall do anything
sacrifice anything
to maintain the peace
this is sacred to me
i understand
ah its not that
were militarily unprepared for war
that can be remedied is being remedied
its it is rather that i i fear for
the spiritual wellbeing of our people
if they dont see their leaders
doing everything absolutely everything
to prevent another conflict
cause of one thing im certain
if it comes
the next war
will be infinitely worse than the last
and they will need even greater fortitude
to survive it
neville
no
oh its all right its all right
kisses come on lets go in

clock ticking
watch ticking
ticking grows louder
crackling on line
hello
man this is the ambassador
mr henderson this is hugh legat
the prime ministers private secretary
i just returned from herr hitler
wheres the pm
chamberlain for his majestys
government
there were three alternative courses
that might have been adopted
either we could have threatened
to go to war with germany
if it attacked czechoslovakia
or we could have stood aside
and allowed matters to take their course
or finally we could attempt
a peaceful settlement by way of mediation
mps hear hear
i know very well
that i have opened myself to criticism
on the grounds that i was detracting
its a message from berlin
chamberlain from the dignity
of a british prime minister
and to disappointment
and perhaps even resentment
murmuring
if i failed to deliver
a satisfactory agreement
ahem
mps whispering and muttering
sighs
exhales heavily
mps murmuring
i am
able to report to the house
that i have just received news from berlin
that herr hitler
has postponed mobilisation
cheering
guten tag
furthermore
he has invited me
man very well done prime minister
along with signor mussolini
and the prime minister of france
monsieur daladier
to meet him in munich tomorrow
knocking at door
to resolve the sudetenland issue
mps cheering
in german gentlemen
is it starting
sighs
mussolini talked hitler into a conference
with chamberlain and daladier
tomorrow in munich
theyre going to sacrifice the sudetenland
to prevent war
damn it
theyre doing exactly what he wants
will the wehrmacht move against him
we can forget about that
not a chance
so this is it
god damn it
honestly please
pardon me
what do the gentlemen plan on doing
its as good as decided
a conference like this is a formality
you need to find a way
to meet chamberlain
you have to prevent this agreement
from being made
chuckles
thank god you can still laugh
show him the proof
what proof
that hitler is bent on a war of conquest
i am in possession of a document
what kind of document
paul trust me please
paul
can i just
just a moment
hugh legat
is one of chamberlains secretaries
can you arrange for him to come to munich
that hes part of the english delegation
possibly yes
will he be expecting
no
but he will help us
all right
right ill do what i can
gentlemen
door closes
and can you get paul into the conference
ill try and add you as an interpreter
i have to get back
whats happening here
do you think
you can smuggle illegal documents
into an international conference
and have a secret meeting
with the british prime minister
right under the führers nose
yes
laughs
oh paul
then you should have this with you
ever used one
as children we used to shoot rabbits

is known to you
cadogan legat
yes
yes sir we were at oxford together
when did you last see him
uh the summer of 32
i visited him in munich
all roads lead to munich
any contact since
no
why not
we had a disagreement
what about
politics
and you havent communicated since
no sir
were sorry about the questions legat
but we need to understand
what sort of relationship you have
or had with this particular german
it seems your friend is part of
the secret opposition to hitler
his position inside the foreign ministry
gives him access to classified material
material hes willing to share with us
or more specifically with you
how do you feel about that
surprised
cadogan but
are you willing to take matters further
i dont understand
he has a document in his possession
and wed very much like to know
what it is
wed like you to go to munich tomorrow
meet with von hartmann
and get the document
i beg your pardon
its not without risk
technically itll be
an act of espionage on foreign soil
this kind of thing sir i
im not really
no one is at first but youll do fine
duty calls legat
im not sure how cleverly will feel
cadogan leave cleverly to us
absolutely we know oscar
and the pm doesnt need to know

the führer began by explaining
that the question is one of space
men singing in german
the german race comprises over 85 million
and this constitutes a more tightlypacked
racial community than any other country
girl speaking german
the only remedy lies
in the acquisition of living space
and this will only be solved
by means of force
in german hows your afternoon
herr von hartmann
arduous frau winter and yours
well im hanging in there
did you meet with your english friend
i did

an agreement for the immediate handover
of the sudetenland
in italian congratulations schmidt
excellent work
thank you
in german to the german empire
well get everything we wanted
i thought it would take
at least another day
yes it would have
if chamberlain had had his way
he wanted to wear down the führer
with the smallest details
the man is a bean counter
have they signed already
what the treaties are being drawn up
right now theyll sign after dinner
and straighten your tie
the two of us have been invited
to the dining room with the führer
oh god

herr von hartmann thats a great honour
yes
quite right fräulein
frau winter
frau winter

conversation resumes
knife taps on glass
himmler to the good health
of our dear italian friends
and to the führer

thres no linen no linen
hugh not yet
you know theyre about to sign
it isnt an easy thing to raise with him
sighs
hmm
then ill do it
oh for gods sake dont be stupid
this is the last moment
do you understand
i wont have it on my conscience
that i did nothing
i feel the same as soon as i can
no no
ill talk to him
not soon now
lets do it together
no
why not we are on the edge
do you have any idea
we are right on the edge
paul
im sorry
whats happened to you
we have to try hugh
please we have to try
sighs
thisll be the end of my career
wheres the document
in my room
come on
secretary is there another hotel nearby
downtown i will call it i will call
thank you that would be great
in the meantime if we can get some linen
so we can have a shower
that would be amazing
listen
hes old and hes exhausted
ill give him the document
and if he agrees to see you
for gods sake
dont give him a moral lecture
just the facts
all right
wait here
door closes
taps on door
oh sorry prime minister
no no no no come on in legat
just having my blood pressure checked
groans
fortunately it looks
as if ill live another day
good night
good night joseph thank you
sighs
so what is it that cant wait hm
weve come into possession
of a significant document
and who is we
i have come into possession of a document
what is it
the minutes of a meeting that hitler held
with his senior commanders last november
mmhm
a meeting in which he explicitly
commits himself to a war of conquest
obviously its all in german
but i believe it to be legitimate
and truthful
and how did this document come to us
a friend gave it to me
in strict confidence
friend
a german diplomat
why does he wish us to have it
i think he should explain that himself
hes waiting outside
does sir horace know about this
no sir
nobody knows
youre exceeding your authority
young man
scoffs i cant possibly meet
with a german diplomat
i understand
but he is risking his life to see you
no
this is most improper
im aware sir
right
three minutes not a moment longer
door opens
youve got three minutes
this is paul von hartmann
of the german foreign ministry
how do you do
thank you for seeing me
im not sure its very wise
for either of us
take a seat close the door legat
ah ah
you better come and join us legat
come on
so get on with it
that document is proof
that hitler is lying
when he claims to have
no further territorial demands
on the contrary
he wants to expand the country
and he will keep on expanding
therefore i beg you
not to sign the agreement tonight
laughing what
prime minister
adolf hitler is a monster
he is a madman
you cannot give him what he wants
hell take more and more land
more and more people will suffer
that is the proof
i applaud your courage young man
but i have to give you
a lesson in political reality
the people of great britain will never
take up arms over a local border dispute
its so much more than a local border
as for what hitler may do
or may not do in the future
well we shall have to wait and see
wait and see is not
my sole objective here
is to avert war in the immediate term
so i can begin to build a lasting peace
there will be no lasting peace
but i have to try
look the worst thing i could do
is to walk away from this conference
if you do there are people waiting
high up in the military
a resistance to bring him down
well why havent they done so already
they will if
i cant rely on some resistance
you may believe exists in the german army
i mean laughs
well i
think you should
take this back to wherever it came from
no
keep it study it
that is the political reality
now youre being impertinent
and you are shaking hands with a man
who hates everything you stand for
he is lying to you
he will go further and further
he will not stop sir he will never sto
thank you for your time
please dont sign the agreement
get rid of this
i have to say legat
im extremely disappointed in you
door closes
sighs
oui bien sûr
in french mr president
of the council
yes
thank you for your cooperation
i think we have come
to a very good agreement
merci beaucoup monsieur

i will take it to london
find a more responsive audience
it wont be a waste

gentle snoring
paul you can talk to her

patients snoring and grunting
lena
lena whimpers
in german its me hugh
lena breathing
patients snoring
in english what happened
we split up
after your trip to munich
sighs
how did she end up here
she was arrested at a protest in 35
and sent to moringen the womens camp
when they discovered she was jewish
they were rough
scoffs
they said she fell out of a window
im sure she did
but not before
they carved a star of david onto her back
i knew he was racist
all the awful jewish stuff
i thought it could be put to one side
how
but you cant put it aside
if they are capable of that
they are capable of anything
lena knew that
yes she did
may i
shall we share
paul coughs
what will you do
carry on
in a few hours i have to present
a press summary to hitler
im told hes taken a shine to me
laughs
maybe its a chance
to really do something
what do you
how
it would solve everything
theyd kill you
for even thinking about it
i have a pistol
i might get a moment alone with him
stop it
dont be stupid
ill take the document to london
it will make a difference
probably more talking yes
yes more talking
i have to fight
you dont have to fight
we dont choose the times we live in
the only choice we have is how we respond
you dont have to fight paul we dont
i have to fight
we need to talk we need to
i have to fight
no you dont no
no its my responsibility understand
your responsibility
or i may as well blow my brains out
there are other ways of doing things
talk discussion
theres no other things no
theres always hope
sighs hoping is waiting
for someone else to do it
wed all be much better off without it
both sigh
birdsong
women laughing and speaking german
id miss you
goodbye
goodbye
regina palace hotel
hello
hello
bit early for a walk
yes
i i couldnt sleep
i had to clear my head

why are you standing out here
im looking for you
the pms awake and he wants to see you
taps on door
i heard you were looking for me sir
ah legat good morning
dont suppose
you brought that copy of the times with
with hitlers speech in it did you

oh good man can you find it for me
had a word with him last night
asked if i might see him again
this morning before we fly back
hugh asked who sir
herr hitler
did did he agree
chuckles couldnt really refuse
must say that was a remarkably rude young
man you brought to see me last night
i really am sorry about that sir
ah thank you
have you told anyone about it
no
good neither have i
his arguments were naive
but they were not ineffective
now here we are
listen id like you
to take this to wilson
ask him to turn it
into a short statement of intent
just from there to there
sir i dont follow
well on monday night
hitler publicly declared his desire
for a permanent peace
between germany and great britain
yes
well id like his undertaking redrafted
in the form of a joint statement
a joint statement
to which both he and i
can put our names this morning
oh get on with it go on get it done
and get yourself a coffee
youre half awake
we regard the agreement signed last night
as symbolic of the desire
of our two peoples
never to go to war
with one another again
i hope the pm realises
this has no legal force whatsoever
the mans not a fool
what the hells he playing at
ive no idea
first i heard of it was half an hour ago
do you have it
wilson yes
good
it may be a little long
hmm
mumbles
what if he refuses to sign it
chamberlain why should he
these are all statements
hes made already
wilson it doesnt mean
hes going to stick with them
its symbolic horace
last nights agreement
only settles a tiny dispute
there will be others
and i want him
to publicly commit himself to peace
oh legat make sure
theres a car available at 1100
to the führerbau
no ah youve put my name before his
it should be the other way around
otherwise good
yes i wanted to have
a private meeting with him
man to man no officials
he invited me to his apartment
what
no officials
not even you horace
oh for gods sake you cant go
and see hitler entirely on your own
can and will
gentlemen we must rise
to the level of events
sighs

i cant explain it any more
prime minister
yes

no
i thought i had made this perfectly clear
no officials
not as an official sir as a translator
no i want him to feel
this is a personal meeting
you need someone there to make sure
your words are accurately reported
i
remember what happened at berchtesgaden
when he refused to give us a copy
no that
you cant trust schmidt to have your back
i think a translator could be useful
im the only one who speaks german
all right all right all right
sighs
you can come but be discreet
keep out of his eyeline and mine
reporters clamouring
mr chamberlain
mr chamberlain
mr chamberlain

schmidt im pleased to hear that sir
knocking
scribbling
chamberlain we the german führer
and british prime minister
are agreed in respect of the future
of anglogerman relations

dr schmidt wird sie zurück
ins hotel begleiten
schmidt in english

to protect germany
ich möchte dem hinzufügen
ich habe nie daran gezweifelt
zu was sie alles bereit wären
um deutschland zu schützen
officer in german
the foreign press summary
in english thank you come along legat
teacup clinking
knocking at door
man in german
the reichsführer is arriving
please excuse me my führer
hitler the cheers for hitler
were mechanical and polite
for chamberlain they were ecstatic
chuckles
you as an educated german
what do you think are they right
i do not wish to be followed mechanically
i gave germany back its dignity
is it too much
to ask for a little gratitude
mechanical
theyre grateful
to this arsehole chamberlain
am i the only one who realises
that we have a historic task ahead of us
that this is the moment
for germany to fulfil its destiny
speak i want you to answer me
why arent they grateful
the people dont want a war
theyre afraid
the people dont know what they want
theyre children
but youre right they are afraid
i am surrounded by cowardice
yes my führer
i told you i can read people
you say yes
but your eyes
are saying no
its just you and i here
so
what are you thinking von hartmann
what do you
want to say to me
nothing
knock at door
heil my führer
im told youve signed another agreement
with chamberlain
dont take that so seriously
that piece of paper is of no significance
the problem lies here
with the german people
anything else
clicks heels
thank you
for
this
shuddering
thank you
in english i hope you dont mind they
asked me to share a ride to the airport
im glad to have a moment alone with you
i havent been
altogether straight with you

in london you asked my surname
its menzies
i think you know my uncle
hes a colonel in the foreign office

oh god
i shall have to speak to the cameras
the world doesnt yet know
about our joint statement
prime minister i urge you
to treat the undertaking given by hitler
with the utmost caution
ah
the agreement on the sudetenland
is one thing but this other document
yes i know horace look
if theres one thing ive learned
from my dealings with mr hitler
its that you cant play poker
with a gangster
without any cards up your sleeve
what if he breaks his word
youll look like a fool
well if he breaks his word the world
will see him for who he truly is
and itll unite the allies
might even bring the americans on board
and if im made to look a fool
well its a small price to pay
wilson sighs
horace i can only play the game
with the cards ive been dealt

rather than avoided one
there are thousands of people
gathering on the mall
welcome back sir congratulations
wilson the king intends
to take him out onto the balcony
the settlement
of the czechoslovakian problem
which has been achieved

merely a prelude to a larger settlement
which for all europe
may bring peace
cheering and applause

just a delay the pms given us a chance
of winning the damn thing when it happens

sooner or later
one day soon we will have to fight
and we will have to win

withering hours
the gentle days keeping us warm
in your arms flowers
turn to promises
lena in english ill take it
that linger until dawn
you dream of summer
oh you speak russian as well right
of hearing bluebells chime
your golden locks
drenched in moonlight
ballgoers cheering
sitting in silence
as we watch the birds fly by
come dance with me
into the dark blue night
cheering and laughter
come dance with me
into the dark blue night
the nightingale cries
in the meadows
as the dew drops from my eyes
you dream of summer
of hearing bluebells chime
your golden locks
drenched in moonlight
sitting in silence
as we watch the birds fly by
come dance with me
into the dark blue night
come dance with me
into the dark blue night
and every year
the free birds fly
into the distance
under auburn skies
fading to black
the forest sighs
waiting for spring
to bring them back
and every year
the free birds fly
into the distance
under auburn skies
fading to black
the forest sighs
waiting for spring
to bring them back
you dream of summer

your golden locks
