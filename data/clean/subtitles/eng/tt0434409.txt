i know of no reason
why the gunpowder treason
should ever be forgot
but what of the man 
i know his name was guy fawkes
and i know in 1605  he attempted
to blow up the houses of parliament 
but who was he really 
what was he like 
 dogs barking 
 woman  we are told to remember
the idea and not the man 
because a man can fail 
he can be caught 
he can be killed and forgotten 
but 400 years later
an idea can still change the world 
i have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas 
i ve seen people kill
in the name of them   
 crowd yelling 
   and die defending them 
but you cannot kiss an idea
cannot touch it or hold it 
ideas do not bleed 
they do not feel pain 
they do not love 
and it is not an idea that i miss 
it is a man 
a man that made me remember
the 5th of november 
a man that i will never forget 
so i read that the former united states
is so desperate for medical supplies
that they have allegedly sent several
containers filled with wheat and tobacco 
a gesture  they said  of goodwill 
you wanna know what i think 
well  you re listening to my show 
so i will assume you do 
it s high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them 
i think it s payback time for a tea party
they threw for us a few hundred years ago 
i say we go down to those docks tonight
and dump that crap
where everything from the ulcered sphincter
of ass erica belongs 
who s with me  who s bloody with me 
 tv audience applauding 
did you like that 
usa  ulcered sphincter of ass erica 
i mean  what else can you say 
here was a country that had everything 
absolutely everything 
and now  20 years later  is what 
the world s biggest leper colony  why 
godlessness 
let me say that again 
godlessness 
it wasn t the war they started 
it wasn t the plague they created 
it was judgment 
no one escapes their past 
no one escapes judgment 
you think he s not up there 
you think he s not watching over
this country 
how else can you explain it 
he tested us  but we came through 
we did what we had to do 
islington  enfield 
i was there  i saw it all 
immigrants  muslims 
homosexuals  terrorists 
disease ridden degenerates 
they had to go 
strength through unity 
unity through faith 
i am a god fearing englishman 
and i m goddamn proud of it 
that s quite enough of that 
thank you very much 
oh  shit 
 woman over speaker 
a yellow coded curfew is now in effect 
any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest 
this is for your protection 
a yellow coded curfew

  she just threatened us 
  that she did  that she did 
you know what that means 
don t you 
it means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion 
and you get to swallow it 
  oh  god  you re fingermen 
  she s getting the picture 
no  please  i didn t know  i m sorry 
not yet you re not  but you will be 
by sunup  if you re not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of london   
then you ll certainly be the sorest 
oh  god  no  please don t do this 
i ll go home 
i won t do it again  i swear  please 
  what do you think  lads 
  spare the rod  spoil the child 
help me  someone help 
 v  the multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him 
   fingerman  what the hell 
   willy  bugger off 
disdaining fortune 
with his brandish d steel
which smoked with bloody execution 
 fingerman 
we re fingermen  pal 
 v  aha 
 yells 
 whimpering 
jesus christ  mercy 
we are oft to blame in this   
 tis too much proved 
   that with devotion s visage
and pious action
we do sugar o er the devil himself 
  what s that mean 
  spare the rod 
 truncheon drops 
i can assure you  i mean you no harm 
  who are you 
  who 
who is but the form
following the function of what
and what i am is a man in a mask 
  oh  i can see that 
  of course you can 
i m not questioning your powers
of observation 
i m merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is 
  oh  right 
  but on this most auspicious of nights
permit me then  in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet
to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona 
voil√† 
in view  a humble
vaudevillian veteran
cast vicariously as both victim
and villain by the vicissitudes of fate 
this visage 
no mere veneer of vanity
is a vestige of the vox populi 
now vacant  vanished 
however  this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified
and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice
and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition 
the only verdict is vengeance 
a vendetta
held as a votive not in vain 
for the value and veracity of such
shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous 
 v chuckles 
verily  this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose 
so let me simply add that it s
my very good honor to meet you
and you may call me v 
are you  like  a crazy person 
i am quite sure they will say so 
but to whom  might i ask 
am i speaking 
  i m evey 
  evey 
e vey  of course you are 
  what does that mean 
  it means that i  like god 
do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence 
are you hurt 
no  i m fine 
  thanks to you 
  oh  i merely played my part 
  but tell me  do you enjoy music  evey 
  i suppose 
you see  i m a musician of sorts
and on my way to give
a very special performance 
what kind of musician 
percussion instruments are my speciality 
but tonight i intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event
and would be honored
if you could join me 
i don t think so 
i should be getting home 
i promise you  it ll be like
nothing you ve ever seen 
and afterwards 
you ll return home safely 
all right 
 evey  it s beautiful up here 
 v  a more perfect stage
could not be asked for 
i don t see any instruments 
your powers of observation
continue to serve you well 
but wait  it is to madame justice
that i dedicate this concerto
in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts
and in recognition of the impostor
that stands in her stead 
tell me  do you know
what day it is  evey 
um   
  november the 4th 
  not anymore 
 bells chiming 
remember  remember
the 5th of november
the gunpowder treason and plot
i know of no reason
why the gunpowder treason
should ever be forgot
first  the overture 
yes 
yes  the strings 
listen carefully  can you hear it 
now the brass 
i can hear it 
 tchaikovsky s  1812 overture 
playing over speakers 
look outside  mommy 
they re playing music 
  how do you do that 
  wait 
here comes the crescendo 
 v laughing 
how beautiful  is it not 
gentlemen  you have had four hours 
you had better have results  mr  creedy 
the bailey area is quarantined 
all significant witnesses
have been detained 
good  mr  etheridge 
a recording device was found wired into
the central emergency broadcast system 
the dcd was tchaikovsky s
1812 overture 
add it to the blacklist 
i never want to hear that music again 
yes  sir 
we also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance
indicating a high percentage
of conversation about the explosion 
mr  dascomb 
what are we doing about that 
we re calling it
an emergency demolition 
we have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the interlink 
experts have been lined up to testify
against the bailey s structural integrity 
i want prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings
and how we must avoid clinging
to the edifice of a decadent past 
he should conclude that the new bailey
will become the symbol of our time
and the future
that our conviction has rewarded us 
mr  heyer 
our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist
though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible 
we also managed to get a picture of
the girl that creedy s men were detaining 
  who is she  mr  finch 
  not sure yet  sir 
  but we re working on several leads 
  anything else 
we located the fireworks launch
and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites 
unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication
these devices were homemade
with over the counter chemicals
making them very difficult to trace 
whoever he is  chancellor 
he s very good 
spare us your professional annotations 
mr  finch  they are irrelevant 
apologies  chancellor 
gentlemen  this is a test 
moments such as these
are matters of faith 
to fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe 
everything we have fought for 
doubt will plunge this country back
into chaos  and i will not let that happen 
gentlemen  i want this
terrorist found
and i want him to understand
what terror really means 
england prevails 
 all  england prevails 
 tv theme music plays 
   woman  you think people will buy this 
   dascomb  why not 
this is the btn 
our job is to report the news 
not fabricate it 
that s the government s job 
on the lighter side of things
seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the old bailey
wanted to give the old girl a grand 
albeit improvised  sendoff 
although the demolition had been
planned for some time
the music and the fireworks were 
according to the crew chief 
   definitely not on the schedule  
   man on tv  we ll be right back 
do you believe that load of bollocks 
i mean  there was no bloody demolition 
i saw it  the whole thing 
  did you see it 
  no  last night i was   
yeah  that s right  you went
to see daddy deitrich  didn t you 
evey  there you are 
  you are still working for me 
  sorry  patricia 
i need two espressos and three coffees 
and deitrich is ready for his tea 
 man  i don t get it 
why does he wear a guy fawkes mask
and then blow up the bailey 
didn t fawkes try to blow up parliament 
it s not too late 
he s still got another 16 hours 
maybe he s just getting started 
 phone ringing 
yeah 
okay  a lead on the girl 
 man  look  don t get me wrong 
i love it  a cow getting crucified 
it s hysterical 
but you ll never get it approved 
you ve got to rewrite it  okay  gotta go 
i don t recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman 
  mr  deitrich   
  gordon  please 
i don t need  mister  to make
this body feel any older 
gordon   
i was on my way last night 
but there were fingermen
and i got scared and went home 
sadly  after last night 
i think our curfew will only get worse 
gotcha 
  hey  fred 
   fred  all that been x rayed 
nope  they re filled with bombs 
well  wait till commercials
to set them off  okay 
  i can t believe you watch that shit 
 fred  what 
laser lass is banging 
 indistinct chatter 
what s all that 
not sure  they just arrived 
marked for stage 3 
must be prothero 
i wish someone had the balls to tell that
brat this station ain t his playground 
what the hell is this 
just put them over there
until i can figure out what they re for 
this looks serious 
her parents were political activists 
  they were detained when she was 12 
  what happened to her 
 finch  juvenile reclamation project
  for five years 
 dominic  shit

 beeping 
 alarm wailing

the rest of you follow me 
 man over speaker  attention  attention

dominic 
police  out of the way

i ll tell you what i know 
i ll tell you what i know 
i ll tell you what i know 
england prevails 
  clear the halls 
 officer  sir 
help  storm  help 
 man  don t touch it 
dad  what s wrong with the telly 
 v  good evening  london 
  allow me first to apologize 
  that s the emergency channel 
i do  like many of you  appreciate
the comforts of the everyday routine
the security of the familiar 
the tranquility of repetition 
bloody hell 
i enjoy them as much as any bloke 
but in the spirit of commemoration   
  who s that  mum 
  shh 
   whereby important events
of the past
usually associated
with someone s death
or the end of some awful 
bloody struggle
are celebrated with a nice holiday
i thought we could mark
this november the 5th
a day that is  sadly 
no longer remembered
by taking time out of our daily lives
to sit down and have a little chat 
there are  of course 
those who do not want us to speak 
let me think  let me think 
even now  orders are being shouted
into telephones
and men with guns
will soon be on their way 
  it s chancellor sutler 
  damn it 
why  because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation
words will always retain their power 
words offer the means to meaning
and  for those who will listen 
the enunciation of truth 
and the truth is
there is something terribly wrong
with this country  isn t there 
you designed it  you wanted it foolproof 
you said every television in london 
cruelty and injustice 
intolerance and oppression 
and where once
you had the freedom to object
to think and speak as you saw fit
you now have censors and surveillance
coercing your conformity
  and soliciting submission 
  cameras  we need cameras 
how did this happen 
who s to blame 
certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others 
and they will be held accountable 
but again  truth be told 
if you re looking for the guilty
you need only look into a mirror 
i know why you did it 
i know you were afraid 
who wouldn t be  war  terror  disease 
there were a myriad of problems
which conspired
to corrupt your reason
and rob you of your common sense 
fear got the best of you 
and in your panic  you turned to
the now high chancellor adam sutler 
he promised you order 
he promised you peace
and all he demanded in return
was your silent  obedient consent 
  inspector  they re almost through 
  last night  i sought to end that silence 
last night  i destroyed the old bailey
to remind this country
of what it has forgotten 
more than 400 years ago  a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of november
forever in our memory 
his hope was to remind the world
that fairness  justice and freedom
are more than words 
they are perspectives 
so if you ve seen nothing 
if the crimes of this government
remain unknown to you 
then i would suggest that you allow
the 5th of november to pass unmarked 
but if you see what i see 
if you feel as i feel 
and if you would seek as i seek 
then i ask you to stand beside me 
one year from tonight
outside the gates of parliament 
and together  we shall give them
a 5th of november
that shall never  ever be forgot 
kerosene fog

by the response time of london s finest 
i hadn t expected you to be
quite so johnny on the spot 
we were here before you even started 
bad luck  chummy 
oh  i don t know about that 
aah 
we re interrupting your regular program
to bring you this terrifying report
of a terrorist takeover of jordan tower
which ended only moments ago 
a psychotic terrorist 
identified only as the letter v
attacked the control booth with
high powered explosives and weapons
that he used against unarmed civilians
in order to broadcast a message of hate 
we ve just received this footage
of a daring police raid 
 officer on tv  stop 
stop  stay where you are  or we ll shoot 
stay where you are 
now  this is only an initial report
but at this time  it s believed
that during this heroic raid 
the terrorist was shot and killed 
bollocks 
again  from what we ve been told
by authorities  the danger is now over 
the terrorist is dead 
 finch 
right there  what s he thinking 
is he considering leaving her 
after she just saved him 
he s a terrorist  you can t expect him
to act like you or me 
some part of him s human 
and  for better or worse 
she s stuck with him 
 julie london s  cry me a river 
playing nearby 
  you scared me 
  my apologies 
  are you feeling all right 
  yes  thank you 
  what is this place 
  it s my home 
  i call it the shadow gallery 
  it s beautiful 
  where did you get all this stuff 
  oh  here and there 
much of it from the vaults of
the ministry of objectionable materials 
  you stole them 
  heavens  no 
stealing implies ownership 
you can t steal from the censor 
i merely reclaimed them 
god  if they ever find this place 
i suspect if they do  a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries 
 evey 
you mean  after what you ve done 
god  what have i done 
i maced that detective 
why did i do that 
  you did what you thought was right 
  no  i shouldn t have done that 
i must have been out of my mind 
is that what you really think 
or what they d want you to think 
i think i should go 
  may i ask where 
  home  i have to go home 
they re looking for you 
if they know where you work 
they know where you live 
  i have friends  i could stay with them 
  i m afraid that won t work either 
you have to understand  evey 
i didn t want this for either of us
but i couldn t see any other way 
you were unconscious
and i had to make a decision 
if i had left you there  right now you d be
in one of creedy s interrogation cells 
they d imprison you  torture you 
and  in all probability  kill you
in the pursuit of finding me 
after what you did 
i couldn t let that happen
so i picked you up and carried you
to the only place i knew you d be safe 
here  to my home 
i won t tell anyone  i swear 
you know you can trust me 
i m sorry  but i can t take that risk 
but i don t even know where this is 
 v  you know it s underground 
you know the color of the stone 
  that d be enough for a clever man 
  are you saying that i have to stay here 
only until i m done  after the 5th 
i no longer think it ll matter 
you mean a year from now 
i have to stay here for a year 
sorry  evey 
i didn t know what else to do 
you should ve left me alone 
why didn t you just leave me alone 
 v sighs

she died in a hunger strike  he died

and that ain t the worst of it 
her brother was at st  mary s 
  christ

so we know her story 
now we need his 
 stan getz s  the girl from ipanema

your appetite 
  no  please  it s just    are you all right 
  yes  yes  yes  i m fine 
can i ask what happened

ancient history  for some 
not really very good
table conversation 
now  would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg 
  yes  thank you  i m starving  actually 
  have a seat 
mmm 
  it s delicious 
  good 
god  i haven t had real butter
since i was a little girl 
where did you get it

who dares more is none 
  macbeth 
  very good 
my mum  she used to
read all his plays to me
and ever since 
i ve always wanted to act 
be in plays  movies 
when i was 9  i played viola
in twelfth night  mum was very proud 
 v  where is your mother now 
she s dead 
 v  i m sorry 
can i ask about
what you said on the telly 
  did you mean it 
  every word 
you really think blowing up parliament s
going to make this country a better place 
 v  there s no certainty 
only opportunity 
you can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up 
creedy ll black bag
every one of them 
 v  people should not be afraid
of their governments 
governments should be afraid
of their people 
and you ll make that happen
by blowing up a building 
 v  the building is a symbol 
as is the act of destroying it 
symbols are given power by people 
alone  a symbol is meaningless 
but with enough people 
blowing up a building
can change the world 
i wish i believed that was possible 
every time i ve seen this world change 
it s always been for the worse 
i ll tell you what i know 
i know this is not a man 
 tv audience applauding 
 prothero  what is he 
 prothero on tv 
a man does not wear a mask 
  what is he 
  a man does not threaten civilians 
he s what every gutless 
freedom hating terrorist is 
a goddamn coward 
 phone ringing 
there will be no negotiation 
when i arrive in the morning 
the paddy will be gone 
i m looking at the tape right now 
and he has no idea how to light me 
my nose looks like big fucking ben 
listen to me  you bleeding sod 
england prevails because i say it does 
so does every lazy cunt on this show 
and that includes you 
find another dop
or find yourself another job 
i ll tell you what i wish 
i wish i d been there 
i wish i d had the chance
for a face to face 
just one chance  that s all i d need 
this so called v and his accomplice 
evey hammond
neo demagogues 
spouting their message of hate 
a delusional and aberrant voice
delivering a terrorist s ultimatum 
an ultimatum that was met
with swift and surgically precise justice 
  no mercy 
  the moral  ladies and gentlemen  is 
 together 
good guys win  bad guys lose
and  as always  england prevails 
holy christ  jesus 
good evening  commander prothero 
oh  my god  how did you get in here 
don t worry  i ve made sure
our reunion won t be disturbed by
any pesky late night phone calls 
commander 
stop  why do you keep calling me that 
that was your title  remember 
when we first met  all those years ago 
you wore a uniform in those days 
you 
  it is you 
  the ghost of christmas past 
 phone ringing 
  yeah 
 dascomb  finch  it s dascomb 
  dascomb 
  i ve already called the chancellor 
  we have to get control of the situation 
  what situation 
chancellor sutler agreed  for obvious
reasons  we have to keep this discreet 
in the wrong light 
the loss of the voice of london
could be devastating
to our credibility 
perhaps a stroke 
no  no  it s too horrific 
a quiet  dignified death in his sleep 
  we got any eyes or ears on this 
  no  camcos were cut 
it s the same m o  as before 
but we got an elevator log id 
  let me guess 
  she s in deep  inspector 
 metal clanging 
v 
 soaring music playing on tv 
 v chuckles 
my fat  metal friend 
 imitates choking noises 
 grunting 
mondego 
oh  god  i hope i didn t wake you 
no  i just thought you were fighting 
i mean  for real 
 v  my favorite film 
the count of monte cristo 
with robert donat as edmond dantes 
it is not my sword  mondego 
but your past that disarmed you 
it gets me every time 
  never seen it 
  really 
  would you like to 
  does it have a happy ending 
 v  as only celluloid can deliver 
okay 
put the sword away 
forensics just wrapped 
no prints  no hair  no fibers 
the guy is like a ghost 
you won t believe
what they found on prothero 
  drugs 
  could ve started his own hospital 
  interesting 
  why 
did you know lewis prothero was
one of the richest men in the country
before he was the voice of london 
  drugs 
  legal ones 
major stockholder
in viadoxic pharmaceutical 
viadoxic and st  mary s
in less than a week  coincidence 
when you re at this as long as i ve been 
you stop believing in coincidence 
may we come up 
   dantes  you find your own tree 
   v  you find your own tree 
  did you like it 
  yeah 
  but it made me feel sorry for mercedes 
  why 
because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her 
   nationwide were devastated
as news of the most popular   
wait  what s this 
   most awarded stars
in the history of the btn
a man known to the entire nation
as  the voice of london 
passed away late last night
from apparent heart failure 
  she s lying 
  how do you know 
she blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false 
it came as no surprise
to those who knew him
that his body was at his office
where he often worked long hours
after everyone else had gone home 
lewis  you will be sorely missed 
v  yesterday i couldn t find my id 
you didn t take it  did you 
 v  would you prefer a lie or the truth 
did you have anything
to do with that 
  yes  i killed him 
  you 
  oh  god 
  you re upset 
i m upset 
you just said you killed lewis prothero 
i might have killed the fingermen that
attacked you  i heard no objection 
  what 
  violence can be used for good 
  what are you talking about 
  justice 
oh  i see 
 v  there s no court in this country
for men like prothero 
and are you going to kill more people 
 v  yes 
take a look at this 
prothero s military record 
what do you see 
iraq  kurdistan  syria 
before and after  sudan 
  busy boy 
  but after all that
they put him in charge
of a detention facility at larkhill 
well  no good deed goes unpunished 
you think there s a connection
between our boy and larkhill 
it might explain the connection
between him and the hammond girl 
problem is  i can t find
any other record of it 
larkhill  larkhill  i cannot recall
that particular facility  inspector 
  you re welcome to review our records 
  we ve been through your records 
all it says is that there was
a detention facility at larkhill
approximately 10 miles
north of salisbury 
well  there you have it 
this is a matter of some urgency  major 
we need to know if there was anything
different about this facility 
i m sorry  inspector 
i simply cannot recall 
was there a specific profile
for those being sent there 
  usual undesirables  i should think 
  but do you know 
  of course not  i wasn t stationed there 
  do you know who was 
i cannot recall specific names 
but if you look through our records   
your records are either deleted 
omitted or missing 
as head of the detention program
at that   
before you go further  let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then 
now we don t have the problems
we had back then 
we all did what we had to do 
and in those circumstances 
we did the best we could 
that s all i have to say about that 
you can do this 
hi 
i ve been thinking 
there s something
i want to ask you
but i don t think you ll understand why
unless you know a few things about me 
my father was a writer 
you would have liked him 
he used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth
while politicians used them
to cover the truth up 
 v  a man after my own heart 
he always told the best stories 
until my brother died 
that was when everything changed 
my brother was one of the students
at st  mary s 
after he died 
my parents became political 
they protested the war
and the reclamation 
when sutler was appointed high chancellor 
they were at the riot in leeds 
i watched on the television 
thinking i was going
to see my parents killed 
i remember them arguing at night 
mum wanted to leave the country 
dad refused 
he said if we ran away 
they would win 
win  like
it was a game 
 door opens 
evey  quick  hide 
  mummy 
   evey s mother  evey 
 evey 
i never saw them again 
it was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth 
i m sorry  evey 
no  i m the one that s sorry 
sorry i m not a stronger person 
sorry i m not like my parents 
i wish i was   
but i m not 
i wish i wasn t afraid all the time   
but i am 
i know this world is screwed up 
believe me  i know it better than most 
which is why i wanted to ask  if there is
anything i can do to help make it right 
please let me know 
 v  if you wish 
do you really think
you ll find something here 
worth a shot 
one thing is true of all governments 
the most reliable records are tax records 
it appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost 
probably during the reclamation 
a lot of things went missing back then 
but i found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault 
everything we ve got on larkhill
is in there 
thanks  this is a great help 
 evey speaking in latin 
 v   by the power of truth  i  while living 
have conquered the universe  
  personal motto 
  from faust 
that s about trying
to cheat the devil  isn t it 
 v  it is  and speaking of the devil 
i was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing 
  of course 
  it appears that unforeseen circumstances
have accelerated my original plan 
as a result  i m in need of someone
with some theatrical skill 
i ll do my best 
 v  i believe you will 
another doctor  why does
a detention facility need so many doctors 
i don t know  but this is interesting 
the highest paid person
at the camp was a priest 
  really 
  yeah  father lilliman 
  lilliman 
  was paid almost 200 grand a month 
now  that is interesting 
looks like he was promoted 
he s a bishop now 
  your grace 
  oh  denis 
  has everything been arranged 
  yes 
i ve just received
your interlink itinerary 
you should arrive in perth
in time for mass 
you re most diligent  denis 
a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our lord  but   
  your grace 
  it wasn t labor i was speaking of 
it was  rather  my final remittance
that i was interested in 
my last little joy 
i m sorry  your grace 
she has arrived  but there was
some confusion at the agency 
they ve sent a new girl who 
i m afraid  is a little older than usual 
older 
oh  dear  she s not too old  i trust 
that is for your grace to decide 
  oh  my 
  your grace 
to think that i doubted your loveliness
for an instant 
mea culpa  my child 
mea culpa 
your grace  we don t have much time
and i have to tell you something 
a confession  i love the confession game 
tell me your sins 
this isn t a game  your grace 
someone s coming 
i think he means to kill you 
  i m sorry 
  i m telling you this
because i want some kind
of protection or amnesty 
i had nothing to do with the bailey
and made a mistake in the jordan tower 
  i think this should balance it out 
  what are you talking about 
i m evey hammond  i m   
i ve been the prisoner of the terrorist v
for the past several weeks 
i m telling you that  any moment 
he s going to come through that door 
i unlocked the window in the room
where denis told me to get ready 
 laughing  wonderful 
it s a game i ve never played 
what a delightful mind you have 
i hope the rest of you
is just as interesting 
  no  please  you have to believe me 
  oh  i do  i do  i do 
let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs 
stop it  get off of me 
seems i ve captured
a dangerous terrorist 
now  how best to procure
her confession 
oh 
you little bitch 
you fucking little whore 
 v  reverend 
  oh  my god 
she wasn t lying  it is you 
i m sorry 
  i had to 
 v  evey 
and thus i clothe my naked villainy
with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ
and seem a saint 
when most i play the devil 
oh  please  have mercy 
oh  not tonight  bishop 
not tonight 
 lilliman over speaker 
don t do this  i beg of you 
well  then 
children s hour at the abbey 
 v  open your mouth
and stick out your tongue 
  what the    
   lilliman i don t want to die 
this is surveillance 109 
we have an emergency 
 camera shutter clicks 
run every name in that file 
i want the whereabouts of all of them 
  tonight 
  yes  sir 
pucker up  here comes the finger 
yeah  get going  i ll handle him 
creedy 
what are you doing here 
several prominent party members
have been murdered  chief inspector 
this is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention 
the chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement 
it ll be hard to investigate
if you re detaining all my witnesses 
the security of information is paramount 
in these volatile times 
mistakes like jordan tower
can no longer be tolerated 
if  indeed 
jordan tower was an accident 
  what does that mean 
  terrorist seems to have
a rather intimate understanding
of our system 
the chancellor suspects
there might be an informer 
are you saying i m under surveillance 
mr  creedy 
at this time  it would behoove you
to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed
and concentrate on the concerns
of our present 
you mean larkhill 
major wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor 
  his loyalty is not in question 
  but mine is 
your mother was irish  wasn t she 
terrible what st  mary s
did to ireland  wasn t it 
i ve been a party member for 27 years 
if i were you  chief inspector 
i d find the terrorist
and i d find him soon 
 doorbell rings 
 siren wailing nearby 
please 
evey  good god 
i m sorry 
i didn t know where else to go 
yes  well  you better come inside
before someone sees you 
  cheers 
  i know every cop s looking for me 
i know it s horrible of me
to put you in this situation 
  evey   
  you could be in terrible trouble 
evey  listen to me 
if the government searched my house 
you would be the least of my problems 
you trusted me 
it would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you 
oh  my god 
that s god save the queen 
my parents took me to it
when they hung it at gallery 12 
  i thought sutler had it destroyed 
  he believes he did 
cost me more than this house 
but no matter how bad i feel 
it always cheers me up 
  what is that 
  it s a copy of the koran  14th century 
  are you a muslim 
  no  i m in television 
but why would you keep it 
i don t have to be muslim to find
the images beautiful or poetry moving 
is it worth it  if they found that here   
i told you 
you d be the least of my worries 
thank you  gordon 
  thank you so much 
  it s all right 
this whole thing started the night
he blew up the old bailey 
i was on my way here  and   
ah 
yes 
you see  we are both fugitives
in our own way 
  but   
  you re wondering why
you were invited here to supper
in the first place
if my appetites were
for less conventional fare 
unfortunately  a man in my position
is expected to entertain
young and attractive ladies
like yourself 
because in this world 
if i were to invite who i desired 
i would undoubtedly find myself
without a home  let alone a tv show 
  i m sorry 
  not as sorry as i am 
the truth is  after so many years 
you begin to lose
more than just your appetite 
you wear a mask for so long 
you forget who you were beneath it 
i m sorry  chief inspector 
same basic toxicology as prothero 
you could get these poisons
from any house in london 
thanks  delia 
 delia 
any leads on finding this guy 
nothing yet  but there s something else
you can help me with 
you started as a botanist  didn t you 
it s    it s a scarlet carson 
they re believed to be extinct 
he leaves them at the crime scenes 
i d appreciate it
if you could have a look at it 
any information could be helpful 
  of course 
   phone ringing 
excuse me 
yeah 
 dominic  i just finished
going through the file  inspector 
you better get back here 
 finch  yeah  okay 
  my god  he s killed them all 
   dominic  all but one 
   finch  who is she 
   dominic  not sure 
she s clearly one of the people
in charge at larkhill 
but after they shut it down 
she disappeared for two years 
till she applied for an overseas visa 
which was denied 
running away 
probably  because after that 
all record of her seems to stop 
  she changed her name 
  that s what i m guessing 
i put a call in to the registry 
but i haven t heard back 
  it s late  or early 
  call them again  i want that name 
what  are you sure about that 
okay  thank you 
dr  diana stanton changed her name
to delia surridge 
  the coroner 
  yeah 
jesus  i just saw her 
 wind whistling 
it s you  isn t it 
  you ve come to kill me 
   v  yes 
thank god 
 siren wailing 
 operator  i m sorry  but i can t get
a response from that number 
there s a problem with the connection 
jesus christ 
he s there 
 delia  after what happened 
after what they did 
i thought about killing myself 
but i knew that one day
you d come for me 
i didn t know what
they were going to do 
i swear to you 
read my journal 
what they did was only possible
because of you 
oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war 
he changed the entire course
of human history 
is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope 
i have not come
for what you hoped to do 
i ve come for what you did 
it s funny 
i was given one of your roses today 
i wasn t sure you were the terrorist
until i saw it 
what a strange coincidence 
that i should be given one today 
there are no coincidences  delia 
only the illusion of coincidence 
i have another rose 
and this one is for you 
  you re going to kill me now 
  i killed you 10 minutes ago
while you slept 
  is there any pain 
  no 
thank you 
is it meaningless to apologize 
 v  never 
i m so sorry 
 siren wailing 
damn it 
 finch  the terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it 
he wanted us to know the story 
or at least a part of it 
am i to understand that you have read
this document  inspector 
  yes  sir 
  has anyone else read it 
  no  sir 
  then let me make this perfectly clear 
the contents of this document
are a matter of national security
constituting an assault on the character
of several important party members
as well as a blatant violation
of the articles of allegiance 
as the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified 
it could be an elaborate forgery
created by the terrorist
as easily as it could be the deranged
fantasy of a former party member
who resigned for psychological reasons 
any discussion of this document
or its contents
will be regarded  at the very least 
as an act of sedition
if not a willful act of treason 
  is that understood  mr  finch 
  yes  sir 
you would do well  inspector 
to put it out of your mind 
 delia  may 23rd 
my first batch of subjects arrived today
and i have to admit that i m very excited 
this could be the dawn of a new age 
nuclear power is meaningless
in a world where a virus
can kill an entire population
and leave its wealth intact 
   guard 1  stay together 
   guard 2  come on  move 
 delia  may 27th 
commander prothero toured the lab
with a priest  father lilliman 
who i was told is here to monitor
for rules and rights violations 
it made me nervous  but the commander
assured me there wouldn t be a problem 
june 2nd 
i keep wondering if these people knew
how they might be helping their country 
if they would act any differently 
they re so weak and pathetic 
they never look you in the eye 
i find myself hating them 
august the 18th 
of the original four dozen 
over 75 percent are now deceased 
no controllable pattern has yet emerged 
september the 18th 
there is one case that continues
to give me hope 
he exhibits none of the immune system
pathologies the other subjects developed 
i ve discovered cellular anomalies in his
blood that i ve been unable to categorize 
the mutations seem to have triggered
the abnormal development
of basic kinesthesia and reflexes 
the subject said
he could no longer remember
who he was or where he was from 
whoever he was 
he is now the key to our dream
and the hope that all of this
will not have been in vain 
november the 5th 
it started last night  around midnight 
the first explosions tore open
the entire medical section 
all my work  gone 
i was trying to understand how
it could ve happened when i saw him 
the man from room 5 
he looked at me 
not with eyes  there were no eyes 
but i know he was looking at me
because i felt it 
 yells 
 delia  oh  god 
what have i done 
 sten getz s  corcovado  playing 
bonjour  mademoiselle 
what is that you re making 
we called it  eggie in the basket  
my mum made them 
  this is weird 
  what 
the first morning i was with him 
he made me eggs just like this 
  really 
  i swear 
that is a strange coincidence 
although there s an obvious explanation 
  there is 
  yes  evey 
i am v 
at last you know the truth 
you re stunned  i know 
hard to believe  isn t it  that beneath
this wrinkled  well fed exterior 
there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for fawkesian masks 
viva la revoluci√≥n 
that is not funny  gordon 
yeah  i know 
i m useless without a studio audience 
i ve seen people go to jail
for less than that 
of course  he was right  wasn t he 
there is something wrong
with this country 
morning  inspector 
you re at it early 
is something wrong 
you don t look so good  sir 
 beeps 
i wanna ask a question  dominic 
i don t care if you answer me or not 
i just wanna say this aloud 
but i need to know that this question
will not leave this office 
yeah  of course  inspector  but   
because of the terrorist 
no 
so  what is it  chief  what s going on 
the question i want to ask
is about st  mary s
and three waters 
the question that s kept me up
for the last 24 hours 
the question i have to ask  is 
what if the worst 
the most horrifying biological attack
in this country s history
was not the work of religious extremists 
i don t understand  we know it was 
they were caught  they confessed 
and they were executed  i know 
and maybe that s really what happened 
but i see this chain of events   
these coincidences  and i have to ask 
what if that isn t what happened 
what if someone else unleashed that virus 
what if someone else
killed all those people 
would you really wanna know who it was 
sure 
even if it was someone
working for this government 
that s my question 
if our own government was responsible
for what happened at st  mary s
and three waters   
if our own government was responsible
for the deaths of almost 100 000 people 
would you really wanna know 
 man 1  this has to be the bloody
coldest march in years 
 woman  keep talking like that 
we ll lose our party status 
 man 2 
they re a pack of lying hypocrites 
 man 1  keep it down  will you 
based on random audio sweeps 
i ve projected that right now
80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive 
we re also showing a 12 percent increase
over last month s positive mention
in all four quadrants 
 sutler  mr  creedy 
  we re handling it as best we can 
arrests are as high as they ve been
since the reclamation 
i want more than arrests  i want results

 evey screams 
 gasping 
 man  do you know why you re here 
evey hammond 
please 
 man  you ve been formally charged
with three counts of murder 
the bombing of government property 
conspiracy to commit terrorism 
treason and sedition  the penalty
for which is death by firing squad 
you have one chance 
and only one chance  to save your life 
you must tell us the identity
or whereabouts
of code name v 
if your information leads to his capture 
you will be released
from this facility immediately 
do you understand what i m telling you 
you can return to your life  miss hammond 
all you have to do is cooperate 
process her 
 sobbing 
 evey crying 
 screaming  sobbing 
 door opens 
 squeaking 
 rustling 
 woman s voice 
i know there s no way i can convince you
this is not one of their tricks 
but i don t care 
i am me 
my name is valerie 
i don t think i ll live much longer 
i wanted to tell someone about my life 
this is the only autobiography
that i will ever write and  god 
i m writing it on toilet paper 
i was born in nottingham in 1985 
i don t remember much
of those early years
but i do remember the rain 
my grandmother owned a farm
in tottle brook
and she used to tell me
that god was in the rain 
i passed my 11 plus
and went to girls  grammar 
it was at school
that i met my first girlfriend 
her name was sarah 
it was her wrists 
they were beautiful 
i thought we would
love each other forever 
i remember our teacher telling us
that it was an adolescent phase
that people outgrew 
sarah did 
i didn t 
in 2002  i fell in love
with a girl named christina 
that year i came out to my parents 
 shouting indistinctly 
 valerie  i couldn t have done it
without chris holding my hand 
my father wouldn t look at me 
he told me to go and never come back 
 woman crying 
 valerie  my mother said nothing 
but i d only told them the truth 
was that so selfish 
our integrity sells for so little 
but it is all we really have 
it is the very last inch of us 
but within that inch 
we are free 
 man 
it ends whenever you want it to 
  just tell us where he is 
  i don t know 
 valerie  i d always known
what i wanted to do with my life
and in 2015  i starred in my first film 
the salt flats 
it was the most important role of my life 
not because of my career 
but because that was how i met ruth 
the first time we kissed 
i knew i never wanted to kiss
any other lips but hers again 
we moved to a small flat
in london together 
she grew scarlet carsons for me
in our window box
and our place always smelt of roses 
those were the best years of my life 
but america s war grew worse and worse
and eventually came to london 
the bill proposed by the undersecretary
for defense  adam sutler
to close the remaining tube stations
passed with near universal   
 valerie 
after that  there were no roses anymore 
not for anyone 
 man  you won t last much longer 
you re gonna die here 
why protect someone
who doesn t give a shit about you 
 door slams  locks 
 valerie  i remember how the meaning
of words began to change 
how unfamiliar words like  collateral 
and  rendition  became frightening 
while things like  norsefire  and the
 articles of allegiance  became powerful 
i remember how  different 
became dangerous 
i still don t understand it 
why they hate us so much 
 grunts 
 valerie  they took ruth
while she was out buying food 
i ve never cried so hard in my life 
it wasn t long till they came for me 
it seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place 
but for three years 
i had roses and apologized to no one 
i shall die here 
every inch of me shall perish 
every inch
but one 
an inch 
it is small  and it is fragile
and it is the only thing
in the world worth having 
we must never lose it or give it away 
we must never let them take it from us 
i hope that  whoever you are 
you escape this place 
i hope that the world turns
and that things get better 
but what i hope most of all
is that you understand what i mean
when i tell you that
even though i do not know you
and even though
i may never meet you 
laugh with you  cry with you 
or kiss you   
i love you 
with all my heart 
i love you 
valerie 
 man  i m instructed to inform you
that you have been convicted
by special tribunal
and that unless you are ready
to offer your cooperation 
you are to be executed 
do you understand what i m telling you 
  yes 
  are you ready to cooperate 
  no 
  very well 
escort miss hammond back to her cell 
arrange a detail of six men
and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her 
 man  it s time 
i m ready 
 man  look  all they want
is one little piece of information 
just give them something  anything 
thank you 
but i d rather die
behind the chemical sheds 
 man  then you have no fear anymore 
you re completely free 
what 
hello  evey 
you 
  it was you 
  yeah 
that wasn t real 
  is gordon    
  i m sorry  but mr  deitrich s dead 
i thought they d arrest him
but when they found a koran
in his house  they had him executed 
oh  god 
  fortunately  i got to you before they did 
  you got to me 
you did this to me 
you cut my hair 
you tortured me 
you tortured me 
why 
 v  you said you wanted to live without
fear  i wish there d been an easier way
  but there wasn t 
  oh  my god 
i know you may never forgive me
but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me 
every day  i saw in myself
everything you see in me now 
every day  i wanted to end it 
but each time you refused to give in 
i knew i couldn t 
you re sick  you re evil 
you could have ended it 
you could have given in  but you didn t 
  why 
  leave me alone  i hate you 
 v  that s it  see  at first 
i thought it was hate too 
hate was all i knew 
it built my world  imprisoned me 
taught me how to eat 
how to drink  how to breathe 
i thought i d die
with all the hate in my veins 
but then something happened 
it happened to me
just as it happened to you 
shut up  i don t want to hear
your lies 
 v  your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth 
yes  i created a lie 
but because you believed it 
you found something true about yourself 
  no 
  what was true in that cell is true now 
what you felt in there
has nothing to do with me 
i can t feel anything anymore 
don t run from it  evey 
you ve been running all your life 
 gasping 
i can t  can t breathe 
asthma  when i was little   
listen to me  evey 
this may be the most important moment
of your life  commit to it 
 sobbing 
they took your parents from you 
they took your brother from you 
they put you in a cell
and took everything they could take 
except your life 
and you believed that was all
there was  didn t you 
the only thing you had left
was your life  but it wasn t 
  oh  please 
  you found something else 
in that cell  you found something
that mattered more to you than life 
when they threatened to kill you
unless you gave them what they wanted 
you told them you d rather die 
you faced your death  evey 
you were calm  you were still 
try to feel now what you felt then 
oh  god 
i felt 
 v  yes 
i m dizzy 
i need air 
please  i need to be outside 
 v  there s a lift 
it ll take us to the roof 
 thunder rumbling 
god is in the rain 
 crying 
 shouts 
 cat power s  i found a reason  playing 
v 
i m leaving 
there are 872 songs in here 
i ve listened to them all 
but i ve never danced to any of them 
  did you hear me 
  yes 
i can t stay here 
 v  i know 
well  you won t find
any more locked doors here 
i thought about keeping this
but it didn t seem right 
knowing you wrote it 
i didn t 
may i show you something before you go 
  she was real 
  yes 
she s beautiful 
  did you know her 
  no 
she wrote the letter
just before she died 
and i delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me 
then it really happened  didn t it 
  yes 
  you were in the cell next to her 
and that s what this is all about 
you re getting back at them
for what they did to her 
  and to you 
  what was done to me created me 
it s a basic principle of the universe
that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction 
is that how you see it 
  like an equation 
  what was done to me was monstrous 
and they created a monster 
  do you know where you ll go 
  no 
that would have scared me before
but i suppose i should thank you 
well 
thank you 
goodbye 
evey   
may i ask you for something 
if i had one wish  i would wish
to see you again  if only once
before the 5th 
  all right 
  thank you 
 sobbing 
 heyer  chancellor  i know no one
seems to want to discuss this
but if we re to be prepared
for any eventuality 
then it can t be ignored any longer 
the red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists 
now  it concludes that
the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use
would be an airborne attack 
a separate report has been filed
suggesting a train  despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding parliament
have been sealed shut 
who filed that report 
 heyer  chief inspector finch 
do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion  mr  finch 
no  sir  just a feeling 
if i am sure of anything  inspector 
it is that this government won t survive
if it is to be subject to your feelings 
mr  dascomb  what we need right now
is a clear message
to the people of this country 
this message must be read
in every newspaper 
heard on every radio 
seen on every television 
this message must resound
throughout the entire interlink 
i want this country to realize
that we stand on the edge of oblivion 
i want every man  woman and child to
understand how close we are to chaos 
i want everyone
to remember why they need us 
in the former united states  civil war
continues to devastate the midwest 
scientists attribute this water shortage
to the lack of rainfall the last two years 
ministry officials expect
water coupon prices to rise 
police have arrested nine suspects 
can you believe this shit 
been going on all summer 
outside the quarantine zone  a new
airborne pathogen has killed 27 people 
authorities uncovered new evidence
linking the terrorist organization called v
to the st  mary s viral attack

 device beeps 
 dominic  my friend inside the finger
came up with something 
there were three men 
covert intel 
original black baggers 
all under creedy 
 finch  alan percy  robert keyes 
william rookwood 
the day after the st  mary s outbreak 
percy gives his beretta a blowjob 
keyes dies in a fire   
rookwood goes missing 
bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach 
rookwood 
how do i know that name 
 dominic  holy shit  he must have had
a hidden trip on his file at the finger 
but how d he know it was you 
what do we do 
i m a cop  i have to know 
i came when they opened it 
it gave me the collywobbles 
still does 
that s close enough  inspector 
 device beeps 
we re not wired 
i m sorry  but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution 
  you have information for us 
  no  you already have the information 
all the names and dates
are inside your head 
what you want 
what you really need  is a story 
a story can be true or false 
i leave such judgments to you 
inspector 
our story begins 
as these stories often do 
with a young  up and coming politician 
he s a deeply religious man
and a member of the conservative party 
he s completely single minded and
has no regard for the political process 
the more power he attains 
the more obvious his zealotry
and the more aggressive
his supporters become 
eventually  his party launches a special
project in the name of national security 
at first it s believed to be a search
for biological weapons
and it s pursued without regard
to its cost 
however  the true goal
of this project is power 
complete and total hegemonic domination 
the project  however  ends violently 
but the efforts of those involved
are not in vain
for a new ability to wage war is born
from the blood of one of the victims 
imagine a virus 
the most terrifying virus you can
and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure 
but if your ultimate goal is power 
how best to use such a weapon 
well  it s at this point in our story
that along comes a spider 
a man seemingly without a conscience
for whom the ends
always justify the means 
and it s he who suggests that their target
should not be an enemy of the country 
but rather  the country itself 
three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack 
a school  a tube station
and a water treatment plant 
several hundred die
within the first few weeks 
three waters has  in fact 
been contaminated 
authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread 
   sent a wave of destruction
through the underground 
 rookwood  fueled by the media 
fear and panic spread quickly 
fracturing and dividing
the country until  at last 
the true goal comes into view 
before the st  mary s crises 
no one would ve predicted the results
of the election that year  no one 
and then not long after the election 
io and behold  a miracle 
some believed it was the work
of god himself 
but it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members
that made them all obscenely rich 
a year later  several extremists are tried 
found guilty and executed 
while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims 
but the end result 
the true genius of the plan  was the fear 
fear became the ultimate tool
of this government 
through it  our politician
was ultimately appointed
to the newly created position
of high chancellor 
the rest  as they say  is history 
  can you prove any of this 
  why do you think i m still alive 
all right  we d like to take you into
protective custody  mr  rookwood 
i m sure you would 
but if you want that recording 
you ll do what i tell you to do 
put creedy under 24 hour surveillance 
when i feel safe he can t pick his nose
without you knowing 
i ll contact you again 
till then  cheerio 
 finch  rookwood   
why didn t you come forward before 
what were you waiting for 
well  for you  inspector 
i needed you 
 v  shh  shh  shh 
 beethoven s  symphony no  5 
playing over speaker 
what s he doing in the dark there 
creepy creedy 
not sure i wanna know 
sutler can no longer trust you 
can he  mr  creedy 
and we both know why 
after i destroy parliament 
his only chance will be to offer them
someone else  some other piece of meat 
and who will that be 
you  mr  creedy 
a man as smart as you
has probably considered this 
a man as smart as you
probably has a plan 
that plan is the reason
sutler no longer trusts you 
it s the reason why
you re being watched right now 
why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house
  and a tap on every phone 
  bollocks 
oh  a man as smart as you  i think 
knows otherwise 
  what do you want 
  sutler 
come  now  mr  creedy 
you knew this was coming 
you knew that one day  it d be you or him 
that s why sutler s been kept
underground for security purposes 
that s why there are several
of your men close to sutler 
men that can be counted on 
all you have to do is say the word 
  what do i get out of this deal 
  me 
if you accept 
put an x on your front door 
why should i trust you 
because it s the only way
you re ever going to stop me 
 upbeat music playing on tv 
 dantes  it is not my sword  mondego 
but your past that disarmed you 
may we come up 
you find your own tree 
 dominic  we got creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks 
still no word  what s he waiting for 
 phone ringing 
yeah  inspector  it s for you 
  yeah 
 man  is that chief inspector finch 
  it is 
  this is captain clark
of the 137th ward at southend 
  we found him 
  found who 
william rookwood 
the one you re looking for 
i saw your report a couple weeks back 
thought i d run it through our john does 
i hooked him  perfect dental match 
a floater  fishermen picked him up 
no id  never solved  till now  that is 
  william rookwood is dead 
  i d say so  twenty years now 
goddamn it 
that son of a bitch sat there
and spoon fed me that bullshit 
and i ate it up 
so  what do we do now  inspector 
we do what we should
have been doing 
we find him 
 spray can hissing 
 spray can rattling 
every day  gentlemen 
every day that brings us closer
to november 
every day that man remains free
is one more failure 
three hundred and forty seven days 
gentlemen 
three hundred and forty seven failures 
chancellor  we do not have
the adequate force   
we are being buried beneath the avalanche
of your inadequacies  mr  creedy 
 doorbell rings 
i ll get it 
  eric finch 
  yeah 
bloody hell 
   phones ringing 
  how many went out 
so far we count eight boxcars 
  several hundred thousand  at least 
  christ 
i want anyone caught
with one of those masks arrested 
 man  give me the money 
give me the fucking money 
we re under siege here 
the whole city s gone mad 
  this is exactly what he wants 
  what 
   man  anarchy in the uk 
  chaos 
mr  creedy  i am holding you
personally responsible for this situation 
 finch  the problem is that he knows us
better than we know ourselves 
that s why i went to larkhill last night 
  that s outside quarantine 
  i had to see it 
there wasn t much left 
but when i was there  it was strange 
i suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected 
like i could see the whole thing 
one long chain of events that stretched
all the way back before larkhill 
i felt like i could see everything
that had happened   
and everything that was going to happen 
 fingerman  hey  you 
it was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me   
and i realized that
we were all a part of it   
and all trapped by it 
 bell tolls 
so do you know what s gonna happen 
no  it was a feeling 
but i can guess 
with so much chaos 
someone will do something stupid 
and when they do 
things will turn nasty 
 inaudible 
rioters were arrested in brixton 
and then sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do 
at which point 
all v needs to do is keep his word 
and then 
 clock beeps 
 richard hawley s  long black train 
playing on radio 
tonight s your big night 
you ready for it 
are we ready for it 
 julie london s  cry me a river 
playing on jukebox 
i missed this song 
 v  i didn t think you d come 
  i said i would 
  ah 
you look well 
thank you 
 v  may i inquire as to how
you ve avoided detection 
a fake id works better
than a guy fawkes mask 
 v chuckles 
i must confess  every time
i heard a siren  i worried about you 
i worried about myself for a while 
but then  one day  i was at a market
and a friend  someone i had worked
with at the btn  got in line behind me 
i was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money  i dropped it 
my friend picked it up
and handed it to me 
she looked at me right in the eyes   
didn t recognize me 
whatever you did to me worked better
than i d have imagined 
i have a gift for you  evey 
but before i give it to you 
i d like to ask you something 
would you dance with me 
now  on the eve of your revolution 
 v  oh  a revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having 
i d love to 
tonight  i will speak directly
to these people
and make the situation
perfectly clear to them 
the security of this nation depends
on complete and total compliance 
tonight  any protester 
any instigator or agitator
will be made example of 
 clearing throat 
chancellor  there is a contingency
that has not been addressed 
and what is that  mr  dascomb 
  should the terrorist succeed   
  he won t 
i understand that it is highly unlikely 
but if he does   
if he does  and something happens
to that building 
the only thing that will change 
the only difference it will make
is that tomorrow morning 
instead of a newspaper 
i will be reading
mr  creedy s resignation 
 antony and the johnsons   bird gerhl 
playing on jukebox 
you ve been busy 
they re very scared right now 
i heard sutler s going to make
a public statement tonight 
hmm  it s nearly time 
the masks were ingenious 
it was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere 
conceal me what i am  and be my aid
for such disguise as haply
shall become the form of my intent 
   evey  twelfth night 
  viola 
  i don t understand 
  what 
how you can be one of the most
important things that s happened to me
and yet i know
almost nothing about you 
i don t know where you were born 
who your parents were 
if you had any brothers or sisters 
i don t even know
what you really look like 
evey  please 
there is a face beneath this mask 
but it s not me 
i m no more that face than i am
the muscles beneath it
or the bones beneath them 
i understand 
thank you 
there isn t much time 
i have something i must give you 
i went by parliament 
never seen anything like it 
tanks  anti aircraft  infantry 
makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight 
but if they do 
what do you think will happen 
what usually happens
when people without guns
stand up to people with guns 
pull over here 
we ve searched these tunnels for weeks 
you think you re gonna find him now 
inspector 
it s all gone wrong  hasn t it 
the underground 
i thought they closed this all down 
they did 
it took nearly 10 years to
clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own 
let me show you 
  these tracks lead to parliament 
  yes 
then it s really going to happen 
isn t it 
 v  it will if you want it to 
  what 
  this is my gift to you  evey 
everything that i have  my home 
my books  the gallery  this train 
i m leaving to you to do with
what you will 
is this another trick  v 
 v  no  no more tricks  no more lies 
only truth 
and the truth is  you made me
understand that i was wrong 
that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make 
  why 
  because this world 
the world that i m a part of and
that i helped shape  will end tonight 
and tomorrow 
a different world will begin
that different people will shape 
and this choice belongs to them 
where are you going 
the time has come for me
to meet my maker
and to repay him in kind
for all that he s done 
v  wait 
please  you don t have to do this 
you could let it go 
we could leave here together 
no  you were right about what i am 
i have no tree waiting for me 
all i want  all i deserve 
is at the end of that tunnel 
that s not true 
i can t 
my fellow englishmen   
tonight  our country 
that which we stand for
and all that we hold dear 
faces a grave and terrible threat 
 soldier  the area s clean  sir 
this violent and unparalleled assault
to our security
will not go undefended   
where is he 
   or unpunished 
 v  penny for the guy 
our enemy is an insidious one 
seeking to divide us
and destroy the very foundation
of our great nation 
 v  i have kept my side of the bargain 
but have you kept yours 
bring him down 
tonight we must remain steadfast 
we must remain determined 
but most of all  we must remain united 
those caught tonight
in violation of curfew
will be considered in league
with our enemy
and prosecuted as a terrorist
without leniency or exception 
i want to see his face 
tonight  i give you my most solemn vow
thatjustice will be swift 
it will be righteous 
and it will be without mercy 
oh  god  no 
 v  at last  we finally meet 
 sobbing 
i have something for you  chancellor 
a farewell gift 
for all the things you ve done 
for the things you might have done 
and for the only thing you have left 
goodbye  chancellor 
mr  creedy 
disgusting 
 gunshot echoes 
now that s done with 
it s time to have a look at your face 
take off your mask 
 v  no 
 men grunting 
defiant to the end  huh 
you won t cry like him  will you 
you re not afraid of death 
you re like me 
the only thing you and i
have in common  mr  creedy 
is we re both about to die 
how do you imagine that s gonna happen 
with my hands around your neck 
bollocks 
what are you gonna do  huh 
we ve swept this place 
you ve got nothing 
nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks 
we have guns 
no  you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty 
i m no longer standing  because if i am 
you ll all be dead before you ve reloaded 
that s impossible 
kill him 
 breathing heavily 
 v  my turn 
 yells 
 screams 
die  die 
why won t you die 
   gun clicks 
  why won t you die 
beneath this mask 
there is more than flesh 
beneath this mask there is an idea 
mr  creedy 
and ideas are bulletproof 
 bone snaps 
 panting 
 grunting 
 helicopter whirring 
this is perimeter one 
whitehall is secure  over 
 man  this is general ackroyd 
keep communication tight 
i won t have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is 
v 
 v gasping 
oh  god  we have to stop your bleeding 
please  don t 
i m finished and glad of it 
don t say that 
i told you  only truth 
for 20 years  i sought only this day 
nothing else existed   
until i saw you 
then everything changed 
i fell in love with you  evey   
like i no longer believed i could 
v  i don t want you to die 
that s the most beautiful thing
you could have ever given me 
v

 sobbing

then it s over 
almost 
stop  get your hand off that lever 
no 
 lieutenant  enemy is approaching fast 
requesting orders 
  what shall we do 
  no response from command 
or from party leader creedy 
or from the high chancellor 
why are you doing this 
  because he was right 
  about what 
that this country needs more than
a building right now  it needs hope 
bloody hell  stand down  stand down 
jesus bloody christ
