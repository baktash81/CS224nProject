i know of no reason
why the gunpowder treason
should ever be forgot
but what of the man
i know his name was guy fawkes
and i know in 1605 he attempted
to blow up the houses of parliament
but who was he really
what was he like
dogs barking
woman we are told to remember
the idea and not the man
because a man can fail
he can be caught
he can be killed and forgotten
but 400 years later
an idea can still change the world
i have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas
ive seen people kill
in the name of them
crowd yelling
and die defending them
but you cannot kiss an idea
cannot touch it or hold it
ideas do not bleed
they do not feel pain
they do not love
and it is not an idea that i miss
it is a man
a man that made me remember
the 5th of november
a man that i will never forget
so i read that the former united states
is so desperate for medical supplies
that they have allegedly sent several
containers filled with wheat and tobacco
a gesture they said of goodwill
you wanna know what i think
well youre listening to my show
so i will assume you do
its high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them
i think its payback time for a tea party
they threw for us a few hundred years ago
i say we go down to those docks tonight
and dump that crap
where everything from the ulcered sphincter
of asserica belongs
whos with me whos bloody with me
tv audience applauding
did you like that
usa ulcered sphincter of asserica
i mean what else can you say
here was a country that had everything
absolutely everything
and now 20 years later is what
the worlds biggest leper colony why
godlessness
let me say that again
godlessness
it wasnt the war they started
it wasnt the plague they created
it was judgment
no one escapes their past
no one escapes judgment
you think hes not up there
you think hes not watching over
this country
how else can you explain it
he tested us but we came through
we did what we had to do
islington enfield
i was there i saw it all
immigrants muslims
homosexuals terrorists
diseaseridden degenerates
they had to go
strength through unity
unity through faith
i am a godfearing englishman
and im goddamn proud of it
thats quite enough of that
thank you very much
oh shit
woman over speaker
a yellowcoded curfew is now in effect
any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest
this is for your protection
a yellowcoded curfew

real sick bad case of the blues
you can feel them
dont touch me
look willy kittys got claws
she just threatened us

dont you
it means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion
and you get to swallow it
oh god youre fingermen
shes getting the picture
no please i didnt know im sorry
not yet youre not but you will be
by sunup if youre not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of london
then youll certainly be the sorest
oh god no please dont do this
ill go home

what do you think lads
spare the rod spoil the child
help me someone help
v the multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him
fingerman what the hell
willy bugger off
disdaining fortune
with his brandishd steel
which smoked with bloody execution
fingerman
were fingermen pal
v aha
yells
whimpering
jesus christ mercy
we are oft to blame in this
tis too much proved
that with devotions visage
and pious action
we do sugar oer the devil himself
whats that mean
spare the rod
truncheon drops
i can assure you i mean you no harm
who are you
who
who is but the form
following the function of what
and what i am is a man in a mask
oh i can see that
of course you can
im not questioning your powers
of observation
im merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is
oh right
but on this most auspicious of nights
permit me then in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet
to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona
voilà
in view a humble
vaudevillian veteran
cast vicariously as both victim
and villain by the vicissitudes of fate
this visage
no mere veneer of vanity
is a vestige of the vox populi
now vacant vanished
however this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified
and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice
and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition
the only verdict is vengeance
a vendetta
held as a votive not in vain
for the value and veracity of such
shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous
v chuckles
verily this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose
so let me simply add that its
my very good honor to meet you
and you may call me v
are you like a crazy person
i am quite sure they will say so
but to whom might i ask
am i speaking
im evey
evey
evey of course you are
what does that mean
it means that i like god
do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence
are you hurt
no im fine
thanks to you
oh i merely played my part
but tell me do you enjoy music evey
i suppose
you see im a musician of sorts
and on my way to give
a very special performance
what kind of musician
percussion instruments are my speciality
but tonight i intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event
and would be honored
if you could join me
i dont think so
i should be getting home
i promise you itll be like
nothing youve ever seen
and afterwards
youll return home safely
all right
evey its beautiful up here
v a more perfect stage
could not be asked for
i dont see any instruments
your powers of observation
continue to serve you well
but wait it is to madame justice
that i dedicate this concerto
in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts
and in recognition of the impostor
that stands in her stead
tell me do you know
what day it is evey
um
november the 4th
not anymore
bells chiming
remember remember
the 5th of november
the gunpowder treason and plot
i know of no reason
why the gunpowder treason
should ever be forgot
first the overture
yes
yes the strings
listen carefully can you hear it
now the brass
i can hear it
tchaikovskys 1812 overture
playing over speakers
look outside mommy
theyre playing music
how do you do that
wait
here comes the crescendo
v laughing
how beautiful is it not
gentlemen you have had four hours
you had better have results mr creedy
the bailey area is quarantined
all significant witnesses
have been detained
good mr etheridge
a recording device was found wired into
the central emergencybroadcast system
the dcd was tchaikovskys
1812 overture
add it to the blacklist
i never want to hear that music again
yes sir
we also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance
indicating a high percentage
of conversation about the explosion
mr dascomb
what are we doing about that
were calling it
an emergency demolition
we have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the interlink
experts have been lined up to testify
against the baileys structural integrity
i want prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings
and how we must avoid clinging
to the edifice of a decadent past
he should conclude that the new bailey
will become the symbol of our time
and the future
that our conviction has rewarded us
mr heyer
our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist
though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible
we also managed to get a picture of
the girl that creedys men were detaining
who is she mr finch
not sure yet sir
but were working on several leads
anything else
we located the fireworks launch
and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites
unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication
these devices were homemade
with overthecounter chemicals
making them very difficult to trace
whoever he is chancellor
hes very good
spare us your professional annotations
mr finch they are irrelevant
apologies chancellor
gentlemen this is a test
moments such as these
are matters of faith
to fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe
everything we have fought for
doubt will plunge this country back
into chaos and i will not let that happen
gentlemen i want this
terrorist found
and i want him to understand
what terror really means
england prevails
all england prevails
tv theme music plays
woman you think people will buy this
dascomb why not
this is the btn
our job is to report the news
not fabricate it
thats the governments job
on the lighter side of things
seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the old bailey
wanted to give the old girl a grand
albeit improvised sendoff
although the demolition had been
planned for some time
the music and the fireworks were
according to the crew chief
definitely not on the schedule
man on tv well be right back
do you believe that load of bollocks
i mean there was no bloody demolition
i saw it the whole thing
did you see it
no last night i was
yeah thats right you went
to see daddy deitrich didnt you
evey there you are
you are still working for me
sorry patricia
i need two espressos and three coffees
and deitrich is ready for his tea
man i dont get it
why does he wear a guy fawkes mask
and then blow up the bailey
didnt fawkes try to blow up parliament
its not too late
hes still got another 16 hours
maybe hes just getting started
phone ringing
yeah
okay a lead on the girl
man look dont get me wrong
i love it a cow getting crucified
its hysterical
but youll never get it approved
youve got to rewrite it okay gotta go
i dont recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman
mr deitrich
gordon please
i dont need mister to make
this body feel any older
gordon
i was on my way last night
but there were fingermen
and i got scared and went home
sadly after last night
i think our curfew will only get worse
gotcha
hey fred
fred all that been xrayed
nope theyre filled with bombs
well wait till commercials
to set them off okay
i cant believe you watch that shit
fred what
laser lass is banging
indistinct chatter
whats all that
not sure they just arrived
marked for stage 3
must be prothero
i wish someone had the balls to tell that
brat this station aint his playground
what the hell is this
just put them over there
until i can figure out what theyre for
this looks serious
her parents were political activists

finch juvenile reclamation project

beeping
alarm wailing

the rest of you follow me
man over speaker attention attention

will all personnel evacuate the building
what the hells going on
its jammed
break it down
dominic
police out of the way

damn it
ill tell you what i know
ill tell you what i know
ill tell you what i know
england prevails
clear the halls
officer sir
help storm help
man dont touch it
dad whats wrong with the telly
v good evening london
allow me first to apologize
thats the emergency channel
i do like many of you appreciate
the comforts of the everyday routine
the security of the familiar
the tranquility of repetition
bloody hell
i enjoy them as much as any bloke
but in the spirit of commemoration
whos that mum
shh
whereby important events
of the past
usually associated
with someones death
or the end of some awful
bloody struggle
are celebrated with a nice holiday
i thought we could mark
this november the 5th
a day that is sadly
no longer remembered
by taking time out of our daily lives
to sit down and have a little chat
there are of course
those who do not want us to speak
let me think let me think
even now orders are being shouted
into telephones
and men with guns
will soon be on their way
its chancellor sutler
damn it
why because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation
words will always retain their power
words offer the means to meaning
and for those who will listen
the enunciation of truth
and the truth is
there is something terribly wrong
with this country isnt there
you designed it you wanted it foolproof
you said every television in london
cruelty and injustice
intolerance and oppression
and where once
you had the freedom to object
to think and speak as you saw fit
you now have censors and surveillance
coercing your conformity
and soliciting submission
cameras we need cameras
how did this happen
whos to blame
certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others
and they will be held accountable
but again truth be told
if youre looking for the guilty
you need only look into a mirror
i know why you did it
i know you were afraid
who wouldnt be war terror disease
there were a myriad of problems
which conspired
to corrupt your reason
and rob you of your common sense
fear got the best of you
and in your panic you turned to
the now high chancellor adam sutler
he promised you order
he promised you peace
and all he demanded in return
was your silent obedient consent
inspector theyre almost through
last night i sought to end that silence
last night i destroyed the old bailey
to remind this country
of what it has forgotten
more than 400 years ago a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of november
forever in our memory
his hope was to remind the world
that fairness justice and freedom
are more than words
they are perspectives
so if youve seen nothing
if the crimes of this government
remain unknown to you
then i would suggest that you allow
the 5th of november to pass unmarked
but if you see what i see
if you feel as i feel
and if you would seek as i seek
then i ask you to stand beside me
one year from tonight
outside the gates of parliament
and together we shall give them
a 5th of november
that shall never ever be forgot
kerosene fog

i must say that i am rather astonished
by the response time of londons finest
i hadnt expected you to be
quite so johnnyonthespot
we were here before you even started
bad luck chummy
oh i dont know about that
aah
were interrupting your regular program
to bring you this terrifying report
of a terrorist takeover of jordan tower
which ended only moments ago
a psychotic terrorist
identified only as the letter v
attacked the control booth with
highpowered explosives and weapons
that he used against unarmed civilians
in order to broadcast a message of hate
weve just received this footage
of a daring police raid
officer on tv stop
stop stay where you are or well shoot
stay where you are
now this is only an initial report
but at this time its believed
that during this heroic raid
the terrorist was shot and killed
bollocks
again from what weve been told
by authorities the danger is now over
the terrorist is dead
finch
right there whats he thinking
is he considering leaving her
after she just saved him
hes a terrorist you cant expect him
to act like you or me
some part of hims human
and for better or worse
shes stuck with him
julie londons cry me a river
playing nearby
you scared me
my apologies
are you feeling all right
yes thank you
what is this place
its my home
i call it the shadow gallery
its beautiful
where did you get all this stuff
oh here and there
much of it from the vaults of
the ministry of objectionable materials
you stole them
heavens no
stealing implies ownership
you cant steal from the censor
i merely reclaimed them
god if they ever find this place
i suspect if they do a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries
evey
you mean after what youve done
god what have i done
i maced that detective
why did i do that
you did what you thought was right
no i shouldnt have done that
i must have been out of my mind
is that what you really think
or what theyd want you to think
i think i should go
may i ask where
home i have to go home
theyre looking for you
if they know where you work
they know where you live
i have friends i could stay with them
im afraid that wont work either
you have to understand evey
i didnt want this for either of us
but i couldnt see any other way
you were unconscious
and i had to make a decision
if i had left you there right now youd be
in one of creedys interrogation cells
theyd imprison you torture you
and in all probability kill you
in the pursuit of finding me
after what you did
i couldnt let that happen
so i picked you up and carried you
to the only place i knew youd be safe
here to my home
i wont tell anyone i swear
you know you can trust me
im sorry but i cant take that risk
but i dont even know where this is
v you know its underground
you know the color of the stone
thatd be enough for a clever man
are you saying that i have to stay here
only until im done after the 5th
i no longer think itll matter
you mean a year from now
i have to stay here for a year
sorry evey
i didnt know what else to do
you shouldve left me alone
why didnt you just leave me alone
v sighs
door slams
anything else on the parents
yeah it aint good
they were interned at belmarsh
oh no

stan getzs the girl from ipanema
playing on jukebox

and i want you to know i am grateful
your hands
v yes
v humming
there thats better
i hope i didnt put you off
your appetite
no please its just are you all right
yes yes yes im fine
can i ask what happened
v there was a fire a long time ago
ancient history for some
not really very good
table conversation
now would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg
yes thank you im starving actually
have a seat
mmm
its delicious
good
god i havent had real butter
since i was a little girl
where did you get it
v a government supply train
on its way to chancellor sutler

yes
youre insane
v i dare do all that may become a man
who dares more is none
macbeth
very good
my mum she used to
read all his plays to me
and ever since
ive always wanted to act
be in plays movies
when i was 9 i played viola
in twelfth night mum was very proud
v where is your mother now
shes dead
v im sorry
can i ask about
what you said on the telly
did you mean it
every word
you really think blowing up parliaments
going to make this country a better place
v theres no certainty
only opportunity
you can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up
creedyll blackbag
every one of them
v people should not be afraid
of their governments
governments should be afraid
of their people
and youll make that happen
by blowing up a building
v the building is a symbol
as is the act of destroying it
symbols are given power by people
alone a symbol is meaningless
but with enough people
blowing up a building
can change the world
i wish i believed that was possible
every time ive seen this world change
its always been for the worse
ill tell you what i know
i know this is not a man
tv audience applauding
prothero what is he
prothero on tv
a man does not wear a mask
what is he
a man does not threaten civilians
hes what every gutless
freedomhating terrorist is
a goddamn coward
phone ringing
there will be no negotiation
when i arrive in the morning
the paddy will be gone
im looking at the tape right now
and he has no idea how to light me
my nose looks like big fucking ben
listen to me you bleeding sod
england prevails because i say it does
so does every lazy cunt on this show
and that includes you
find another dop
or find yourself another job
ill tell you what i wish
i wish id been there
i wish id had the chance
for a facetoface
just one chance thats all id need
this socalled v and his accomplice
evey hammond
neodemagogues
spouting their message of hate
a delusional and aberrant voice
delivering a terrorists ultimatum
an ultimatum that was met
with swift and surgically precise justice
no mercy
the moral ladies and gentlemen is
together
good guys win bad guys lose
and as always england prevails
holy christ jesus
good evening commander prothero
oh my god how did you get in here
dont worry ive made sure
our reunion wont be disturbed by
any pesky latenight phone calls
commander
stop why do you keep calling me that
that was your title remember
when we first met all those years ago
you wore a uniform in those days
you
it is you
the ghost of christmas past
phone ringing
yeah
dascomb finch its dascomb
dascomb
ive already called the chancellor
we have to get control of the situation
what situation
chancellor sutler agreed for obvious
reasons we have to keep this discreet
in the wrong light
the loss of the voice of london
could be devastating
to our credibility
perhaps a stroke
no no its too horrific
a quiet dignified death in his sleep
we got any eyes or ears on this
no camcos were cut
its the same mo as before
but we got an elevator log id
let me guess
shes in deep inspector
metal clanging
v
soaring music playing on tv
v chuckles
my fat metal friend
imitates choking noises
grunting
mondego
oh god i hope i didnt wake you
no i just thought you were fighting
i mean for real
v my favorite film
the count of monte cristo
with robert donat as edmond dantes
it is not my sword mondego
but your past that disarmed you
it gets me every time
never seen it
really
would you like to
does it have a happy ending
v as only celluloid can deliver
okay
put the sword away
forensics just wrapped
no prints no hair no fibers
the guy is like a ghost
you wont believe
what they found on prothero
drugs
couldve started his own hospital
interesting
why
did you know lewis prothero was
one of the richest men in the country
before he was the voice of london
drugs
legal ones
major stockholder
in viadoxic pharmaceutical
viadoxic and st marys
in less than a week coincidence
when youre at this as long as ive been
you stop believing in coincidence
may we come up
dantes you find your own tree
v you find your own tree
did you like it
yeah
but it made me feel sorry for mercedes
why
because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her
nationwide were devastated
as news of the most popular
wait whats this
most awarded stars
in the history of the btn
a man known to the entire nation
as the voice of london
passed away late last night
from apparent heart failure
shes lying
how do you know
she blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false
it came as no surprise
to those who knew him
that his body was at his office
where he often worked long hours
after everyone else had gone home
lewis you will be sorely missed
v yesterday i couldnt find my id
you didnt take it did you
v would you prefer a lie or the truth
did you have anything
to do with that
yes i killed him
you
oh god
youre upset
im upset
you just said you killed lewis prothero
i might have killed the fingermen that
attacked you i heard no objection
what
violence can be used for good
what are you talking about
justice
oh i see
v theres no court in this country
for men like prothero
and are you going to kill more people
v yes
take a look at this
protheros military record
what do you see
iraq kurdistan syria
before and after sudan
busy boy
but after all that
they put him in charge
of a detention facility at larkhill
well no good deed goes unpunished
you think theres a connection
between our boy and larkhill
it might explain the connection
between him and the hammond girl
problem is i cant find
any other record of it
larkhill larkhill i cannot recall
that particular facility inspector
youre welcome to review our records
weve been through your records
all it says is that there was
a detention facility at larkhill
approximately 10 miles
north of salisbury
well there you have it
this is a matter of some urgency major
we need to know if there was anything
different about this facility
im sorry inspector
i simply cannot recall
was there a specific profile
for those being sent there
usual undesirables i should think
but do you know
of course not i wasnt stationed there
do you know who was
i cannot recall specific names
but if you look through our records
your records are either deleted
omitted or missing
as head of the detention program
at that
before you go further let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then
now we dont have the problems
we had back then
we all did what we had to do
and in those circumstances
we did the best we could
thats all i have to say about that
you can do this
hi
ive been thinking
theres something
i want to ask you
but i dont think youll understand why
unless you know a few things about me
my father was a writer
you would have liked him
he used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth
while politicians used them
to cover the truth up
v a man after my own heart
he always told the best stories
until my brother died
that was when everything changed
my brother was one of the students
at st marys
after he died
my parents became political
they protested the war
and the reclamation
when sutler was appointed high chancellor
they were at the riot in leeds
i watched on the television
thinking i was going
to see my parents killed
i remember them arguing at night
mum wanted to leave the country
dad refused
he said if we ran away
they would win
win like
it was a game
door opens
evey quick hide
mummy
eveys mother evey
evey
i never saw them again
it was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth
im sorry evey
no im the one thats sorry
sorry im not a stronger person
sorry im not like my parents
i wish i was
but im not
i wish i wasnt afraid all the time
but i am
i know this world is screwed up
believe me i know it better than most
which is why i wanted to ask if there is
anything i can do to help make it right
please let me know
v if you wish
do you really think
youll find something here
worth a shot
one thing is true of all governments
the most reliable records are tax records
it appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost
probably during the reclamation
a lot of things went missing back then
but i found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault
everything weve got on larkhill
is in there
thanks this is a great help
evey speaking in latin
v by the power of truth i while living
have conquered the universe
personal motto
from faust
thats about trying
to cheat the devil isnt it
v it is and speaking of the devil
i was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing
of course
it appears that unforeseen circumstances
have accelerated my original plan
as a result im in need of someone
with some theatrical skill
ill do my best
v i believe you will
another doctor why does
a detention facility need so many doctors
i dont know but this is interesting
the highestpaid person
at the camp was a priest
really
yeah father lilliman
lilliman
was paid almost 200 grand a month
now that is interesting
looks like he was promoted
hes a bishop now
your grace
oh denis
has everything been arranged
yes
ive just received
your interlink itinerary
you should arrive in perth
in time for mass
youre most diligent denis
a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our lord but
your grace
it wasnt labor i was speaking of
it was rather my final remittance
that i was interested in
my last little joy
im sorry your grace
she has arrived but there was
some confusion at the agency
theyve sent a new girl who
im afraid is a little older than usual
older
oh dear shes not too old i trust
that is for your grace to decide
oh my
your grace
to think that i doubted your loveliness
for an instant
mea culpa my child
mea culpa
your grace we dont have much time
and i have to tell you something
a confession i love the confession game
tell me your sins
this isnt a game your grace
someones coming
i think he means to kill you
im sorry
im telling you this
because i want some kind
of protection or amnesty
i had nothing to do with the bailey
and made a mistake in the jordan tower
i think this should balance it out
what are you talking about
im evey hammond im
ive been the prisoner of the terrorist v
for the past several weeks
im telling you that any moment
hes going to come through that door
i unlocked the window in the room
where denis told me to get ready
laughing wonderful
its a game ive never played
what a delightful mind you have
i hope the rest of you
is just as interesting
no please you have to believe me
oh i do i do i do
let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs
stop it get off of me
seems ive captured
a dangerous terrorist
now how best to procure
her confession
oh
you little bitch
you fucking little whore
v reverend
oh my god
she wasnt lying it is you
im sorry
i had to
v evey
and thus i clothe my naked villainy
with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ
and seem a saint
when most i play the devil
oh please have mercy
oh not tonight bishop
not tonight
lilliman over speaker
dont do this i beg of you
well then
childrens hour at the abbey
v open your mouth
and stick out your tongue
what the
lillimani dont want to die
this is surveillance 109
we have an emergency
camera shutter clicks
run every name in that file
i want the whereabouts of all of them
tonight
yes sir
pucker up here comes the finger
yeah get going ill handle him
creedy
what are you doing here
several prominent party members
have been murdered chief inspector
this is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention
the chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement
itll be hard to investigate
if youre detaining all my witnesses
the security of information is paramount
in these volatile times
mistakes like jordan tower
can no longer be tolerated
if indeed
jordan tower was an accident
what does that mean
terrorist seems to have
a rather intimate understanding
of our system
the chancellor suspects
there might be an informer
are you saying im under surveillance
mr creedy
at this time it would behoove you
to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed
and concentrate on the concerns
of our present
you mean larkhill
major wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor
his loyalty is not in question
but mine is
your mother was irish wasnt she
terrible what st marys
did to ireland wasnt it
ive been a party member for 27 years
if i were you chief inspector
id find the terrorist
and id find him soon
doorbell rings
siren wailing nearby
please
evey good god
im sorry
i didnt know where else to go
yes well you better come inside
before someone sees you
cheers
i know every cops looking for me
i know its horrible of me
to put you in this situation
evey
you could be in terrible trouble
evey listen to me
if the government searched my house
you would be the least of my problems
you trusted me
it would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you
oh my god
thats god save the queen
my parents took me to it
when they hung it at gallery 12
i thought sutler had it destroyed
he believes he did
cost me more than this house
but no matter how bad i feel
it always cheers me up
what is that
its a copy of the koran 14th century
are you a muslim
no im in television
but why would you keep it
i dont have to be muslim to find
the images beautiful or poetry moving
is it worth it if they found that here
i told you
youd be the least of my worries
thank you gordon
thank you so much
its all right
this whole thing started the night
he blew up the old bailey
i was on my way here and
ah
yes
you see we are both fugitives
in our own way
but
youre wondering why
you were invited here to supper
in the first place
if my appetites were
for less conventional fare
unfortunately a man in my position
is expected to entertain
young and attractive ladies
like yourself
because in this world
if i were to invite who i desired
i would undoubtedly find myself
without a home let alone a tv show
im sorry
not as sorry as i am
the truth is after so many years
you begin to lose
more than just your appetite
you wear a mask for so long
you forget who you were beneath it
im sorry chief inspector
same basic toxicology as prothero
you could get these poisons
from any house in london
thanks delia
delia
any leads on finding this guy
nothing yet but theres something else
you can help me with
you started as a botanist didnt you
its its a scarlet carson
theyre believed to be extinct
he leaves them at the crime scenes
id appreciate it
if you could have a look at it
any information could be helpful
of course
phone ringing
excuse me
yeah
dominic i just finished
going through the file inspector
you better get back here
finch yeah okay
my god hes killed them all
dominic all but one
finch who is she
dominic not sure
shes clearly one of the people
in charge at larkhill
but after they shut it down
she disappeared for two years
till she applied for an overseas visa
which was denied
running away
probably because after that
all record of her seems to stop
she changed her name
thats what im guessing
i put a call in to the registry
but i havent heard back
its late or early
call them again i want that name
what are you sure about that
okay thank you
dr diana stanton changed her name
to delia surridge
the coroner
yeah
jesus i just saw her
wind whistling
its you isnt it
youve come to kill me
v yes
thank god
siren wailing
operator im sorry but i cant get
a response from that number
theres a problem with the connection
jesus christ
hes there
delia after what happened
after what they did
i thought about killing myself
but i knew that one day
youd come for me
i didnt know what
they were going to do
i swear to you
read my journal
what they did was only possible
because of you
oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war
he changed the entire course
of human history
is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope
i have not come
for what you hoped to do
ive come for what you did
its funny
i was given one of your roses today
i wasnt sure you were the terrorist
until i saw it
what a strange coincidence
that i should be given one today
there are no coincidences delia
only the illusion of coincidence
i have another rose
and this one is for you
youre going to kill me now
i killed you 10 minutes ago
while you slept
is there any pain
no
thank you
is it meaningless to apologize
v never
im so sorry
siren wailing
damn it
finch the terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it
he wanted us to know the story
or at least a part of it
am i to understand that you have read
this document inspector
yes sir
has anyone else read it
no sir
then let me make this perfectly clear
the contents of this document
are a matter of national security
constituting an assault on the character
of several important party members
as well as a blatant violation
of the articles of allegiance
as the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified
it could be an elaborate forgery
created by the terrorist
as easily as it could be the deranged
fantasy of a former party member
who resigned for psychological reasons
any discussion of this document
or its contents
will be regarded at the very least
as an act of sedition
if not a willful act of treason
is that understood mr finch
yes sir
you would do well inspector
to put it out of your mind
delia may 23rd
my first batch of subjects arrived today
and i have to admit that im very excited
this could be the dawn of a new age
nuclear power is meaningless
in a world where a virus
can kill an entire population
and leave its wealth intact
guard 1 stay together
guard 2 come on move
delia may 27th
commander prothero toured the lab
with a priest father lilliman
who i was told is here to monitor
for rules and rights violations
it made me nervous but the commander
assured me there wouldnt be a problem
june 2nd
i keep wondering if these people knew
how they might be helping their country
if they would act any differently
theyre so weak and pathetic
they never look you in the eye
i find myself hating them
august the 18th
of the original four dozen
over 75 percent are now deceased
no controllable pattern has yet emerged
september the 18th
there is one case that continues
to give me hope
he exhibits none of the immunesystem
pathologies the other subjects developed
ive discovered cellular anomalies in his
blood that ive been unable to categorize
the mutations seem to have triggered
the abnormal development
of basic kinesthesia and reflexes
the subject said
he could no longer remember
who he was or where he was from
whoever he was
he is now the key to our dream
and the hope that all of this
will not have been in vain
november the 5th
it started last night around midnight
the first explosions tore open
the entire medical section
all my work gone
i was trying to understand how
it couldve happened when i saw him
the man from room 5
he looked at me
not with eyes there were no eyes
but i know he was looking at me
because i felt it
yells
delia oh god
what have i done
sten getzs corcovado playing
bonjour mademoiselle
what is that youre making
we called it eggie in the basket
my mum made them
this is weird
what
the first morning i was with him
he made me eggs just like this
really
i swear
that is a strange coincidence
although theres an obvious explanation
there is
yes evey
i am v
at last you know the truth
youre stunned i know
hard to believe isnt it that beneath
this wrinkled wellfed exterior
there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for fawkesian masks
viva la revolución
that is not funny gordon
yeah i know
im useless without a studio audience
ive seen people go to jail
for less than that
of course he was right wasnt he
there is something wrong
with this country
morning inspector
youre at it early
is something wrong
you dont look so good sir
beeps
i wanna ask a question dominic
i dont care if you answer me or not
i just wanna say this aloud
but i need to know that this question
will not leave this office
yeah of course inspector but
because of the terrorist
no
so what is it chief whats going on
the question i want to ask
is about st marys
and three waters
the question thats kept me up
for the last 24 hours
the question i have to ask is
what if the worst
the most horrifying biological attack
in this countrys history
was not the work of religious extremists
i dont understand we know it was
they were caught they confessed
and they were executed i know
and maybe thats really what happened
but i see this chain of events
these coincidences and i have to ask
what if that isnt what happened
what if someone else unleashed that virus
what if someone else
killed all those people
would you really wanna know who it was
sure
even if it was someone
working for this government
thats my question
if our own government was responsible
for what happened at st marys
and three waters
if our own government was responsible
for the deaths of almost 100000 people
would you really wanna know
man 1 this has to be the bloody
coldest march in years
woman keep talking like that
well lose our party status
man 2
theyre a pack of lying hypocrites
man 1 keep it down will you
based on random audio sweeps
ive projected that right now
80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive
were also showing a 12percent increase
over last months positive mention
in all four quadrants
sutler mr creedy
were handling it as best we can
arrests are as high as theyve been
since the reclamation
i want more than arrests i want results

and only one chance to save your life
you must tell us the identity
or whereabouts
of code name v
if your information leads to his capture
you will be released
from this facility immediately
do you understand what im telling you
you can return to your life miss hammond
all you have to do is cooperate
process her
sobbing
evey crying
screaming sobbing
door opens
squeaking
rustling
womans voice
i know theres no way i can convince you
this is not one of their tricks
but i dont care
i am me
my name is valerie
i dont think ill live much longer
i wanted to tell someone about my life
this is the only autobiography
that i will ever write and god
im writing it on toilet paper
i was born in nottingham in 1985
i dont remember much
of those early years
but i do remember the rain
my grandmother owned a farm
in tottle brook
and she used to tell me
that god was in the rain
i passed my 11 plus
and went to girls grammar
it was at school
that i met my first girlfriend
her name was sarah
it was her wrists
they were beautiful
i thought we would
love each other forever
i remember our teacher telling us
that it was an adolescent phase
that people outgrew
sarah did
i didnt
in 2002 i fell in love
with a girl named christina
that year i came out to my parents
shouting indistinctly
valerie i couldnt have done it
without chris holding my hand
my father wouldnt look at me
he told me to go and never come back
woman crying
valerie my mother said nothing
but id only told them the truth
was that so selfish
our integrity sells for so little
but it is all we really have
it is the very last inch of us
but within that inch
we are free
man
it ends whenever you want it to
just tell us where he is
i dont know
valerie id always known
what i wanted to do with my life
and in 2015 i starred in my first film
the salt flats
it was the most important role of my life
not because of my career
but because that was how i met ruth
the first time we kissed
i knew i never wanted to kiss
any other lips but hers again
we moved to a small flat
in london together
she grew scarlet carsons for me
in our window box
and our place always smelt of roses
those were the best years of my life
but americas war grew worse and worse
and eventually came to london
the bill proposed by the undersecretary
for defense adam sutler
to close the remaining tube stations
passed with nearuniversal
valerie
after that there were no roses anymore
not for anyone
man you wont last much longer
youre gonna die here
why protect someone
who doesnt give a shit about you
door slams locks
valerie i remember how the meaning
of words began to change
how unfamiliar words like collateral
and rendition became frightening
while things like norsefire and the
articles of allegiance became powerful
i remember how different
became dangerous
i still dont understand it
why they hate us so much
grunts
valerie they took ruth
while she was out buying food
ive never cried so hard in my life
it wasnt long till they came for me
it seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place
but for three years
i had roses and apologized to no one
i shall die here
every inch of me shall perish
every inch
but one
an inch
it is small and it is fragile
and it is the only thing
in the world worth having
we must never lose it or give it away
we must never let them take it from us
i hope that whoever you are
you escape this place
i hope that the world turns
and that things get better
but what i hope most of all
is that you understand what i mean
when i tell you that
even though i do not know you
and even though
i may never meet you
laugh with you cry with you
or kiss you
i love you
with all my heart
i love you
valerie
man im instructed to inform you
that you have been convicted
by special tribunal
and that unless you are ready
to offer your cooperation
you are to be executed
do you understand what im telling you
yes
are you ready to cooperate
no
very well
escort miss hammond back to her cell
arrange a detail of six men
and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her
man its time
im ready
man look all they want
is one little piece of information
just give them something anything
thank you
but id rather die
behind the chemical sheds
man then you have no fear anymore
youre completely free
what
hello evey
you
it was you
yeah
that wasnt real
is gordon
im sorry but mr deitrichs dead
i thought theyd arrest him
but when they found a koran
in his house they had him executed
oh god
fortunately i got to you before they did
you got to me
you did this to me
you cut my hair
you tortured me
you tortured me
why
v you said you wanted to live without
fear i wish thered been an easier way
but there wasnt
oh my god
i know you may never forgive me
but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me
every day i saw in myself
everything you see in me now
every day i wanted to end it
but each time you refused to give in
i knew i couldnt
youre sick youre evil
you could have ended it
you could have given in but you didnt
why
leave me alone i hate you
v thats it see at first
i thought it was hate too
hate was all i knew
it built my world imprisoned me
taught me how to eat
how to drink how to breathe
i thought id die
with all the hate in my veins
but then something happened
it happened to me
just as it happened to you
shut up i dont want to hear
your lies
v your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth
yes i created a lie
but because you believed it
you found something true about yourself
no
what was true in that cell is true now
what you felt in there
has nothing to do with me
i cant feel anything anymore
dont run from it evey
youve been running all your life
gasping
i cant cant breathe
asthma when i was little
listen to me evey
this may be the most important moment
of your life commit to it
sobbing
they took your parents from you
they took your brother from you
they put you in a cell
and took everything they could take
except your life
and you believed that was all
there was didnt you
the only thing you had left
was your life but it wasnt
oh please
you found something else
in that cell you found something
that mattered more to you than life
when they threatened to kill you
unless you gave them what they wanted
you told them youd rather die
you faced your death evey
you were calm you were still
try to feel now what you felt then
oh god
i felt
v yes
im dizzy
i need air
please i need to be outside
v theres a lift
itll take us to the roof
thunder rumbling
god is in the rain
crying
shouts
cat powers i found a reason playing
v
im leaving
there are 872 songs in here
ive listened to them all
but ive never danced to any of them
did you hear me
yes
i cant stay here
v i know
well you wont find
any more locked doors here
i thought about keeping this
but it didnt seem right
knowing you wrote it
i didnt
may i show you something before you go
she was real
yes
shes beautiful
did you know her
no
she wrote the letter
just before she died
and i delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me
then it really happened didnt it
yes
you were in the cell next to her
and thats what this is all about
youre getting back at them
for what they did to her
and to you
what was done to me created me
its a basic principle of the universe
that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction
is that how you see it
like an equation
what was done to me was monstrous
and they created a monster
do you know where youll go
no
that would have scared me before
but i suppose i should thank you
well
thank you
goodbye
evey
may i ask you for something
if i had one wish i would wish
to see you again if only once
before the 5th
all right
thank you
sobbing
heyer chancellor i know no one
seems to want to discuss this
but if were to be prepared
for any eventuality
then it cant be ignored any longer
the red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists
now it concludes that
the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use
would be an airborne attack
a separate report has been filed
suggesting a train despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding parliament
have been sealed shut
who filed that report
heyer chief inspector finch
do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion mr finch
no sir just a feeling
if i am sure of anything inspector
it is that this government wont survive
if it is to be subject to your feelings
mr dascomb what we need right now
is a clear message
to the people of this country
this message must be read
in every newspaper
heard on every radio
seen on every television
this message must resound
throughout the entire interlink
i want this country to realize
that we stand on the edge of oblivion
i want every man woman and child to
understand how close we are to chaos
i want everyone
to remember why they need us
in the former united states civil war
continues to devastate the midwest
scientists attribute this water shortage
to the lack of rainfall the last two years
ministry officials expect
water coupon prices to rise
police have arrested nine suspects
can you believe this shit
been going on all summer
outside the quarantine zone a new
airborne pathogen has killed 27 people
authorities uncovered new evidence
linking the terrorist organization called v
to the st marys viral attack
on london 14 years ago
device beeps
dominic my friend inside the finger
came up with something
there were three men
covert intel
original blackbaggers
all under creedy
finch alan percy robert keyes
william rookwood
the day after the st marys outbreak
percy gives his beretta a blowjob
keyes dies in a fire
rookwood goes missing
bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach
rookwood
how do i know that name
dominic holy shit he must have had
a hidden trip on his file at the finger
but howd he know it was you
what do we do
im a cop i have to know
i came when they opened it
it gave me the collywobbles
still does
thats close enough inspector
device beeps
were not wired
im sorry but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution
you have information for us
no you already have the information
all the names and dates
are inside your head
what you want
what you really need is a story
a story can be true or false
i leave such judgments to you
inspector
our story begins
as these stories often do
with a young upandcoming politician
hes a deeply religious man
and a member of the conservative party
hes completely singleminded and
has no regard for the political process
the more power he attains
the more obvious his zealotry
and the more aggressive
his supporters become
eventually his party launches a special
project in the name of national security
at first its believed to be a search
for biological weapons
and its pursued without regard
to its cost
however the true goal
of this project is power
complete and total hegemonic domination
the project however ends violently
but the efforts of those involved
are not in vain
for a new ability to wage war is born
from the blood of one of the victims
imagine a virus
the most terrifying virus you can
and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure
but if your ultimate goal is power
how best to use such a weapon
well its at this point in our story
that along comes a spider
a man seemingly without a conscience
for whom the ends
always justify the means
and its he who suggests that their target
should not be an enemy of the country
but rather the country itself
three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack
a school a tube station
and a watertreatment plant
several hundred die
within the first few weeks
three waters has in fact
been contaminated
authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread
sent a wave of destruction
through the underground
rookwood fueled by the media
fear and panic spread quickly
fracturing and dividing
the country until at last
the true goal comes into view
before the st marys crises
no one wouldve predicted the results
of the election that year no one
and then not long after the election
io and behold a miracle
some believed it was the work
of god himself
but it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members
that made them all obscenely rich
a year later several extremists are tried
found guilty and executed
while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims
but the end result
the true genius of the plan was the fear
fear became the ultimate tool
of this government
through it our politician
was ultimately appointed
to the newly created position
of high chancellor
the rest as they say is history
can you prove any of this
why do you think im still alive
all right wed like to take you into
protective custody mr rookwood
im sure you would
but if you want that recording
youll do what i tell you to do
put creedy under 24hour surveillance
when i feel safe he cant pick his nose
without you knowing
ill contact you again
till then cheerio
finch rookwood
why didnt you come forward before
what were you waiting for
well for you inspector
i needed you
v shh shh shh
beethovens symphony no 5
playing over speaker
whats he doing in the dark there
creepy creedy
not sure i wanna know
sutler can no longer trust you
can he mr creedy
and we both know why
after i destroy parliament
his only chance will be to offer them
someone else some other piece of meat
and who will that be
you mr creedy
a man as smart as you
has probably considered this
a man as smart as you
probably has a plan
that plan is the reason
sutler no longer trusts you
its the reason why
youre being watched right now
why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house
and a tap on every phone
bollocks
oh a man as smart as you i think
knows otherwise
what do you want
sutler
come now mr creedy
you knew this was coming
you knew that one day itd be you or him
thats why sutlers been kept
underground for security purposes
thats why there are several
of your men close to sutler
men that can be counted on
all you have to do is say the word
what do i get out of this deal
me
if you accept
put an x on your front door
why should i trust you
because its the only way
youre ever going to stop me
upbeat music playing on tv
dantes it is not my sword mondego

of the 137th ward at southend
we found him
found who
william rookwood
the one youre looking for
i saw your report a couple weeks back
thought id run it through our john does
i hooked him perfect dental match
a floater fishermen picked him up
no id never solved till now that is
william rookwood is dead
id say so twenty years now
goddamn it
that son of a bitch sat there
and spoonfed me that bullshit
and i ate it up
so what do we do now inspector
we do what we should
have been doing
we find him
spray can hissing
spray can rattling
every day gentlemen
every day that brings us closer
to november
every day that man remains free
is one more failure
three hundred and fortyseven days
gentlemen
three hundred and fortyseven failures
chancellor we do not have
the adequate force
we are being buried beneath the avalanche
of your inadequacies mr creedy
doorbell rings
ill get it
eric finch
yeah
bloody hell
phones ringing
how many went out
so far we count eight boxcars
several hundred thousand at least
christ
i want anyone caught
with one of those masks arrested
man give me the money
give me the fucking money
were under siege here
the whole citys gone mad
this is exactly what he wants
what
man anarchy in the uk
chaos
mr creedy i am holding you
personally responsible for this situation
finch the problem is that he knows us
better than we know ourselves
thats why i went to larkhill last night
thats outside quarantine
i had to see it
there wasnt much left
but when i was there it was strange
i suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected
like i could see the whole thing
one long chain of events that stretched
all the way back before larkhill
i felt like i could see everything
that had happened
and everything that was going to happen
fingerman hey you
it was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me
and i realized that
we were all a part of it
and all trapped by it
bell tolls
so do you know whats gonna happen
no it was a feeling
but i can guess
with so much chaos
someone will do something stupid
and when they do
things will turn nasty
inaudible
rioters were arrested in brixton
and then sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do
at which point
all v needs to do is keep his word
and then
clock beeps
richard hawleys long black train
playing on radio
tonights your big night
you ready for it
are we ready for it
julie londons cry me a river
playing on jukebox
i missed this song
v i didnt think youd come
i said i would
ah
you look well
thank you
v may i inquire as to how
youve avoided detection
a fake id works better
than a guy fawkes mask
v chuckles
i must confess every time
i heard a siren i worried about you
i worried about myself for a while
but then one day i was at a market
and a friend someone i had worked
with at the btn got in line behind me
i was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money i dropped it
my friend picked it up
and handed it to me
she looked at me right in the eyes
didnt recognize me
whatever you did to me worked better
than id have imagined
i have a gift for you evey
but before i give it to you
id like to ask you something
would you dance with me
now on the eve of your revolution
v oh a revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having
id love to
tonight i will speak directly
to these people
and make the situation
perfectly clear to them
the security of this nation depends
on complete and total compliance
tonight any protester
any instigator or agitator
will be made example of
clearing throat
chancellor there is a contingency
that has not been addressed
and what is that mr dascomb
should the terrorist succeed
he wont
i understand that it is highly unlikely
but if he does
if he does and something happens
to that building
the only thing that will change
the only difference it will make
is that tomorrow morning
instead of a newspaper
i will be reading
mr creedys resignation
antony and the johnsons bird gerhl
playing on jukebox
youve been busy
theyre very scared right now
i heard sutlers going to make
a public statement tonight
hmm its nearly time
the masks were ingenious
it was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere
conceal me what i am and be my aid
for such disguise as haply
shall become the form of my intent
evey twelfth night
viola
i dont understand
what
how you can be one of the most
important things thats happened to me
and yet i know
almost nothing about you
i dont know where you were born
who your parents were
if you had any brothers or sisters
i dont even know
what you really look like
evey please
there is a face beneath this mask
but its not me
im no more that face than i am
the muscles beneath it
or the bones beneath them
i understand
thank you
there isnt much time
i have something i must give you
i went by parliament
never seen anything like it
tanks antiaircraft infantry
makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight
but if they do
what do you think will happen
what usually happens
when people without guns
stand up to people with guns
pull over here
weve searched these tunnels for weeks
you think youre gonna find him now
inspector
its all gone wrong hasnt it
the underground
i thought they closed this all down
they did
it took nearly 10 years to
clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own
let me show you
these tracks lead to parliament
yes
then its really going to happen
isnt it
v it will if you want it to
what
this is my gift to you evey
everything that i have my home
my books the gallery this train
im leaving to you to do with
what you will
is this another trick v
v no no more tricks no more lies
only truth
and the truth is you made me
understand that i was wrong
that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make
why
because this world
the world that im a part of and
that i helped shape will end tonight
and tomorrow
a different world will begin
that different people will shape
and this choice belongs to them
where are you going
the time has come for me
to meet my maker
and to repay him in kind
for all that hes done
v wait
please you dont have to do this
you could let it go
we could leave here together
no you were right about what i am
i have no tree waiting for me
all i want all i deserve
is at the end of that tunnel
thats not true
i cant
my fellow englishmen
tonight our country
that which we stand for
and all that we hold dear
faces a grave and terrible threat
soldier the areas clean sir
this violent and unparalleled assault
to our security
will not go undefended
where is he
or unpunished
v penny for the guy
our enemy is an insidious one
seeking to divide us
and destroy the very foundation
of our great nation
v i have kept my side of the bargain
but have you kept yours
bring him down
tonight we must remain steadfast
we must remain determined
but most of all we must remain united
those caught tonight
in violation of curfew
will be considered in league
with our enemy
and prosecuted as a terrorist
without leniency or exception
i want to see his face
tonight i give you my most solemn vow
thatjustice will be swift
it will be righteous
and it will be without mercy
oh god no
v at last we finally meet
sobbing
i have something for you chancellor
a farewell gift
for all the things youve done
for the things you might have done
and for the only thing you have left
goodbye chancellor
mr creedy
disgusting
gunshot echoes
now thats done with
its time to have a look at your face
take off your mask
v no
men grunting
defiant to the end huh
you wont cry like him will you
youre not afraid of death
youre like me
the only thing you and i
have in common mr creedy
is were both about to die
how do you imagine thats gonna happen
with my hands around your neck
bollocks
what are you gonna do huh
weve swept this place
youve got nothing
nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks
we have guns
no you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty
im no longer standing because if i am
youll all be dead before youve reloaded
thats impossible
kill him
breathing heavily
v my turn
yells
screams
die die
why wont you die
gun clicks
why wont you die
beneath this mask
there is more than flesh
beneath this mask there is an idea
mr creedy
and ideas are bulletproof
bone snaps
panting
grunting
helicopter whirring
this is perimeter one
whitehall is secure over
man this is general ackroyd
keep communication tight
i wont have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is
v
v gasping
oh god we have to stop your bleeding
please dont
im finished and glad of it
dont say that
i told you only truth
for 20 years i sought only this day
nothing else existed
until i saw you
then everything changed
i fell in love with you evey
like i no longer believed i could
v i dont want you to die
thats the most beautiful thing
you could have ever given me
v
v
sobbing
eyes and ears have detected movement
heading towards trafalgar square
this is perimeter one
we have enemy contact
hold it stop right there
youre evey hammond arent you
then its over
almost
stop get your hand off that lever
no
lieutenant enemy is approaching fast
requesting orders
what shall we do
no response from command
or from party leader creedy
or from the high chancellor
why are you doing this
because he was right
about what
that this country needs more than
a building right now it needs hope
bloody hell stand down stand down
jesus bloody christ
bell tolling
its time
tell me
do you like music mr finch
tchaikovskys 1812 overture
playing over speakers
that music

my brother
