well  ma am 
it s my intent to cooperate with whatever you need 
i mean  as an american 
i know you re just doin  your job 
and sometimes innocent folks like

it s like the airlines 
they don t lose your luggage on purpose  right 
but everybody takes it
so damn personal 
deb  come on  mr  stigman 
so you wanna play games 
well  what d you have in mind 
 clicks tongue

 door buzzing open 
 mouths  wow

 door buzzes open 
 door closes 
where d you hide

in return for cocaine 
right 
hey  bobby

man  your boy stig s a piece of work 
he winked at you 
didn t he 
how d you know 
bobby didn t
get the cocaine 
deb  what 
what happened 
papi offered me cash 
i told him no 
i told him
to keep the passports 
so  eventually 
he s gotta come up with the cocaine 
what about this guy you said you could flip 
little toro 
i got him 
it s real close 
i don t know
who you are anymore 
it s like

and you re sayin 
that to say what 
i don t like goin  to the funerals of my own men 
well  then don t come  boss

you don t get to be jealous anymore  bobby 
harvey 
you pushed me away 
so you could
be with harvey 
fuck you 
you told jessup you were close to flipping him 
i was 
but when i got
down to the ranch 
papi s boys was throwin  his head around in a bag 
well  that s game  then 
with little toro off the board 
jessup s pulling you out 
not if you
don t tell him 
i m your control  bobby 
that s correct 
i have to tell him 
that s why i need you
to let me rob
tres cruces savings and loan 
no  stig wants to rob
the bank  it s his idea 
so there s no entrapment 
what i want
is access to that money
that papi s got
in the safe deposit box 
you know no judge
is gonna give you
a blanket warrant
for the boxes 
we don t need a warrant 
not if the money s evidence in a crime 
we just trace it
back to ownership 
we got papi on tax evasion 
possible rico 
yeah 
yeah 
and what about stig 
what about him 
he s a side dish 
he does a smooth 20 years in the penitentiary 
you get a medal 
the bank gets us papi 
and that s all
that matters  right 
it takes whatever
it takes  baby 
did you ever
really love me 
hmm 
i really meant
to love you 
 knocking rhythmically 
shit 
 laughs 
you don t have to knock 
it s always open 
yeah  good 
let s hit the bank 
let s hit the bank 
the tres cruces

it s just   
have you ever had anything
like that happen to you before 
i mean 
they were 100  convinced we were holding 
and we would ve if papi hadn t welched on that coke 
so you re sayin 
that to say what 
i m sayin  it s only  cause you re hearin  it 
no  you sayin  somethin  
and if you sayin  it 
i m hearin  it  cause you re sayin  it

commander quince 
the united states navy
does not rob banks 
its personnel
did not rob a bank 
i m not gonna tarnish the integrity
of the navy over one crooked sailor 
if there was money
taken from the bank
that was part of
an illegal cia slush fund 
the navy had no knowledge
the fund existed
