im your control bobby
thats correct
i have to tell him
thats why i need you
to let me rob
tres cruces savings and loan
no stig wants to rob
the bank its his idea
so theres no entrapment
what i want
is access to that money
that papis got
in the safe deposit box
you know no judge
is gonna give you
a blanket warrant
for the boxes
we dont need a warrant
not if the moneys evidence in a crime
we just trace it
back to ownership
we got papi on tax evasion
possible rico
yeah
yeah
and what about stig
what about him
hes a side dish
he does a smooth 20 years in the penitentiary

commander quince
the united states navy
does not rob banks
its personnel

im not gonna tarnish the integrity
of the navy over one crooked sailor
if there was money
taken from the bank
that was part of
an illegal cia slush fund
the navy had no knowledge
the fund existed
your jacket has you
six months awol
yes sir

commander quinces jacket will likewise
be amended so hes also awol
making none of this
the navys problem

you chop it off
to save the body
you dont keep the pinkie around
just because it meant well
have petty officer stigman
dropped outside the main gate
he sets foot on a military base anywhere in the world
